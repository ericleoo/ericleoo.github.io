* About me
I'm Eric. I'm a fourth year Computer Science undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.
* About this website
I use this website for notes only. I am taking notes of my university courses using emacs org-mode. Most of the pages in this website is exported from org-mode, so all pages are very traditional.
