The Markets!
To All: It's an interesting corner that the Euro people (BIS) have put the US government and the dollar into. As the only reserve currency, the dollar must fall in value in order to reflate the world economy. But, a week dollar is exactly what the Treasury doesn't need with the upcoming Euro. Now, all Europe has to do is wait and watch as the markets do their dirty work! If the dollar stays strong, the countries in crisis will sink even lower. In doing so this will create a US trade deficit never before seen in modern times.

It is no accident that most of the economies in crisis are many of the chief trading partners of America. It's also no accident that they all are IMF/Dollar advocates. Meaning, they hold little Gold and much US treasury debt as local currency reserves. The US will be forced, by deteriorating market conditions, to lower the exchange value of the dollar. But, if Greenspan lowers local interest rates, Europe will begin to dump the dollar. For them, they don't need the dollar as a reserve currency anymore! They will hold a small amount of it only as an currency exchange intervention vehicle.

With this new definition for the dollar it will be required to carry a good interest rate. They have the Dollar in a trap that will force the Fed to lower it's value through the foreign exchange window. All the while pushing interest rates up or holding them steady to protect this reserve currency.

This isn't a strange twist as it happened once before during the 70's. Only this time a new world reserve currency is coming online, giving many countries a choice for the first time. I think China can't wait to unload it's US treasury holdings for the Euro.

I agree with Another's last post (in the archives) about the vintage wine. Gold is that reserve vintage that many people kept trying to open before it's time. By the end of the year, the currency wars will bring this fine wine to completion.

Once it goes above $360 some major defaults will occur, changing the entire aspect of the market. Add to this the introduction of the Euro and the old US Dollar gold market will disappear. Some investors are buying gold for the Y2K problem. I thing the Currency Wars will destroy the markets long before Y2K does it's deed!

Also, I am very excited to hear of this USAGOLD FORUM. I think myself and Another will have much participation with this new discussion group! It will, no doubt, be followed by many Gold investors. Who knows, perhaps even a Central Banker or Government leader? Thanks FOA

TO BNACD:
We continue to watch the BOJ to see if they are selling US Treasury debt. I don't think that is going to happen. They will buy gold, they will talk a great deal, but they can't sell US debt held as reserves. Why? From the beginning Japan has tied it's future to a US dollar world. They built their economic engine by trading with America using a dollar surplus mode. From a USA viewpoint, that's a balance of trade deficit in American dollar currency. It was always a week Yen (in real terms) that created the demand for goods made in Japan. The huge balance of payments surplus, held by Japan in world reserve currency dollars gave them the reserve assets to grow their economy. As governments manipulated currency exchange rates (known as the dirty float) for the benefit of an IMF/Dollar reserve system, this action gave Japan an enormous advantage in trade and finance. As this has gone on for over twenty five years, Tokyo could not help but represent a bloated financial system. Today, they have reached an end that no one ever thought would come; the dollar reserve system is ending.

As one might expect, Japan having received the largest return for supporting this system, will now suffer the largest loss. They simply do not know how to play a different game. The Yen will one day fall with the dollar. Will the BOJ buy enough gold through the BIS to offset the complete destruction of their financial system? They will no doubt try, but I doubt their is enough gold out there to make a difference. At present valuations, all the gold held by Central Banks is worth what, 300 billion dollars? If we doubled or tripled it the amounts would make but a small speck compared to the loss of the second largest financial system in the world.

You see, the current supply and demand for gold as a commodity or weather one CB is buying or selling some of it today is really a non-event compared to a changing World Financial System. For the regular citizen, gold priced in the many thousands will have little effect compared to oil priced at $200 or $400 a barrel!

My friend, we are coming into changing times as never before. It will be here, on the USAGOLD Forum that we will follow these events. As Another would say, "We watch this new gold market together, Yes?"! Be assured, he will post here as soon as this site is known to be open. Thanks

My last post was to your 18:29. Also, I somehow double posted? Because not many are here, perhaps we willtalk for a while. I expect Another will send something if able. I will reply to your 19:30. Thanks

BMACD:
Here are a couple of items I read from someone else:

"The China Daily published a special report from the Chinese state planning commission that outlines a plan to reallocate foreign reserves ratios away from U.S. dollar holdings. It recommends reducing U.S. dollars as a percentage of reserves from 60 percent to 40 percent. This suggests U.S. dollar sales of $28 billion. The report went on to say that China should prepare for a weaker U.S. dollar on grounds that the U.S.(as a net debtor) consumption boom has created a Bubble."

Also:

"CHINA MAY BE FORCED TO TURN RESERVES INTO EUROS: ECONOMIST BEIJING, Sept 3 ( AFEC/AGENCIES ) - China may be forced to switch much its enormous foreign currency reserves into the new Euro if the dollar falls in the future, a leading economist was quoted as saying Thursday. While there has been widespread speculation over a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, state development planning commission economist Wang Jian said China would have to watch for any fall in the dollar when elaborating its economic policies, the official China Daily newspaper reported. Wang said the US economic boom of recent years was a "bubble," caused by a massive influx of foreign capital, which could burst when the Euro is introduced on January 1. China has around 140 billion dollars' worth of reserves, with about 60 percent denominated in dollars, the China Daily said. It also has around 60 billion dollars of US treasury bonds. Wang said China would reschedule its reserves so there was around 40 percent in dollars, 40 percent in the Euro and 20 percent in Japanese yen. China currently also has German marks, Swiss francs and yen reserves. The Euro is to be launched with 11 European members from January 1 next year. The government has insisted in recent weeks that it does not intend to devalue the yuan, inspite of the Asian crisis which has undermined its exports, and that it was ready to use its huge reserves to maintain the official parity. "

I think the question of the Euro will be answered by the actions of the official government Central Banks. For a citizen living in Europe and using the Euro, it will become the best of all worlds. Not much different from the American using dollars to buy goods (in discounted real terms) from Japan or any other third world country. Only, now the shoe will be on the other foot with the USA trying desperately to sell it's goods to Europe for EUROS. This will be another strange twist as many/most of Americas foreign goods producers will, by then have stopped using dollars as reserve assets.

The outcome of a change in reserve currency is mind numbing. For the small person outside of Europe, they should "Follow in the Footsteps" of others. The holding of physical gold can and will be considered holding a currency asset as will the holding of Euros. However, the Euro will not come remotely close to the appreciation of gold as valued against all things. The ECB and the BIS will make it that way. You sir (or Ms.) will see this come to pass. Thanks

Before I continue, I want to thank Mr. Kosares for creating this Forum. This effort by USAGOLD will reward many readers with interesting discussion and debate about the future of gold in the world society. Michael, thank you!

Also:

BMACD: In reply to your 20:48. Hashimoto made the comment, but what position do we find Mr.Yen in now? I think it was a comment created by political need at the time. What would happen if Japan sold (dumped if you will) their US dollar reserves on the world market and/or brought Gold with the proceeds? Even if the Federal Reserve purchased some of the debt, it would no doubt drive down the value of the dollar. But this action would not help their economy as they still operate worldwide in a dollar reserve system. The dollar price of gold would rise, but not enough to liquefy their financial burden. In short, they still have to sell goods and services to the world, in order to raise their GDP. This will not happen if the Yen appreciates against all other currencies!

As you can see, this is the box they are in. It is also the predicament many other countries are in that operate using the dollar as a reserve currency. For many of them, a rise in the dollar price of gold will not help them, yet. Gold has not been brought to the forefront as a true currency reserve asset. It will when the Euro is created. At that precise time these economies will have a new market for their goods and they will accept payment in a new reserve currency.

Until this reality becomes apparent, the world financial system will continue to slide down the dollar reserve slope. This slide will create the illusion of a economic deflation, but then isn't the dollar really an illusion also? Thanks

Aragorn III (9/21/98; 16:07:21 Msg ID:71)
Mr. Aragorn, Your write offers good thoughts. I also often question why a person would want to hold the "silver for the little person"? Indeed, the gold can be divided into very small parts and still it holds the good value. I think the silver issue comes from the same view point that gold should not be "up valued" against paper currencies. It has always been seen that an official reset of the gold price is "the bad thing". Always, it is "at all costs do not raise gold price"!

The political Western stand is "Give the citizens silver and let that price rise, but, keep the gold low and we purchace it for our well being". It would seem that those of the "democratic power" want to hold the gold for "insurance" (as Mr. TYoung rightly does) and never allow it's good effects to pass to the "little person", as you say. Perhaps we do still see the "human nature" at work with silver. Persons are always attracted to the leverage argument in any investment. Again, the western analysis uses the past dollar performance of silver to make the point of "it will rise at faster rate than gold". I think, if the past economic and monetary performance was to continue, this could be true. However, we come to the end of this era. The changing of a monetary system for the benefit of removing "debt load" does also require the changing of rules for past game!

History will be written as this: "we now know that in times of major financial change, real gold increases in value and holds that value far greater than any paper gold derivative" also " no other form of commodity (silver and platinum included), even food, was valued as gold". Even in times of past war, soldiers and citizens were found starving for food, but still, gold was found in the pockets, not food!
Thank You

Mr. Goldfly, Perhaps your question will be answered in the future we now approach. However, for today, if we place ourselves in the land of Russia at the entrance of the "once most strong bank". What price do you offer for gold to replace the lost savings account? It would seem that in the process to return a portion of your wealth, that does represent a "lifes productive efforts", any price for gold would be as "the bargain".

I do admit that it is not the good position for ones family to be in, as others will also bid for this opportunity to gain gold. Tomorrow, when you and your neighbor use Euros to purchase the gasoline, a much smaller supply of gold will be divided by the dollars in existence. Few will concede that gold could be so high, as at present, "dollars price gold". But few have known a time when "Gold priced dollars"! Thank You

TO: RAINMAN (9/22/98; 10:19:25 Msg ID:83)
Rainman, We do disagree on this reserves issue! To make my point I'll start with my most solid concept and work forward. First, people are the real backing for any currency/money. It doesn't make any difference if circulated money is gold or if circulated paper currency is backed by gold and silver. When no one will use it or accept it, money it is Not! All the gold and silver in the world could be stamped into coins and if people are not willing use it, it can't be money.

You have heard this called the confidence factor. Well, I think a persons confidence in money is built after money is seen working, not before. We are not born with this confidence, it comes only if money continues to buy goods and services at a constant price, over time. People will accept fluctuations in the buying power of money, but that tolerance has limits. Once currency starts to fluctuate in it's purchasing power or exchange rate, citizens begin to require other types of backing for their money in order to maintain confidence.

This backing, to maintain stability comes in only two forms that I know of. The currency can be turned in or exchanged for real items held by the government Treasury as backing (gold?). Or, the Central Bank can purchase the currency in the open market using Exchange Reserves as Backing. The obvious, well documented problem with this comes when the government doesn't have enough Backing to maintain confidence in the currency. As in the case of the dollar, they have created more currency unit obligations than they have Exchange Reserves Backing to defend it with. If the need arises. I know that you already fully understand how this works.

My point? Modern digital currencies are today defended in the open market with Currency Exchange Reserves, not Gold. Most countries call their gold reserves. But, no country today classifies it's Gold as Usable Exchange Reserves . The Euro will!

Of the 40 to 50 Billion in reserves that the ECB will hold to defend the Euro, some 15% will be Gold Bullion. Unlike currency reserves that will be sold to purchase Euros as defense, gold reserves will be added by selling Euros to buy gold from the EMCBs. At present, the dollar has only one competitor for reserve currency status on the world stage, gold.

The dollar has been made strong in a low gold price.

To compete with the dollar for world reserve recognition, the ECB will add Euros to the EMCB (European Member Central Banks) to replace their gold. The EMCB will then be free to purchase gold on the open market, using no longer needed US dollar reserves. Remember, the Euro will be the main currency reserve of Europe. The ECB will not have to sell it's currency dollar reserves as they are a small token amount for balance. The roaring price of gold in dollar terms will now make up the lions share of Real Reserves backing the Euro!

In this context, the ECB will have no problem using the new dollar gold valuations to cover any dollar commentments of it's overextended members. Now my friend, you have my view! Perhaps you now understand why some natural resource countries value gold today at a Far higher dollar price than currently exists! Thanks

Aragorn III (9/22/98; 16:13:17 Msg ID:94)
Aragorn, I doubt that the common man will feel there is gold in the Euro. He will know it but not fully understand it. The currency confidence factor comes from a strong positive exchange rate, much like that enjoyed by the dollar today. The average European will buy from the USA in the same way that Americans buy bargain goods from other countries. Using an overvalued dollar makes one feel as their is no inflation, even though there has been massive dollar currency inflation over the last twenty years (the real cause of price increases when the exchange rate is allowed to balance a negative trade deficit).

As for the Euro being a clean, unmanipulated money system? Of course not! There will be all kinds of problems, but they don't carry the debt that the dollar does after all these years of reserve currency status.

The Euro will be the lesser of the two evils. Perhaps by a factor of five. That is also why many major investors will hold gold as a proxy for Euros. Not to mention that it will increase in value a great deal. What exchange rate for gold in Euros? I think it will be more of a free market type system, but Another thinks $6,000 in todays dollar buying power. We shall see. Thanks for the consideration! I wanted to reply to your first posts but lost them? FOA

The direction of gold.
TO ALL: I think we now are now in one of the best periods for gold ever to occur. You have every hedge fund, trader and producer ready to short/sell into any major rise in the dollar price of gold. They will be wrong, this time!

During the lows a short time ago, major CBs were buying gold in small amounts through the BIS. All of the small sales announced by other CBs were taken in with ease. The BIS did not make a public announcement that these buying banks were behind this coordinated effort driven from the BIS. Many years ago this would have been the case. This time they will not want to start a panic with the Euro about to commence operation. Am I correct with this view?

We should see each pullback in gold stop at a higher price. These pullbacks will be used by major buyers to complete their acquisitions of gold and hence the distribution of dollars. Well before the end of the year, many will look back and understand that we will never see these dollar prices for gold again, ever! The same forces that confounded the efforts of gold theorists to explain the drop in price, will now confound them again. The next 18 months or less will give rise to this metal in a way that will have gold bull analysis calling for a large pullback. It will not happen. We will run through $400, $600, $800, $1,000 and on. Each time a pullback occurs, massive buying will ensue. For guidance, look to the US balance of trade deficit and a fast changing negative exchange rate for the dollar to chart the course.

Also, as this unfolds, look for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates solely for the purpose of defending the currency. A currency with a future that no longer holds resurve status. High rates will be of little help, much in the same way that Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Korea and others have raised rates to no avail. Some would call this an extreme view? From what I understand of this era, it is an extreme view for extreme times. Perhaps what Another has told me is true, "many are to comfortable with familiar habits of finance to understand the potential for change". We shall see! Thanks

WELCOME!
Welcome Tyler Rose and Aloha Pu\`ukani, I have seen these names before! TYoung, I agree with you that it would be really nice to have the archives so we could read them back in time. Aragorn III, that was some post! Good to see people writing their views for everyone to see. Questions are nice, but you can not follow a market properly without seeing it through everyone's eyes, both large and small. In this light these discussions make markets become real life events, impacting our real living habits through time. Not just a moving graph line on a computer screen. For the future, myself and a few others truly do think that these monetary changes will not only be something we see, but will be something we will feel in our homes. Our families and neighbors will have to make adjustments to account for the very events that we chronicle here. Thanks of considering! FOA

Tyler Rose, I don't think we are going back in time to a gold backed currency. Even as Aragorn III (id:112) spells out the possible correct way to divide the metals for one, he also shows that it is an undertaking that requires political agreement by most countries / Treasuries. An insurmountable task, for elected officials. I can't add to his post, but I can show more to think about! Unfortunately, the future for the Euro will most likely present an evolving monetary system that we in the audience must watch as the play unfolds. No doubt, if the world financial arena becomes bad enough, Europe could evolve back into a Gold Standard. They have been there before but human nature being as it is, this is not where they want to go.

The one positive aspect is that the Euro will become a major transactional currency for a larger functioning gold market. To unseat the dollar gold will have to be brought back as a true currency evaluation tool. Much more so than it is today.

Following these lines we can see that the world value of gold will have to increase many times in order to create a large enough pool of value to be of use in measuring the billions of currency obligations outstanding. Just as none of the governments, that supported the old London Gold Pool never wanted to re-value the gold price upward in their currencies, they will now be forced to accept an open gold market evaluation!

I fully expect a soaring gold price in US dollars to force the American Treasury to implement foreign exchange controls for it's currency. They will never accept the public vote of no confidence that gold will deliver. Note that none of this can take place during the time that the World gold market transforms from being a dollar settlement system. This was a function of the dollar reserve currency status that is soon to end. That transformation will be part of a financial panic that witnesses the default/liquidation of billions of dollar/gold assets, built up over many years. The trading of gold in dollars will stop for some time as these loses are worked out. Only after this debacle will gold be able to naturally trade in Euros exclusively.

I know this doesn't address all of your reflections, but I thought it needed to be put forth. I think all of this will be well discussed as events begin to play out. We shall see. Thanks

BC (9/23/98; 19:08:38MST - Msg ID:118)
BC, Hello! Will they be at greater risk than central banks with larger gold reserves? Yes and no. It depends on the productive capabilities of the country. I think we must remember that gold (in a goldbug interpretation) is money, not part of the goods and services it is traded for. If a country has something the world wants, the world will deliver gold to their door to pay for these productive efforts. The world may also deliver currencies acting as money. As long as we have an open market gold valuation to keep the paper money honest, any productive country can develop a positive balance of trade. This can create a surplus that could be used to add gold to the national treasury.

A nation selling it's gold cheap is no different from one that sells it's trees, land or any other real thing at two low a price. They made a mistake. To correct this they may also repurchase these real things with productive efforts. The whole argument of gold, currencies and debt comes from cheating by the Central Banks with a dirty float of exchange rates. In progression this leads to over creation of the currency by it's treasury. Further on, the real purchasing power of the national currencies can never represent the true productivity of the country. A better answer/reply to your question would be: In the future a CB with gold has a better chance of covering it's past mistakes than one that doesn't. A lot of past mistakes with too little gold does put them at risk. That risk being that the citizens will have to produce more for less. Thanks

bmacd, one last thing then I have to go. Canada (your home country) is a good example for my last post to BC. They are a fine group of hard working people, in a country full of natural assets that the world wants and does buy. Yet, by allowing their government to gamble with their currency in a effort to stay in a Dollar/IMF world monetary system, they are going broke! In time they would look like Russia if this system doesn't change. By selling their citizens gold, the stage is set for them to, again, dilute another productive part of the economy. That being to tax and/or grasp for the gold mines of the nation to minimize the CBs past mistakes! I think this is a real possibility that is never discussed by the industry in front of stockholders.

Possible large default in gold paper? LTCM
Thursday September 24, 6:50 am Eastern Time LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Gold rose then paused in early European trade on Thursday as bullion dealers sniffed a possible recovery in prices and looked to New York for guidance. London and Hong Kong dealers said another factor lifting prices was market talk that a U.S. hedge fund was covering short gold positions.

Michael, I'm looking for a large default in the paper gold market. With the major CB only buying now something is about to give as the most extended shorts can not cover. A default is most likely part of a game plan to get the ball rolling. This spike in gold will no doubt crush the dollar. The next few months will offer the last period of time to roll out of dollar assets at a good price. Of course, all of this is my opinion from and for the most part, Another's.

Goldfly, "By the end of this year" is laying it on the line"? I hope you didn't think I meant that gold would go to $1,000 by the end of the year! It could, under the right conditions. We will most likely see it begin a climb past the $330 / $340 area. Remember, if it gets past $360 before the Euro comes out, it would create a panic that could destroy many of the shorts. As you can see, a large portion of them are Hedge Funds! These same funds are big into currency trading. The disruption in the financial arena would , as Another has shown, be catastrophic! You wouldn't have an official gold market to buy from! Another has not sent me a reply yet, but later on we may get some discussion from him. FOA

Victoria, Welcome to the discussion group! It has taken a while to reply with the bugs in the Forum and on my end.

Many disagree with a physical gold only investment. Another has spent an enormous amount of time, writing how the times will be different in this era.

I think most of the diversion comes in where investors can not envision gold going up in price all that much. Most don't feel they can create a meaningful return through holding bullion only. The slant is always towards the leverage of mining companies. Most think they will be able to exit these securities and move to physical after some of the future rise in price is complete. That's good if we continue to progress into another economic cycle typical of the past. However, the American economic system is about to change in a way few can follow. The small person will come out far ahead of the large investors by holding onto gold through thick and thin.

As for the large Gold resource countries becoming more powerful? That's a good question that I would like to see others, including Another commit on. It gets right into the politics of money! Will oil rise with gold? I have to agree with Another, oil in dollar terms is going to go up out of sight. But then again, the dollar is also going to go down out of sight. I think these very items will get a good amount of coverage right here as time goes by. Thanks

ET, The swings in the markets (all markets) will get larger untill the average investor cannot stand it anymore. Remember, during the great German monetary inflation their stock market went wild, even by today's standards. Today, the people in the know, know the risk! They are playing the same game, with the same mindset of a currency holder. I can get out before anything goes wrong! The problem for them now is that they think the markets will stay open while they cash in, it won't!

YOUR PARTIAL QUESTION: "Would it become impossible and/or difficult for citizens to repatriate funds/assets held outside the country? It seems hard to imagine the chilling effect "currency controls" would have saying that holding gold outside the country under such circumstances might be unwise, too."?????

Ph, The possibility of FXC (Foreign Exchange Controls) is very real. This topic has been discussed in several well written books spanning 25 years. In a way, the closing of the gold window in the early 70s was a form of FXC. Anyone outside the country could no longer get their gold because too many dollars had been printed to cover the gold in the US treasury.

Today, to many derivatives have been printed (paper gold is one of them) than can be covered by the outstanding dollars! The US Federal Reserve either prints a load of dollars to cover this contingent or the system falls apart. If the Fed prints, the Americans get inflation. If the Fed doesn't print, the world financial system, based on a dollar reserve currency, starts to implode and foreign holders of dollar assets try to exchange these for their local currency. To do this they must take the dollar home to the USA for exchange! During this exchange, if the dollar loses to much value in the exchange rate, these foreign holders just SPEND THEM in America!

Again, the US experiences price inflation, only this time it's during a global deflation in dollar assets. To stop this chain of events, this time the US Treasury closes the dollar window. It's usually a last effort to hold the banking system together. The gold window was closed by holding gold at a low price valuation and not selling any of it. The dollar window will be closed by buying dollar currency at a rate so low as to stop most major holders from exchanging. This usually brings a two tier market , dollars inside the country worth more than outside the country. For some time, all dollars outside the US were called Eurodollars! Will we see these Eurodollars exchanged for Gold ???? In some countries, the CBs already have. Thanks

Others have built their fortune holding the debt of these traders. And now Default will follow default and all will look to settle for real things that become short in supply. Sir, the confidence in this dollar was purchased with "the greed of men". Soon, this "backing of greed " will lose the support of oil. For the value of a world currency is not made from the "fools gold" found in a gambling den. Thank You

ANOTHER & FOA-THINGS TO COME?
My Dear FOA,
Thank you for your prompt reply. If only some(NOT ALL) posters at Kitco were as courteous and gentlemanly as yourself and ANOTHER, Kitco would be much better off. IMVHO. Their loss is USAGolds gain. My views are very simple minded. I have not the brainpower or ability to dissect every little nuance in the markets and therefore try to analyze as best I can. My thinking is that the current currency crises occuring throughout the world was and is unsustainable. The FRB is between a rock and a hardplace. The strength of the dollar has to be decreased to help most currencies before a world wide depression took hold. In other words something has to be done before the dollars strength destroyed the world economy. My 1st thought was that the FRB would be forced to devalue the dollar by a rate cut. My 2nd thought was that this would be a temporary solution. The derivative markets have been in a no lose, win situation for several years due to such things as the yen-gold carry trades which in time were carried to extremes. That these would eventually default because the dollar would have to reverse course soon. Once this reverse happens, many highly leveraged derivatives would be caught in a squeeze that would put the dollar in jeopardy forcing the FRB to again change course and defend dollar by rate increases which in turn will tank the equity and bond markets. As you stated in a recent post that you and ANOTHER expected a major default which will mean the beginning of the end for the dollar. The recent hedge fund bailout is as you say only a small tip of the iceberg. More will surely follow as sure as day turns to night. Your prognostications such as a Jan 1988 post?(Can't find it for now) that some on Kitco used to trash ANOTHER predicting that a rush to cover may be difficult to contain and predicting that the price of gold would be $320-$360 by year end was and is right on as of now. Also your post on Jan 10, 1988-21:03 predicted with no uncertain terms that the BIS would not allow the price to go below $280 has also held to date within acceptable parameters. I am still trying to determine in my mind why a concerted mean spirited effort was made by certain posters on Kitco to so desperately squash your input and what their true motives were? We will watch closely as events unfold, yes? Thank you for listening to one of a simple mind who has as much faith that gold will triumph in the end as I have in God. Pete

Mr. Pete, This LTCM, it begins the beginning of your increase in wealth. As Mr. TYoung has spoken, I do add that; "these boys of summer have struck out"! This game will never be played beyond your shores again. As I write, all that hold the debts of America ask, "of what form does the collateral take"? The dollar is represented as the "gambler's tool" and of little use as a builder of wealth. This Euro, it does hold at least, "the pretense of respectability".

Sir, what you have written, it is done well. Follow this change of weather as it is at the door, perhaps it has entered your home as the new season for gold. Even I, myself will add flavor to this new gold market. Of the "mean spirited ones" you speak? They are seen in all the world as "boys that curse the wind, but a strong wind has no ears". Thank You

I have been forced to rethink any investment direction because of the input from A (Another). History shows that we get caught the worst when the times change. The banks are no different. They are run to make profits by people using the established architecture. Foreign currency accounts are not provided for customers with the intent of creating a vehicle to protect against changes in the national law (read that established architecture). If FXCs are implemented, your account is voided to some extent? Foreign currencies are just like your dollars, the bank doesn't hold them in the account. It's loaned out and the bank Credits you for the money. With FXCs they cannot import the real thing, even if asked to by a customer. Even if they could the new exchange rate would destroy your purpose for holding the account in the first place. That's my view on it? If anyone can show this to be incorrect, please do? FOA

BMACD:
bmacd,--------
Everyone all agrees that gold is a political metal. Having been used as real money (both in coin form and in paper receipt form) for thousands of years, it's natural human nature for governments to try and control it. It's nothing new and for generations, investors worldwide have come to expect it. Political structures will always manipulate whatever form of money is being used at the time. Today, they rework paper money on a grand scale no one could have ever believed only 30 years ago. People get very nervous as gold was worked over this last decade and fear to hold it through this process. Yet they hold paper currencies that, on a world scale, have been engineered to degrees that make the current gold markets fluctuations look normal! The same investors that have held Yen in 1990 at 64, then watched it go to 120 in 1995, and finally back to 72 in 1998! Now mind you, this is a major currency, not gold! We can also see it in reverse as American citizens held dollars in 1990 that would buy 156 yen, then in 1995 would buy 83 yen and back to 138 yen in 1998!
-------------
Bmacd, -----------
observe all the paper money today as it swings wildly on the exchange market. Those swings translate directly into major swings in price for every item traded in the world economy, not just gold! You may not see these price changes directly on the goods purchased as the fluctuations are absorbed through producers profits. But they are real never less. The market price for gold is not absorbed by anyone as it delivered directly to the buyer. But, then again, gold is also money so it is normal for it's exchange rate to change, just as any other currency does (Yen?). The notion that investors will not buy gold as it's exchange rate changes is ludicrous. In 1995 did Americans stop buying Yen when it suddenly became expensive with one dollar able to only buy 83? No. But it went up in price almost 100%. How could anyone afford it? You see, today we know gold is a major currency because it's being manipulated to no end, just like the rest of them.
----------------
What does all of this have to do with your question of the IMF? If gold is going to $170 in dollar terms, it's because the political powers want it there. It's a currency, and will be moved up and down. It doesn't fluctuate in simple commodity supply and demand terms. If it did we would have seen it much higher in all currency terms years ago. Trading of gold, on and off official markets dwarfs not only new mine supply but is even larger than all existing stocks. LBMA, trades a million ounces a day! And that is only what is seen. The IMF could sell it's gold currency assets in the same fashion that it could sell Dollars, Yen or Marks. A ready market exists.
-------------------
If gold is a currency to today's political movers and shakers, we need to see it in a different light. To understand gold, is to grasp that not all world entities want it to fall further in dollar terms. Just as government CBs battle over currency exchange rates, they also form opposing sides on gold valuations. Western investors may not view gold as an asset to evaluate the worth of circulating paper money, but many resource countries do! The value they place on a currency is directly related to how much gold it will buy. This view is not lost to ECU nations either. It's easy for them to see that the number of American dollar assets worldwide takes the valuation of the US gold holdings into the many thousands and makes the current illusion of gold in dollar terms a fraud from manipulation. They also know that the US gold is held in the Treasury, not the American Central Bank, and therefore does not represent any form of backing for the dollar.

Perhaps this is the reason that the Euro gold reserves will be held by the ECB (not the national treasury as none will exist for that entity) as part of the foreign exchange reserves that DO / WILL back the new currency. It's also easy to see that the reserve gold currently held by the EMCB will find no home on the dollar market as they will have too many dollars as it is. Even if Western analysis think the Euro will not fly, it's still a fact that it will be the reserve currency for the ECB and it's EMCBs. In the coming years they, the EMCBs, will be in need or more Euros for their expanding economy and the way they will get them will be to sell gold (at a much higher rate from today) to the ECB. This need for Euro money will be driven by countries that wish not only to sell products to Europe, but also to retain the Currency as a Foreign Exchange Reserve. In much the same way that dollars are retained today, nations with a balance of trade surplus with Europe will end up with extra Euros, the same Euros purchased with gold by the EMCBs. That gold will make the Euro a truly well backed strong currency in world eyes. Especially if the dollar price of gold is soaring!
------------------
Back to the IMF: That gold is the only remaining link that the dollar has to metal. It is also out of the US government's control. I believe Arabia has some control over the IMF and it's gold as they are major contributors of assets. Perhaps someone could correct this view? As Another has told me. "If the IMF sells gold, a good deal for someone , yes? Yes!

Also, a thought? If the dollar is the current world reserve currency and all dollars circulating outside the US are called Eurodollars. Then, If the Euro becomes the new world reserve currency, will all Euros outside Europe be called,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Dollareuros? Thanks FOA

My view.
Dec. comex gold did not make through $300 today, but it came close. Slowly the liquidity of physical supply, that was so available 24 months ago, is now drying up on world markets. The lease rates have not risen much simply because many of the Bullion Banks now understand the risk and don't want to supply leased gold for the purpose of covering the bad bets of others. In this process, the demand for borrowed gold falls away
---------------------------------------------------------
From the beginning gold was sold down to give strength to the dollar. As the process continued, funds, large traders and investors arrived on the seen with their own oversupply story as the reason to sell. We were told that gold was no longer an asset and it would fall in value for the rest of time! Now that they have told their story and made their sales, the true gold market is about to speak. It's not a story of oversupply or undersupply. It is a story of market need for a currency evaluation tool. A way for governments not supportive of the dollar to show it's true value through gold.
------------------------
Some of these short traders have already started to cover. But it will not be until gold moves into the low $300 range that they grasp how tight the market will have become by that time. It has taken years for this selling to build and it will not be covered in a few months. Perhaps many of them will have to be bailed out as LTCM was? We shall see.

USAGOLD, -------------- Your words:
"Would the Swiss central bank in a case like this be forced to lend UBS gold to pay their creditors, or face the prospect of Europe's largest bank going under?"

Michael, In the circumstance you describe, no CB would set the precedent of supplying gold to cover a gold contract (not of their making) that has failed! They may find themselves in a position of not having enough gold to cover all possible claims. This would also imply that it would be legal to use a nations gold in this way. It may not be.

I think, the major players on the receiving side of these gold contracts only deal in paper that would force the CB (or any supplier of gold) to perform in the event of a Bullion Bank failure. More often than not, the problem for the bank would be to collect the currency that was created from the proceeds of a gold loan. If that has been lost then they must purchase the gold back from the entity that it was sold to. If that is an option! Or the lender of the gold (CB) could extend the contract, however, once the contract is found to be in nonperformance, it all goes up in smoke! A mess indeed! Thanks

It looks as though we will have a rough day in the equity markets. Perhaps the quarter point drop in rates was not only a political move for LTCM, but also a market move to create a default situation for the derivative players. Once they are taken out, and their short positions received by new owners (banks), rates will begin to increase. This would certainly bail out these short positions, now held by the largest and most connected bank entities. No matter how it works out, the American dollar economy is about to be shaken as never before. I'll be in and out during the US market day. Good luck

Hope to post later today. Thanks for the consideration. FOA Rainman, You offer a different view of the present predicament the world finds itself in. While I do not hope to show where your thoughts are wrong, we may attempt to see this through different eyes. Not yours or mine, but others.
-------------------------------
Your words: "You assume in your post that the EMCB will eventually purchase GOLD in the open market . Isn't that wishful thinking?"

No sir, I would call it thoughtful thinking. The EMCBs (European Member Central Banks) are the CBs of the eleven nations that will join in monetary union. They hold a good deal of gold that was left over from previous monetary wars with the New World, America. You are correct that they lost that war in 1971 when the US closed the gold window. However, that was yesterday. My friend, the generals of lost wars have long memories. In those days countries wanted off the dollar hook more so for national reasons than financial. We now know that, compared to today, the dollar in 1971 was in great shape! The leverage of third world debt was nothing as compared to the current dilemma. The push to get gold in exchange for dollars, in that time, was precipitated by a belief that the present world currency crisis was to occur back then. Perhaps by 1978? What the history of world economic finance succeeded in teaching them was that they were wrong in their expectations of dollar debt EXCESS! I'll get back to the question of gold buying in a minute.
----------------------------------
Your words: "The US was able to export financial calamity to the world without paying the cost for years."

Absolutely correct! With the collapse of the gold wars, there was simply no competing currency that could function as the dollar in a reserve status. The oil countries saw this almost immediately and proceeded with the " Beruit Resolution" to allow them to compensate for any loss in purchasing power by the dollar. It would seem that even though America won the gold war they were still receiving "incomming" from other nations! Even so, the world was forced to accept the dollar. They didn't like it then and I can tell you, they like it even less now! ----------------------------------------------
Your words: "Nothing would prevent the US in this kind of circumstances to issue a new $ which would be exchanged at par domestically but on a different ratio (if anything at all ) externally."

Rainman, I read your words as a jump to present time. What you speak of is Foreign Exchange Controls (FXC) for the US dollar. I wrote a piece to PH in LA and others about FXCs. The only way the US would ever enact these controls would be in the event of a national economic emergency. For the last twenty + years to present America has run a Balance of Trade Deficit.

In other words they send dollars out of the country as they buy everything in sight as imports. It's the same thing you speak of above "able to export financial calamity to the world ". Without the ability to export dollars at a high exchange rate (read that manipulated strong dollar) for the benefit of US citizens, the American economy would revert back into a regular economic system. In other words, FXCs would block the very thing that keeps inflation low and the GDP running at a high rate. Never the less, in an economic emergency (the dollar coming home because it is no longer needed as a reserve asset) FXCs would be enacted because the resulting inflation would be ten times worse than without it!
------------------------------------------
Your words: "Most central bankers don't think in the same terms as most do on this site. They don't foresee the demise of whatever remains of the world financial system."

Well, I know someone that has the brain of a Central Banker and they are very concerned about the orderly progression of the world financial system. They are pragmatic in their belief that a currency system based on the dollar has indeed reached the end of it's ability to expand! What we are witnessing today shows that the world dollar debt load has reached it's limit and must be dealt with. In the current system, if the debt cannot expand, new money (purchasing power) can not be increased. No, the press will never print these views of CB leaders. But that is the nature of the political game. Always has been, always will be! Most Europeans have come to expect it and work and live around it. It's just the system.

As for what to do about the dollar? Back in 1980, the Europeans started the birth of the Euro. It began as the ECU (European Economic Unit). Much of the world has waited for this Euro in a period that seems like forever. During this time the world dollar remained the only game in town, and in consequence the only way to keep the economy alive. So the dollar debt was expanded in degrees no economist could have ever dreamed of. In fact, most of them thought the end was reached back in 1987! Boy, those were the good old days! We come to today, traveling on the back of a derivatives nightmare that from the beginning was the only, last way to expand debt further. It is done and none too soon as the Euro comes out in 1999!
------------------------------------------------------
Your words: "Moreover , W. DUISSENBERG more than any other , holds GOLD in extreme contempt. It was only under intense pressure from FRANCE , ITALY and GERMANY that he accepted to include any GOLD in these reserves. He was instrumental in engineering the sale of NETHERLAND CB 's GOLD in the last 2 years."

Rainman, --------you have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Yes, France Italy and Germany did apply pressure on the new ECB. But, that is the point, the ECB unlike the Federal Reserve that is controlled by a single power, will be controlled by three countries of different economic and financial purpose. This will create a balance never before seen in a world Central Bank as it controls the world reserve currency! Forget all the talk and conjecture about an independent ECB. That's just for show. The European citizens are far to knowledgeable of political motives to ever expect an un-manipulated Euro.

Still, the direction is clear, to appease a thinking populous the Euro can not act like a dollar. It will have debt and problems, but those will be neutralized with the initial demise of the dollar as a competitor. W. DUISSENBERG ? He's a good choice. Read his story of remarks over the past few years. I think the World Gold Council web site has a lot of it. He does have a slant towards gold and the EMCBs didn't have to push all that hard for it. Most of the squabble was public posturing anyway. He sold off the Netherlands gold to other CBs that in turn sold it to more important clients that they needed for Euro support. Mr. D thinks his country will prosper without gold in the Euro environment more so than other members. We shall see.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Your words: "Most of the bureaucrats who make a living from European institutions, including the ECB, hate GOLD to the same extent. Thus I don't see an open financial war being started with the US on such a controversial asset."

I think you give these bureaucrats more power than they have. Europe has far less of them than the US and they certainly don't have the political lobby support. They are just like everyone else, they talk and think their pocketbook. Presently gold has no influence on them as the entire region is functioning on a dollar standard. Sure they talk of selling gold, but they only look at it now as a way to raise money to pay debt. When the Euro begins and the economy strengthens because of a strong currency they will again talk their wallet.

I can hear it now, "Lets keep gold for our countries because we can see how the dollar has crashed in gold terms." and "We need to expand out currency base to increase out pensions so lets issue more Euros to the EMCBs for gold".

Rainman, I agree that the ECB will be just as bad as the FRB in the US. It's just that they will be further back in the time cycle of currencies. I have only so much time here on earth so I accept the notion that was told to me, "live with it" !
-----------------------------------------------------------
As for starting a financial war with the US, it's was already started long ago when they took the first steps to create what would obviously be a major block currency. The only difference today from 1971 is that the US dollar is tapped out to the limit! Again only time will resolve the outcome of this viewpoint. The same applies to the question of US armed support for Europe? My opinion is that if the US does have to intervene it will be because they want to save the world financial system! The New Euro financial system!
---------------------
My thoughts: As I have said before, the ECB will use newly printed Euros to buy gold from the existing stocks in the vaults of the EMCBs. That gold will be added to the present 40 to 50 billion in "exchange reserves" in the ECB to back the currency. In this process the EMCBs will receive what they really need for the future as all trade converts into Euro settlement. There will be demand for this currency so the only exchange intervention that will be necessary will be to sell Euros! Any dollar assets collected will be sold in the open market as dollar reserves will be useless for backing. More likely than not, these dollar sales will be seen as sending the currency home to the originator. If inflation or FXCs become a problem, then the dollar will be used to purchase gold on the open market, if there is one. There is more to it than this and I will ask Another to Chronicle these events for us as we proceed.

Your words: "However , no CB GOLD reserves in the US or EUROPE will save the system "

Oh yes it could. Remember, money and debts are but an illusion in human minds made real with ink on contract paper. People may be ignorant of high financial affairs, but stupid in the ways of real wealth they are not. Trash the entire paper currency system today and the basic human instinct from thousands of years of history would return. They would revalue gold and issue currency behind it on a pay as we go basis. Yes it would be the same old currency play, but after a world economic debacle none of the present politicians would be in power. Life goes on my friend. Thank you so much.

Hello Pete,--------------------------
Yes, I think you read it about right. It's chock full of political intrigue. For some time, Another has posted that dollar rates were about to be taken up, in his opinion, to defend the currency against the coming Euro. At this late stage of currency war preparations, it's world economy be dammed, the battle is about to begin. The LTCM group knew this, so they bet the farm on higher rates.
----------------------------
Pete, these people, at this level of power are not stupid. Gamblers, yes, stupid no! They work on real knowledge, not a traders guess as the press has portrayed them as doing. Problem is that their bet was as large as most countries and it would have caused a further CB embarrassment had so much money been made on an inside decision. I think they talked of lowering rates first to destroy their capital, then later took them over on the news. When it's done, rates will rise. That's why these major players are now selling off the Dow Jones on a rate cut, they know what's coming. Their position in the old LTCM portfolio will be sold off with a big profit, just as their old management had bet it would. The obvious portent from all of this is that the US economy is about to take a hit of unimaginable proportions from a currency war fought during a collapsing world economy. Wow!

Always good to hear all sides. RAINMAN : on Market Rap with Bill Fleckenstein, September 30, 1998, he had a interesting report
------------------------------------------------------------
"Golden development... Moving on to the gold market, the Belgian National Bank, governing council member of the ECB (European Central Bank), said "The bank has no need or desire to sell gold in the future to satisfy reserve restructuring."

The "in the future" part of the phrase is interesting because in the past the ECB commentary hasn't mentioned this. Another bullish development for gold. Bills page is at:

http://www.stocksite.com/features/contrarian/rap/

ALL: -------- This was part of the latest from WGC. I think the lease rate action will work in reverse as the Bullion Banks also draw away from servicing their clients. They (BBs) may not want to borrow gold (acting as the dealmaker) and risk having a contract go bad. This action would push lease rates down for a different reason, "no demand from the middleman"! ??? So, the action in gold rates, up or down may signal a bull move from lack of liquidity?

"In spite of the short covering, lease rates jumped, with the one-month rate climbing from 0.4% a week ago to 1.7% amid reports that central banks were beginning to exercise a good deal more caution over the quality of their immediate counterparties, the bullion dealers, and the ultimate beneficiaries of leased central bank gold, the short sellers. http://www.gold.org/Pages/Home1.htm

Hello PH, ------------ as I write this today the sun is shining not only on me but the gold market as well. The Comex Dec contract is up $2.00 US to $301.00 in after hours trading. It is my understanding that some entities are inquiring about for physical gold (not paper) to return leased material. Some of the old deals are in default? It makes perfect sense because, if the leased gold was sold to someone else, it's gone. What is left is the money from the sale and that may have been gambled away. Without the money or the assets that money purchased, there is no collateral to stand behind the lease contract for the security of re-acquiring gold. It's default time. Also, any and all derivatives that may have been used to leverage these assets further, such as gold OTC options, futures contracts (both on and off exchange) and LME paper is now floating with no coverage! In other words, these items are worthless unless the physical gold they are suppose to represent is purchased to cover. As TYoung would say "it's a whole new ball game". ---------------------------------------------- Your thoughts about LTCM come into play here. I don't think they actually sold gold short as the rumors say. These people only used the cheap cash, supplied by others, (3% rate?) from these sales to leverage themselves.

LTCM'S GOLD PLAY: THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT

By JOHN DIZARD

WHEN the Long-Term Capital
Management bailout became public
last month, there were stories
circulating in the market about a
gigantic short position it had set up in gold.

In other words, LTCM had borrowed a
lot of gold in the hope of buying it back later, ideally at a lower price.

Gold people believed that as this short
position, which they believed amounted
to hundreds of metric tons of gold, was
covered by purchases, it would add fuel
to the runup in the gold price.

I decided to check this story with
LTCMs p.r. firm and one of its people
dutifully reported back that Long-Term
had no gold position, long or short, and that the rumor had been started in an attempt to hike the gold price.

So I dropped it.

Now, based on extensive reporting
among gold market participants, I have
come to the conclusion that Long-Term
did not tell the truth.

I wouldn't have minded if they had said
no comment, but outright lying is
something else again. So my advice is
not to take these people's word in the
future.

A Long-Term spokesman reiterated his
previous statements on the fund's gold
position - or rather lack thereof.

According to my sources, by August
Long-Term had borrowed about three
hundred tons of gold. That's a lot, about $3 billion. After borrowing the gold they sold it in the market and used the proceeds to finance other positions, such as one in the Australian dollar.

Why do this?

If they wanted to borrow, why not go to
one of those overaccommodating
creditors and plain borrow dollars to
invest in securitized Antarctic
commercial mortgage forwards or
whatever other weird stuff they believed in that week?

Because the rates on borrowing gold
have been incredibly low - around 0.63
percent (annualized) if you borrowed it
yesterday for a month or 1.61 percent
(annualized) if you borrowed for six
months.

Usually, one-month loans are taken out
by speculators, and six-month or longer
loans are taken out by gold mines who
are going short gold in this manner so
as to balance out a long position that
they have from their mine production.

The problem, of course, is what
happens when the gold price goes up?
Gold has been in a bear market for 18
years, but theoretically, some day,
maybe now, the price in dollars will start to turn up in a bull market.

Mines don't have much of a problem,
because they can cover their short
selling out of what they produce. But a
hedge fund has to buy back gold, and
do so from a market that could turn
jumpy very fast.

Now apparently LTCM bought
out-of-the-money calls to hedge their
short position, which means that if the
gold price went up a lot, then they had
the right to limit their losses. But it didn't eliminate all their risk.

I understand that J. Aron, the gold
trading arm of Goldman, Sachs, has
been able to cover all or most of the
LTCM short in private transactions, with the intention of limiting the effect on the already stronger gold market.

So the Long-Term gold episode may
be drawing to a close.

What market participants have begun to
learn, though, is that the real danger to the system doesn't come from the
relative value hedge funds themselves,
which are in truth a very very small part of the financial system, but the banks and brokers who have been playing
hedge fund on a much bigger scale.

That's why the prices of companies
such as Bankers Trust, J.P. Morgan,
Merrill and Lehman have been marked
down so far.

How many of them have been doing
what is known as the gold carry trade?

Your question:

"To Another:
The NY Times and other papers ran an article on S.A calling on US oil co. to help them develop the kingdom's vast energy reserves. Saudis "desperately need capital to invest in their oil sector to keep the oil flowing" etc. How does this fit into your postings. On 10/19/97 part of the post Only one oil state counts, Gold very important to them, etc... Of course, I am assuming that S.A was the one oil state. Also, I believe you posted S.A. has enough oil for our parents, parents, grandparents. etc.. What is the real story behind this article. What and why does S. A. need US Oil Companys help. How does this fit into the US economy today with the oil for gold deal thats soon to end. Thanks by the way to Another, USA Gold for "book on Another" forum, etc. I've learned so much in such a short period of time."

Jayne,
You have seen the "business of oil" continue all of your days. It will also continue for all the lifetimes of those that follow you. This "business of oil" will always search for capital and expertise for it is this constant search that brings the results of "oil flow". However, we do not confuse the "conducting of business" with the "need for stable currency"!

Oil in the ground walks the quiet path and speaks with the modest voice. The power of this wealth brings not the need for confrontation, as all know this commodity could become a "currency" in and of itself, if needed.

The troubles we find today are troubles of a "paper currency nature" that brings to the forefront the need for low priced oil. Yes, you may extrapolate the order of confluence in this way; "paper currency created thru the creation of debt" then "always the continuation of more debt to expand business and commerce" then " the limits are reached for world trade to repay this paper debt" then "a further creation of debt for the creation of paper money with purpose only to save banks and governments" then "the need for raw commodities (oil and others) to be priced unfairly low for the continuation of business and debt payment"! Today, if oil was priced fairly, in real terms, the dollar/IMF currency structure would not stand.

The basic engine for Western commerce is run with energy, energy from oil! The "wealth of nations" is based on the continuation of business, for it is this commerce that
makes valuable the paper assets (currencies included) held by citizens. This is a common knowledge, little held by western thinkers. They say that it be the paper assets that give value for the purpose of trade. I say, a simple person does stand at the river edge and know from where the waters flow! If the current paper economy does destroy "the business of oil" then, this currency system will destroy itself. It does so today, as a low gold price in dollar terms does balance the value of reserves in ground, but the promise of good "future oil flow" is questioned if paid for in more debt. For as before, when this currency was expanded with "business as backing", today, the lack of alternatives forces the creation of dollars in the gamblers house! I will not hold the notes of a fool for the future of my country. I see our future with a currency from the "House of Europe" that will be used in payment for this future search for oil! You see, this "business of oil" it does continue, yes? Thank You

Goldfly: Hello!
Your question:
Who (besides Saudi Arabia- obviously) is collecting on the gold payments? I don't think we should look at these as payments. Because it is a free open market, anyone can
collect, that's true. But, most don't, not yet! If any large buyer began buying outright, the market would rocket. I think, much of the gold is contained in the form of paper
commitments. The actual gold still rests in the CB vaults. If it was ever officially signed over it would show up on the asset statements of the Euro CBs. (the answer to your "who is supplying gold) That's one of the reasons they don't want gold to rise yet, as the Euro is not available to offer as a repurchase vehicle.
This arrangement is most likely the main reason that the Euro will be a success, no matter what. Without a new reserve currency, the one major oil producer would
immediately reprice oil in terms of a small fraction of gold plus payment in ANY major currency. The ensuing run on gold would cause every world oil producer to join in on this
price set. Only fools would step back and watch their oil sold off for (at the then existing exchange rates) virtually nothing.

Virginian,
Welcome! Your observation of gold shows how different the market is today from the past. That's one of the reasons we cannot expect the past history of gold (from 1970s to
present) to be a guide for the future. Truly, that era was very good for an investment in gold and the business of gold mining. Today, gold should not be an investment. History
shows that stock equities (gold mining included) or any form of paper wealth do very poorly during massive currency destruction. I think, gold bullion should be purchased as a
currency only!
Yes, gold stocks will move up and down in a tradable fashion for the time being. However, when the real currency wars start, much of the current trading arena will close
from default. During these extreme times, FXC (foreign exchange controls) will no doubt, include gold as a currency alternative. Physical gold purchase, contrary to most analysis, will be encouraged in America as an alternate form of wealth (401-K or retirement savings) because it will redirect money from going into the Euro. It will, of course be at a much different dollar price from today!
I hope gold does not go up until the Euro arrives. To date it is still in control. But, the Asian (and China) problem have come onto the stage much more quickly than anticipated. I expect it will rise through $320 in a week or so, but $360+ would be a disaster. We shall
see. Thanks for the thoughts. FOA

My Thoughts!
Michael (USAGOLD),

I saw your Market report on 10-08-98 with the reprint of Reuters "Dollar could followFootsteps of emerging countries". Alfons Verplaetse (BIS) told it as he saw it. Isn't it strange how the perception of an alternative currency has moved so slowly for so long. Now every investor is trying to access the impact on their assets. We have never in modern history seen a move from one currency system to another. The rush to establish a Euro position will shock the financial system far more than the oil embargo ever did.
Because the majority of wealth is still held in dollar terms, the loss in dollar assets may prove to be The Event of the next 100 years! I think, with the support of oil producers, Europe may become an island of economic prosperity, even greater than the American experience. The next several years will prove the value of real assets for anyone outside the Euro arena. It will appear much to the typical American, looking in as it appears to the
typical Mexican looking across your Rio Grand border. Many analysis think this could never happen! The same was said of Russia, Korea, Asia and even Japan in the late 1980s.
A dynamic period lies before us! FOA

PH in LA , Hello!
The $360 question is a difficult one to explain. I'll try. If you remember, after the Gulf War, gold began a strange (not understood) drop through the first part of 1993. About mid to late 1993 a group out of Asia began buying gold, real gold. It may have been a legendary trader out of Hong Kong or some other group in China. It was thought that they had understood the implications and reasons for the falling dollar price of gold. Their
buying drove the price into a range of approximately $365 to $390 for several years. At one point this buying of physical and paper had leveraged them into a cornering of the
market to some extent! The offtake was incredible. This is where the political intrigue comes in that I am unsure of? This buying (and leveraging) threatened to unhinge the
delicate balance of valuing oil in dollars, through gold. Even though the buying was done with real money (paper not credit) and much of it was based in the hand over of HK to
China, if allowed to continue, it would have driven gold sky high. With the EMU still in trouble with no commitment to price oil in Euros, a run of gold could have evoked a
reprise of oil in gold terms. In early 1997, the BIS (the Euro group portion) came to some agreement about the Euro and oil. In return, the BIS smashed the Asian economy and
unleashed much of that gold. Few people grasp this, but I offer that if the BIS could take down Russia, a world nuclear superpower, Asia was no problem. It is at this point that we begin to understand the real power of a union of oil and the Euro (BIS).
To answer your question, a run in gold past $360 would mean this union has split and a firestorm of economic destruction was at the door. After all, it is oil that has backed the dollar these last many years, waiting for an alternative reserve!
PH, I cannot possibly begin to discuss this in one day, so I hope this helps. Thanks FOA

I must address something here. The book, "In The Footsteps" was written by Mr. Michael Kosares, not Another. I have seen only minor parts of it, sent to me by others. I
am also 95% sure Another has not seen it, but I cannot be sure. Michael has used his many years of experience to interpret the Thoughts! message and I am told it was done very well. As time marches on, no doubt world events will make it a worthy reference.
Your question of payment for oil, in what? I don't think that the exact day of Jan 01,1999 and the official start of the Euro will change all things. We will more likely see the
beginnings of a progression of events, moving the world economy away from US$ based settlement. A good many analysis have picked up on the Another line of reasoning and are
predicting a rise in gold for 1999. I don't think they understand what is before us as they are advising clients to hold US treasury bonds and gold stocks. That should prove to be a confounding combination for anyone looking for safety. In much the same way as investors invested in gold for a trade, then found that the markets did not move with
historic supply and demand features.
Even Pete (a poster here), may bet the farm on a Euro proposition. Pete, please, allow only ten or twenty percent of your acres of corn for gold, it will be enough!

turbohawg, Welcome!
I would like to build on Goldfly's and PH's posts.

Much of the oil produced today is high cost in dollar terms. Even now many producers make little profit. This fact is not lost to the middle eastern suppliers as they are able to pump today with large profits. True, they posture their loss of market share and show how they are going broke, but they have reserves that can supply twice the current daily
amount if needed!
To understand what is about to happen, one must see that in hard currency Euro terms, oil is going to drop in price (economic depression or not)! Yes, far below what the
marginal producers can supply for. They will indeed have a choice, sell oil in plunging US dollars, or not sell at all in Euro terms as it will be below their high dollar production cost! Much of the worlds inefficient goods production is a result of maintaining the high dollar production cost oil supply. This is retained for the purpose of creating a strategic oil supply for the benefit of American Dollar stature.
You see, the eastern producers always could supply the world, if only the world would pay in an honest currency! Falling oil prices in Euros will create a tremendous need for the world to sell goods to Europe to receive Euros. Oil purchased with Euros as a result of commerce and trade will drive the world economy in a way few envision.
America will find that they must trade with Europe as only oil purchased in Euros will allow for competitive pricing of goods and services. You will see a hyperinflation of the
dollar standing next to a full deflation of production costs in Euro/Gold terms. A new world indeed! FOA

Pete,
What is shown here is the blueprint or chart of intentions. The changing of a world currency system is a tremendous political event. I offer the course and bearing that was set. It will be the captains of state that must sail the ship. The winds and currents may blow us far from the plotted journey, but the port of call remains the same.

I will use your questions in parts to explain.
Your words: --------"On the one hand you say that the Asians were purchasing gold in amounts that were disrupting the price beyond what someone expected thereby the BIS
destroyed their economy so that they were forced to sell the gold they had been accumulating and to put a stop to the acceleration of price above $360/oz. On the other hand you have been stating that recently the price has been plunging below production costs and BIS reserve valuations by the actions of the iceberg(Banks, brokers, funds) use of derivatives. "
Pete, In the currency world everything moves on perceptions of how current events will impact future flows. The same was happening back then. The Euro Group had never
thought that Asia would become such consumers of gold. They had always brought throughout the years, but never in these amounts. Something had changed. The Euro CBs had wanted to bring gold into the $320 - $360 range and keep it there until the new currency arrived. Remember this was the range they brought it to by early 1993 (check your charts for clarity). In this range the dollar looked good (gold could be purchased in long term commitments) and most importantly, much of the world production was still online. Mine production was important as that (in theory anyway) was what fed the replacement of loaned out CB gold.
You had on one side Super rich Asians (including the Central Bank of China) buying gold because they didn't want to be caught in a Euro world holding Dollars. On the other
side we found oil money that were waiting for a clarification of Euro policy, regarding gold. Any rise above $360 (prior to Euro launch) was seen as a loss of control that would create an every man for himself atmosphere.
That was then, a period from mid 1993 to late 1996. In early 1997 the Euro CBs attempted to lower gold and it touched off a buying spree that was unheard of! The lower
it was sent the greater the buying. Even LBMA had to openly show what was happening. Eventually, the BIS worked with China to control Asia by including them in on the Euro sphere. China had / has little use for it's Asian neighbors and the American Political / Dollar influence on the region. Besides, all of Asia was long sense hooked on a US trading partnership. You remember the APEC conference in Seattle. The American economy had "bet the farm" on the Pacific rim and turned a cold shoulder to Europe. Jump to the present and we witness the "Master Plan", as Another calls it. The BIS smashed Japan and it's neighbors and has left them holding a ship load of Dollar assets only months before a Euro launch!
That sector of the competition is done for. Now all that remains is to control the traders and speculators that have jumped onto the "Yen carry / Gold carry trade in the mistaken notion that gold is about be phased out of international finance. Well, you can see the results. They forced Mr. Greenspan's hand into crushing these players. I can tell you he never, ever wanted to lower rates as a dollar crush will be the result (it has started)!
I have jumped around a lot here, but I think you see why the influences on gold creates an atmosphere of confusion regarding "intent". Actually, some other things have happened in the last few days that will come out soon. I hope Another will lead the way on this in that I may commit on them. It's extremely interesting. Thanks Pete, I will be watching and posting here. FOA

Secret deal on $US-yen dive ???
David Linkley,
The drop in the dollar against the Yen does make one wonder what happened? We had almost every Major hedge fund in the world positioning into derivatives trades that would benefit from a rise in US rates and a further fall in the Yen. Billions (some say trillions) placed on bets that used low cost ( almost free?) gold and / or low cost (almost
free?) Yen to raise the gambling money. Speculation in the American markets had reached a level equal to the Japan bubble and the Fed lowers rates?? Yet the Yen carries rates of .25% +/- with it's banks going under and every investor worldwide runs into this currency in TWO DAYS to drive it up???
It makes one think that a door needed to be shut very fast so as not to let something out?? Well, the somethings are now locked in nice and tight with a lot of wealth needing to change hands to close the bets made with that, free money! You know, LTCM was a well connected group that many others emulated for the very reason that they were, well connected. Now, it first appeared that these gentlemen were reprimanded with lower US rates because they acted so boldly. In some quiet circles it is still seen this way. But the speed of the event makes me think that the Hedge funds positions were correct as was the information they acted on. Was some leverage applied to Mr. Greenspan and Mr.Yen to
force a quick resolution of their problem? Perhaps a problem of larger scope and importance was seen over the horizon?
This I do know. To cover the open gold positions will require far more than simple option strategies as loss hedges! We may enter a pricing storm for gold that will see it's value literally all over the map! The possibility of the large up and down moves may wreck many portfolios that have strayed from the simple action of buying plain physical bullion, without leverage. I offer this as a fair consideration for the simple investor / saver. We shall see. FOA

Note: This is part of an article about Russian imports. It also has a bit about the new gold coin. I place it here as a thought about how gold can take the place of other metals (silver) as money. The new Russian coin will have a gold content of about $6.00 US. As we see here they did not use silver for there was no need to do so. Gold can be placed into coins in amounts of a few cents US if needed for small exchange. Food for thought?

Russian imports plunge
Financial crisis means consumers can't afford most imported goods!
Leslie Shepherd - Associated Press

(partial reprint)

"The Kommersant business newspaper said Friday it had learned one proposal under consideration: minting a gold coin to raise money to pay overdue wages and pensions, as well as debts on government bonds.
Kommersant said 22 tons of the Central Bank's 550 tons of gold reserves would be used to raise 5 billion rubles, or about $316 million.
The coins would have a face value of 1,000 rubles, or about $63, and 5,000 rubles. But they would contain only 10 rubles (63 cents) and 100 rubles($6.30) worth of gold respectively, the newspaper said."

Gas producers pin hope on India and China

Gulf gas producers have seen their traditional markets eroded by economic turmoil in Asia and hopes for a recovery in the next decade are pinned on India and China. Asia was until last year seen as the major market for Gulf liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers like Qatar and Oman. But most Asian clients have since been hit by economic crises that have stalled or even reversed growth.
Expectations that demand for gas from these markets would absorb increased output from Gulf states have not materialised, said analysts at a Middle East gas summit which opened in Abu Dhabi yesterday.
"The industry has turned upside down as the effect of Asia's economic and financial crisis have filtered through the energy sector ... "The list of potential new buyers is now effectively reduced to two: India and China," said Chris Holmes, senior downstream and gas consultant
with Gaffney, Cline and Associates' office in Singapore. South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines have all experienced slowdowns in demand that range from slight growth in the case of Taiwan to negative
demand for South Korea. Middle East gas producers, which account for a third of the world's proven natural gas reserves, are also facing stiff competition from Asian producers like Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia.
"Demand growth in traditional LNG has all but stalled and exploitation of new markets has been painfully slow ... The industry faces a somewhat uncertain future," Holmes said.
Amid the gloom, Korea in particular is of concern to Gulf LNG producers.
Oman has agreed to supply Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) with 4.1 million tonnes a year (mty) for 25 years from 2000, while Qatar's Rasgas has a 4.8 mty sales commitment to Kogas from 1999. But further deals may be a long way off. Korean LNG imports have risen from 1.7 mty in 1987 to 11.6 mty in 1997 and some were predicting a further growth to 30 mty by 2010. – AFP

Tokyo profit-takers ignore bank rescue

by LACHLAN COLQUHOUN in Hong Kong

MORE progress on Japan's bank rescue plan went
largely unnoticed by investors today as they took
profits after yesterday's strong rally among Tokyo
stocks.

An announcement from Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa that a new bank recapitalisation Bill
would inject 43 trillion yen into weak but viable
banks, in addition to the 17 trillion yen already
planned to protect depositors, kept the bank
rescue on track, but the fragility of the market was
emphasised by the profit taking.

Having seemingly won Opposition support to inject
public funds into ailing banks, leading figures from
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said the
government is now pondering injecting money into
healthy banks.

On the market, firmer bank shares could not stop
the benchmark Nikkei from dipping around 2% in
the morning, but although the losses were pared
the index was still in negative territory, falling 312
points, or 2.3%, to stand at 13,243. The index
spiked more than 5% yesterday in one of the best
days' trading this year.

Some brokers attributed the profit taking to
investors raising cash to fund shares in the £10
billion float of mobile phones operator DoCoMo,
which makes its debut on 22 October. Among
active stocks, shares in Daiwa House fell around
2% after the company said it expected to post a 10
billion yen first-half loss, compared with a 14 billion
yen profit last year. Canon made sharp gains,
adding 5% on reports it had won a new printer
contract with Hewlett-Packard. Exporting blue
chips, such as entertainment giant Sony, were
clipped back after yesterday's gains.

In Hong Kong early gains were erased by profit
taking after a four-day rally saw the Hang Seng
index breach the 9000-points level yesterday for
the first time in months. Easier local interest rates
and Wall Street's resilience helped sentiment at the
outset, but nervousness over the poor economic
outlook capped any continuation of the rally. By the
mid-session break, the Hang Seng had fallen 1%,
or 89 points, to 8944.

Market leader HSBC held on to its gains, however,
staying unchanged at HK$156.50, while the rally on
property counters ran out of momentum. In
company news, conglomerate First Pacific denied
media reports it was pondering the sale of its
banking subsidiary FPB Banking.

Elsewhere, markets moved in a narrow range with
a lack of direction from Japan and Hong Kong. In
Seoul, the Kospi added just over a point to 353,
with bank counters Korea First and Seoulbank
going limit-up, or 8% higher, after the government
said it would buy most of the banks' bad debts. In a
sombre warning, credit rating agency Moody's
described the country's bank system as "technically
insolvent". Shares gained ground in Taiwan, the
Composite adding 50 to 6971 on the back of
firmer hi-tech shares on the US Nasdaq market.

Thailand's SET was barely a point firmer at 291,
while Jakarta's Composite was virtually unchanged
at 308. Singapore's Straits Times was 0.7%, or
eight, down at 1009, while Malaysia's Composite
fell three to 386.

Reassuring comments about financial caution from
News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch at the company's
annual meeting today saw the shares put on 1.3%
in Australia. The All Ordinaries edged 12 points
lower to 2488.

Russian losses hit Frenchbank jobs in London

Boris Yeltsin has joined the list of those including
Robert Maxwell, the Italian fraudster Giancarlo
Paretti and two shareholders in the ill-fated
Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, who
have caused France's Credit Lyonnais to lose
money by the truckload.

The state-owned bank has confirmed that its
Central and East European fixed-income desk in
London has been shut down, with the loss of
around 30 jobs. A spokesman would not deny
reports that this was linked to losses on Russian
GKOs, which collapsed in value when Moscow
defaulted.

Previously, Credit Lyonnais chairman Jean
Peyrelevade has said that provisions of Ffr4.2
billion (£450 million) for the first half were
due to the Russian and Asian crises, and that
apart from GKOs, the bank held practically no
emerging market debt securities.

Credit Lyonnais representatives head the French
delegation negotiating with Russia over GKO
restructuring, usually a sign that a bank has a great
deal at stake in the talks.

Credit Lyonnais would not comment on whether
further redundancies were planned in London.

The French government won a special ex-emption
from Brussels subsidy rules to allow it to prop up
the bank with a £13 billion rescue package. The
quid pro quo was that the bank would be almost
en-tirely privatised less than a year from now.
However, that timetable now looks hard to meet.

My Thoughts!
USAGOLD,
I read Mr. Turk's article posted on your The Gilded Opinion page. It is a fine work of analysis of the gold market. If I may, a point of discussion can be brought up by viewing his thoughts from a different perspective.
Michael, from your earlier post this was pulled:
"In the course of our conversation the subject of LTCM's gold short position came up and he said in his understated, scholarly way that if LTCM's 400 ton loan position were
defaulted on that the central bank or banks which made the loan would have to consider the loan "a sale into the market" since they are unlikely to get their gold back. I asked Mr. Turk the same question I asked ANOTHER a while back. "If you are a central banker lending gold, what do you take as collateral (since gold is the ultimate collateral, all other collateral is inferior.)" Turk answered. "You take nothing. It is an unsecured loan."

"You take nothing. It is an unsecured loan." ! With this statement in mind, I begin.

As Mr. James Turk stated, " like big tail-fins on 1950's Cadillacs. An era has passed"!
Yes, I agree entirely. We now swiftly come to the conclusion of an era that has brought gold into the monetary forefront as never before. Gold has been fought over, pushed, shoved and manipulated in the 90s the same way as most major currencies. The only items missing during this quiet war was the an extreme increase in value that the investing public
must have to validate that gold is in use! As often quoted, "If the price isn't rising, no one must want it or need it". Truly a paradox of thinking in our time.
The facts, as presented by the World Gold Council (WGC) show that in 1997 only 406 tonnes of gold were actually sold from the vaults of the world Central Banks. This amounts to only 1% of all the gold reserves held in reserve. It is very important to note that the major countries that sold gold (Canada, Belgium, Holland, Portugal and a few others) made up the majority of this 1% reduction, if not all of it! They also are the source of most of the 5% of the Central Bank reduction in holdings during the last 10 (ten)Years!
To better place that last sentence in correlation with the current gold lease / lending market is to grasp that these banks, Canada, Holland and the lot, did actually sell their gold, not lend it. They don't want it back! Using this line of reasoning, then, if these countries made up the bulk of gold sales that represented the total reduction in Central Bank reserves, what gold was sold that represented the lease / lend deals?
Much of the conjecture amongst analysis in banking circles seems to center around one major point. A point that without acceptance, destroys the entire argument that gold
leasing sales are what have destroyed the market. That point is: "of the gold still held in the Central Bank vaults and carried on the books as reserve assets, some it was has sold
off and replaced with leasing paper"! Please correct me, but a bank may mobilize any asset for return and list it that way on the balance sheet. However, to list Physical Gold, that is not a paper asset, as present when it is not is "Fraud"! To do this on a scale that the present gold leasing market suggest is happening, would amount to a gross violation of BIS accounting standards. To view this in a better light I will use a phrase that Another has posted here:
"a simple person does stand at the river edge and know from where the waters flow".
To continue: The central purpose behind the Yen Carry trade and the Gold Carry trade is to place liquidity into the world financial structure. This action was made
necessary by the failure of the US dollar to function any further as a money creation vehicle. In these last days of the dollar, worldwide debt as denominated in dollars has
ceased to expand and is indeed contracting. This is a natural event that occurs in the latter time cycle of un-backed paper currencies. This contraction was expected to complete the fiat money cycle back in the late 1980s. It has been the Central Banks, lead by the BIS that created ingenious ways to expand liquidity until another currency system could be introduced. In these 1990s, the Yen / Gold Carry was one of those ways.
Much of the Gold lending dealings is more a function of paper contracts than actual gold sales. Using my "water flow" point above, if that much gold was actually sold out
into the industry, we would have seen major reductions from the gold asset side of the Central Banks. The true purpose of the leasing (not all of it , just most of it) was to create cheap money that could flow into other aspects of the economy and help perpetuate a boom, worldwide. As seen in the LTCM debacle, a little money in the right hands can be
multiplied into billions of new found liquidity. Now consider that some have stated that the gold loan contracts amount to 8,000 tonnes or more! Another has said that they, if actually closed out as gold deliveries would amount to over 14,000 tonnes! Suddenly we see where the money has come from to gun the world asset markets. A market of
trillions!
So, why are they called gold loans if the gold isn't used? The point is the gold is used. It is the final commitment or backup if the deals fail. When a hedge fund (or mine) cannot repay the "cash equivalent" of the gold or "the gold itself", then the Central Bank, as the
originator of the deal must deliver Real Gold or PAY IN A HARD CURRENCY!
One of the things that Another has been guiding us to for over a year is that the current gold deals amount to an all out corner on the CB gold supply. The major people that are on the other side of these Gold Loans (lets call them what they really are: currency loans on a worldwide scope that is backed, ultimately with much of the CB gold) will call for this gold that was already paid for over many years! The intent of the Euro Group CBs was to have these loans self liquidate in a normal fashion. If they did not them they would pay the equivalent of the gold owed in Euros! A function, in actually, of issuing Euros for
already sold gold! Furthering a pending proposition between the ECB and it's EMCBs.
Now, my friends, you understand why a Euro price for gold of $6,000+ (current rate), if in effect a year or so after that currency debuts will create a reserve currency of
tremendious debth and holdings worldwide. It will be a welcome development. With the dollar falling from reserve status and the total default of dollar based gold contracts,
physical gold will be an "investment for a lifetime" as Another has said! The demand for gold as a currency reserve by governments and as a currency alternative by citizens, will amount to more metal than exists.

I credit Another with most of this input. It is his wish that these thoughts be discussed by all, for all to see.
Thanks FOA

Euro use to gain?

Euro signals new life in bond market

by ANTONIA FEUCHTWANGER

With the birth of the single currency less
than three months away, the
euro-denominated Eurobond market is
showing signs of activity after the
summer's turmoil interrupted its
expansion.

Investor presentations begin today in Paris for
Mediocredito Centrale, the development bank of
Italy, which plans a debut issue in euro, while
Daiwa Securities has taken advantage of an
apparent vogue for the euro in Japan.

Daiwa's 100 million euro bond, denominated in the
ecu basket currency until one-for-one conversion to
euro on 1 January, was for the Kingdom of
Denmark. It was announced earlier this week but
according to the International Insider service was
sold by Daiwa the previous week. Daiwa, which
has just refocused its London operations mainly on
Japan-related activities, underwrote and sold the
entire deal itself.

Carol Hird, syndicate manager at Paribas, which
has a strong presence in euro Eurobonds,
commented: "Some Japanese institutions are very
concerned about how to account for the legacy
currencies (such as the French franc and
Deutschmark which are joining the euro). They
would like to go straight to the euro."

She added: "A lot of reports about the euro have
got through to savers on the street in Japan, who
are now very interested. At the beginning of this
year the market for ecu/euro bonds was very small
but it has grown fast." The yen's bounce back last
week has helped make the euro relatively cheap.
Warburg Dillon Read this week increased its 100
million euro issue for America's GECC to 200
million while the bank is currently making
presentations for a 175 million euro issue for
Generalitat de Catalunya, a Spanish regional
authority.

Paribas itself is advising Mediocredito Centrale on
its still unformed plans to issue bonds in Europe's
new single currency. The Italian bank is effectively
State-guaranteed but its rating is A1-/A. In most
European countries, according to Paribas, its debt
is zero-weighted for capital adequacy purposes,
which is attractive for bank investors. The bonds
could be fixed or floating rate. Mediocredito lends
to small businessses and development projects,
sometimes subsidising other banks' loans to
growing companies. It has a 41% stake in Sicily's
largest bank, which has depressed its rating thanks
to worries about credit quality in a relatively poor
part of Italy.

Items.
ALL:
I must apologize for the poor placement of some wording in my post MSG: 556. My time was in short supply.
------------------------------------------------------------
Also: Someone (perhaps PH in LA) asked about Mr. M. A. Armstrong's various reports and my thoughts on them. I think we will see the many of the world economies that base
their future on a trading relationship with the USA fall into a major depression. Perhaps much as MA suggests?? As for his views on gold and the Euro:
I add that the nations that have created this new currency have been around far longer than the thoughts of any analysis. The gold market will also outlive the negative
predictions put forth by some.
The latest Oct. 9th work offered by MA has this statement: "The Euro has effectively been wiped off the face of the earth." I direct you to my last news post of Msg #556. If the Euro is wiped out then someone did not tell Japan!
Mr. Dallas Guns Msg #560:
You write: " Why is this the only place were this theory is being discussed? Wouldn't many more know the same as you and another?"
Dallas, in the 1970s few thought that gold would go to $800+ US and it was discussed openly by how many? Even less saw oil at $40+US or a Dow of 8,000+. The history of
world major events are filled with actions that were impossible to foresee, yet some record was always found of people that did not discuss the event but did anticipate and prepare for it. Today we see the birth of a new currency that was thought to be dead (and openly discussed as finished) yet somewhere, somehow a very large group of people were working diligently to create it. Don't assume
that your media and elected officials will always keep the public informed of impending events. Especially if those events could undermine their power.
You write: "If you are as sure as you say, why not bet the farm"?
I have learned a great deal about conservative living. And I learned it from some world class wealthy people. It was put to me this way:
"If you have a nature to bet the farm and you win, the winning will not change your basic negative character of farm betting. In time, you will bet all of it again! Conversely, if you do very well with an appropriate investment decision (with your family in mind), the
winning will reinforce a positive character of prudent wealth building. This you will carry for all your days."
Dallas, trading some of your currency (yen? mark? dollars?) for another currency (gold)is not investing! It is the prudent use of playing the history of gold against the history of paper money. It has worked for others for thousands of years and will work for you.
Thanks for the consideration. May we will continue this as time allows? FOA

Tyler Rose (10/14/98; 10:17:22MDT - Msg ID:568)
Tyler Rose,
To answer your question we must travel a distance. -------------------------------------------------------
Some of the confusion with gold loans in general stems from the fact that there are thousands of them. They exist in every shape and fashion. The terms Gold Loan or Gold
Lease are generic. Just as when we speak of an automobile in public, it is of little use without knowing the make and model. The term Car covers a broad means of transportation.
Some gold deals are real in that the gold is sold and transported to a new owner. The borrower must literally pay back gold to the lender. However, as you may know, a
contract between parties can be written in any matter that is agreeable. In a gold deal, a lender may ask to be paid back in the cash equivalent of gold in any specified currency.---------------------------------------------
Some deals do not even involve central banks, as they are written by private holders of gold. In these transactions, currency profit may not be the purpose. My point is only to
show that there are many variables. ---------------------
Another has written before of the absurdity of Central Banks lending gold at a few percent. They stand on the roof tops to proclaim how smart they are to receive a return on
an otherwise sterile investment. Yet, any fool can see that it is not a true business transaction in the usual sense. The point of my post was to show that by using official
statistic on Central Bank gold holdings, the majority of the time they have not sold the gold involved in lending deals. If it was sold, it would have been removed or the title to it transferred. Therefore, the lending deals are only currency loans denominated in gold. The money actually generated in these deals is created by the Bullion Bank or another entity has supplied it. In this matter the CBs have used their gold as leverage many times over to create a massive new money supply. In reality, if the Hedge Fund / Leverage Community ever started to fall apart, a huge portion of the CB gold would be termed "deliverable"
from default. -----------------------------------------
Tyler, you know and I know that the world gold market would be shut down long before they ever, ever deliver that much gold. What will happen is that much of the current financial leverage, that is heading into it's last days, will be covered by delivering Euros as partial payment. When gold begins trading again at a new value (of perhaps
$6,000 US present buying power) in Euros, it will be easy for some of the defaulted holders of loans (oil and others) to be made whole in currency. With this in mind, some
entities with huge natural resource reserves have used them as collateral to originate the money used in a 1% CB gold loan. It is almost like selling oil for gold, don't you think?
With a gold valuation that high, the Euro will become The Hard Currency for the 21st century.
Now, to your question: A gold loan by a Central Bank to a "Financial Operator" (hedge fund and others) in indeed an unsecured loan! They have loaned their gold as "backing for
the deal" and must supply it if a default occurs. If they have loaned it to a Mine entity, they will have a right to claim the mine assets in a default. Therefore, a mine loan is not unsecured. Not a pleasant thought for the holders of gold stocks during a worldwide currency crisis!
Much more to it than this. I hope others will write their thoughts on the oil / gold /leasing markets. There is a lot of room and tremendous tolerance for diverse views.

Bottom$,
Hello! ------------------------------------------
Do you remember when gold jumped from $40+ to $800+ in a decade or so? Prior to that the world monetary authorities had enough gold in relation to circulating currencies that they could control it's price by actually selling it into the market. (why they didn't just revalue it's price to $1,000+ and continue on is another story we will cover
here some day)(it covers why they took the dollar off the gold standard to raise the price of oil). When they stopped selling gold's price jumped. Today, they don't have that much gold in relation to the incredible amount of money and leverage out there. In fact, as I just discussed with Tyler Rose, instead of selling they are using it to build onto the money supply. Few understand that the price of gold is dropping during this era for
several reasons. Besides being used to offer gold cheaply in dollar terms. it is being used to make the dollar strong by creating liquidity. A function the dollar stopped performing
five or six years ago. They can never sell gold into the market again as a means of controlling the price the way they did in the 70s. --------------------------
Another sent in a fine piece once explaining how the the currency inflation in dollars was already present. More than enough to drive gold sky high. Just because the goods
prices don't reflect currency printing doesn't mean it isn't already present. He said something to the effect, " your chickens have already rousted, only now you find they
have come home"! When the dollar is removed from reserve status, the American economy with all it's deficit problems will be subject to all the troubles other nations now
have. In this atmosphere gold will increase in real term value many times over. You may also add any amount to that figure for future price inflation. Thanks FOA

Please read my post to Tyler Rose and Bottom$. It may cover some of the things you bring up. I think, the term hard currency has been convoluted during this era of fiat
currencies. You are right in that many refer to any currency as hard if it can be traded in the open market. In the future the Euro / Dollar conversion rate may be so far from
today's reality that trying to price it now is out of the question. You mentioned in another post that real assets will always be worth something, somewhere. True for the USA but they have so much currency represented worldwide as debt that even without the adverse effects of Foreign Exchange Controls, evaluating real assets in dollars will be, at best a computer's job.

Do you own ABX? I remember when they were nothing back in the 80s. Then they and NEM started the revolution of gold loans! In 1995 or so everybody loved ABX as they were hedged. You were protected if the gold price dropped, so they thought. Today, many investors use the notion that Barrick has fallen less than others as a good reason for
them to have bought the stock. Nice thoughts but that was not the original premise for buying it. ------------------------------------------------------------
Here we have the top gold mining company in the USA, with an operating cost at rock bottom in some of their holdings and hedged for years with high priced gold. All of this
and it's stock falls! What is going to happen to the regular mines when the gold price goes up only a few hundred dollars before the market is shut down and a full scale currency war
destroys all equity markets? Sure, OTC gold may trade, but will these mines be selling gold out into the public when the governments are shutting down for lack of treasury
funding? BMAC, I don't think brokers sell these securities as investments in the context of future times. Mines are sold today as regular business ventures with a view that the past 20 years offers a framework for the future. The true facts are that even the last 60 years doesn't offer a historical example for the gold finding business. It's present structure is but a new niche in an evolving financial landscape. A landscape that may cascade onto the
dreams of many mine investors that thought they were gold investors.
Having said all of this gold stocks will, no doubt go up 600% next week. My loss Bmacd, hopefully not yours! Thanks FOA

Tyler Rose,
The "3rd party Who" that you refer to is indeed the billion marks question! Ever notice how all of the gold sales often state who sold the gold. The public statement deliberately poses the sell side of the equation because the seller can be known. If they printed it as a gold buy, then the buyer would be listed and the public left in the dark about the seller.------------------------------------
They do the same thing with the gold lending markets. -------Think about it.-------When the Dutch sell gold, we know it because their vaults have less gold to be reported. But when they lease gold, nothing ever leaves the vault?? Example: We know that in a gold lending deal, say, $300 million dollars are created and given to someone to play with. Party #1. We know that a Bullion Bank obtained $300m but don't know where? If no CB vault had $300m in gold (one million ounces) removed then the money didn't come from a
gold sale. Now the contract can still be called a gold loan because it requires one million ounces of gold to be repaid. It didn't require that one million ounces be sold to create the money! Now, don't you think that a bank , operating in a fractional reserve environment, would be willing to create capitol by holding any 3rd parties collateral (in this case even dirt would due) for 1/2% to 1% plus fees and no risk whatsoever? You see, the CB gold only backs the deal. It's not sold in the event of default, it's delivered! Using fractional reserve banking, I wonder how many loans could be made with the same million ounces of gold? As to who are the 3rd party investors that helping to expand liquidity by really buying gold with in-ground reserves at a cheap price? When the dollar starts to come off the oil reserve standard, we will all find out. I have to go now. Be back to read the
thoughts of others.

Japanese restructuring 'crucial to end Southeast Asian turmoil'
-------------------------------------------------------
MANAMA: The Japanese economy is likely to remain sluggish during the next year, although prospects of recovery look good after that, according to a leading Japanese economist.

The Asian financial crisis will widen the US trade deficit, causing lower growth over the next two years, said economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Kazuteru Tanaka.

He was the speaker yesterday at a luncheon-talk organised by the Bankers Society of Bahrain.

The event was held at the Regency Inter-Continental Hotel.

"Most of the Asian countries have been struggling very hard to regain a growth path," said Mr Tanaka.

"This will depend on how quickly Japan is able to achieve a growth path and
Japanese recovery depends on stimulation of domestic de-mand."

However, the Japanese economy continues to remain sluggish, with
Government projections at a negative gro-wth rate of 1.8 per cent for the
current fiscal year, ending March 1999.

This would mean two consecutive years of negative growth, with the previous
fiscal year recording a negative growth of 0.7pc.

"It is apparent that the Japanese economy is still in recession," said Mr
Tanaka.

"The sentiment of consumers and corporates is defensive yet, so it is really
the government's responsibility to change that sentiment.

"This is not going to be easy because of two big burdens in the form of the
bad debt problem with the banking industry and the need for restructuring
industry, both of which are connected very closely."

Accumulated bad debts have eroded assets of individual banks and, despite
their setting aside 40 trillion yen to combat this, the economy remains
sluggish.

However, the current Japanese government had brought in new rules and
regulations to tackle systemic problems and these should bear result in the
future, said Mr Tanaka.

The policies, supported by continued fiscal help from the government could
mean a return to positive growth after the next fiscal year.

However, Japan would not need to go into the market to finance the banking
industry's problems.

"We are the biggest net asset holding country in the world, with $1 trillion in
assets," said Mr Tanaka.

"Our GDP totals $4 trillion a year, second only to the US which is $8 trillion."

On the effect of the Asian crisis on the world economy, Mr Tanaka said the
US economy would see lower growth rates for the next two years.

"Until recently, the US economy was the anchor of the world economy," he
said.

"The US has enjoyed several years of positive growth with low inflation, better
corporate profits and full employment.

"But something is changing and the US economy could have a soft landing."

The European economies would remain stable, despite the German exposure
to the Russian crisis.

S African gold empire in £6bn London move
---------------------------------------------------

by PATRICK HOSKING

THE sprawling mining empire of South Africa's
super-rich Oppenheimer family is moving to the
London stock market with a planned £6 billion
listing early next year.

In a painful blow for the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange and a coup for London, Anglo American
Corporation said today it was taking over its sister
company Minorco and listing the combined group
in London, where it will immediately enter the
exclusive FT-SE 100 club of blue-chip companies.

Anglo American plc, as it will be called, is also
moving its head office from Johannesburg to
London.

It will be a mining colossus - the biggest producer
of gold in the world and a major force in diamonds,
platinum and coal, as well as holding a 21% stake
in FirstRand, South Africa's largest banking group.

In a dramatic bid to simplify its cat's cradle of
cross-shareholdings, AAC said it was taking
operational control of a host of subsidiaries where
it has only minority control, buying assets from
another Oppenheimer vehicle, the De Beers
diamonds business. The restructuring goes much
further than anticipated and gives the new AA full
access to the international capital markets as well
as the prospect of a flood of new shareholders,
who until now have shunned it as a South African
company.

"It's a huge step away from the old conglomerate
thinking," said one adviser on the deals.

AAC, which has been hit by the savage downturn in
the commodities market, said it hoped the deal
would narrow the discount to net asset value at
which its shares trade. However, in early trading in
Johannesburg, AAC shares were marked down
1.5% to 194 rand.

Under a scheme of arrangement, AAC
shareholders will be offered one new AA share for
every AAC share they own.

Shareholders in Minorco, the Luxembourg-based
AAC subsidiary which owns non-African mining
assets and industrial businesses, will be offered
one new AA share for every two Minorco shares.
There is also a cash alternative of $16 a share,
which compares with a price of around $13 before
the bid was tabled.

The Oppenheimer family, which owns 8% of AAC
and a controlling interest in De Beers, supports the
restructuring.

Cazenove and Warburg Dillon Read are advising
on the London listing and restructuring, while
Morgan Stanley is providing advice to the
independent directors of Minorco.

Although its primary listing will be in London, AA
will have secondary listings in Johannesburg and
other markets.

Many of its largest businesses will continue to be
run out of South Africa, but main board functions
will take place in London.

Advisers to AAC, which is chaired by Julian Ogilvie
Thompson, distanced the deal from the move to
London of another South African miner, Billiton,
whose share price has halved in the past year.
They stressed that unlike Billiton, AAC was raising
no new fresh capital."

"Dramatic political change in South Africa, together
with an easing of controls on capital, has led to this
major step in bringing together the assets and
resources of AAC and Minorco," the two
companies said.

Among the side deals, AAC is acquiring the 43%
of Amcoal it does not already own and is tabling an
offer for the 48% of industrial holding company
Amic it does not already own.

NOTE: This is old news but in light of the Hedge Fund problems I ask; "if these people start buying gold, how in the world will anyone else be able to cover at today's prices"?
-------------------------------------------------------
Liu Shanen, vice director of the
Gold Economic Development and Research
Institute of the State Metallurgical Industry Bureau,
recommended that the People's Republic should
increase its gold reserves from the current level of
397 tonnes or 3% of total foreign exchange
reserves of $140.5 billion to between 1,000 and
1,500 tonnes, between 6% and 8% of external
reserves, "to prevent financial risk." The reasoning
behind this recommendation is apparently the
belief that China should cut its holdings of
dollar-denominated foreign reserves to guard
against a possible fall in the dollar on the
introduction of the Euro, the single European
currency, at the beginning of next year. China
currently holds about 60% of its external reserves
in US dollar-denominated assets, including about
$60 billion in US Treasury bonds. "Compared with
cash, gold is stable and safe," Liu Shanen said.
He also recommended that the Chinese
government should ease controls on buying and
selling by individuals in a bid to boost what he
described as "non-governmental" reserves. Liu
Shanen pointed out that China ranks third in
global consumption of gold and fifth in mine
production, but only twelfth in terms of its official
reserves in gold.

Does the buck stop here?
A falling dollar signals new danger
for the U.S. economy

BY PHILLIP J. LONGMAN AND JACK EGAN

Whether you were a middle-class investor trying to
preserve the value of your 401(k) or the world's most
powerful central banker trying to forestall global
depression, reading the financial pages last week
was often a disorienting experience. "It's probably
wise to put your newspapers in your in-box and
leave them there for about a week," Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
suggested in a speech to a group of business
economists.

Yet Greenspan could hardly fault the press for the
worried headlines he himself was helping to write. In
the very same speech, he warned: "We are clearly
facing a set of forces that should dampen demand
to an unknown extent in the months ahead. We do
not know how far it will go or how much it will affect
consumer spending. It's a time for monetary policy
to be especially alert."

In times past, even a hint of pessimism from
Greenspan has often bolstered financial markets,
as investors surmised that a gloomy Fed chairman
would surely want to lower interest rates to
stimulate the economy. But adding to last week's
confusing headlines, this time Greenspan's gloom
created nothing but more gloom, as investors
focused on mysterious new forces that seem to be
undermining all conventional wisdom about how the
global economy works.

The yen also rises. The most dramatic case was
the news out of Japan. For more than a year, the
consensus view has been that the main culprit in
the worsening Asian crisis is Japan's banking
sector. In recent weeks, fears about the contagious
effects of Japan's banking mess became so acute
that American Embassy officials in Tokyo
characterized the problem as a national-security
threat to the United States.

Then last Wednesday, Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party submitted long-awaited bills that
would provide 10 trillion yen ($85.5 billion) to
recapitalize the country's banks. The proposed
bailout would be hard on Japanese taxpayers, but
it's just what the doctor ordered. The Japanese
stock market skyrocketed 6 percent, and the value
of the yen appreciated by a stunning 17 percent
against the dollar. But within a day this tonic would
create weird and debilitating side effects on the
world economy's tattered nervous system.

It turns out the hedge fund boys, those secretive
tycoons of the new economic order whose bets on
currency fluctuations increasingly determine the
fate of nations, have been wagering big time on an
ever weaker yen, which until last week seemed like
a no-lose proposition. The idea was to borrow yen
at low interest rates (less than 1 percent) in Japan,
convert them into dollars, and then lend the
proceeds out at higher interest rates elsewhere. So
long as the Japanese economy kept faltering and
the yen kept falling, these "yen carry" deals were
immensely profitable, since the loans could be
repaid with ever cheaper yen. But when the yen
started to strengthen on the supposedly good news
that Japan was finally getting on top of its banking
crisis, these highly leveraged deals began to
unwind, creating widespread panic.

A bad bond bet? It remains to be seen whether
the sudden fall in the value of the dollar against the
yen will be enough to cause a hedge fund or two to
collapse the way Long-Term Capital Management
nearly did two weeks ago. Julian Robertson's Tiger
Management, which has one of the biggest bets
against Japan, has lost about $1.8 billion, or 9.2
percent of its value, so far this month. Meanwhile,
many banks and even some industrial companies
are vulnerable as a result of their own yen carry
deals. And because of the size of all these lost
wagers, even unsuspecting homebuyers and
conservative investors in Treasury bills will soon be
feeling the aftershocks.

Last week, long-term U.S. Treasury bonds started
to plunge in price as their yields climbed back to
over 5 percent from recent lows of around 4.69
percent. The weakening dollar was a major reason.
Until recently, the Japanese in particular had been
huge buyers of U.S. Treasury notes, and a good
thing, too: With the U.S. savings rate now a
microscopic 0.2 percent, the American economy
desperately needs such capital from abroad. But as
the dollar weakens against the yen, U.S. financial
assets suddenly are worth a lot less in yen and
therefore far less attractive to Japanese investors.

Before, the greatest threat posed to the United
States by the Asian crisis was thought to be lost
exports; now it's clear that the agent of contagion
can come directly through the world's deeply
intertwined financial system. Last week, the U.S.
dollar also reached a 21-month low against the
German mark. The modest drop in short-term U.S.
interest rates announced by the Fed on September
29 and the expectation that further reductions are
coming were the main reasons for the greenback's
decline. Lower U.S. interest rates tend to reduce
the appeal of U.S. bonds to foreigners, who are able
to earn higher returns elsewhere.

This reality highlights another assault to the
conventional wisdom that occurred last week. The
more volatile world markets have become, the
louder the cry has been for the Fed to cut
short-term interest rates to keep the U.S. economy
humming along. Yet a new dynamic now seems to
be appearing whereby a cut in short-term interest
rates, to the extent it leads to expectations of a
weakening dollar and a corresponding fall-off in
foreign investment, creates higher long-term interest
rates.

Cash is king. Reinforcing this trend was a huge
increase in risk aversion among investors.
Suddenly, even long-term Treasury notes no longer
seem a safe enough investment, and more and
more investors are moving into short-term notes or
even cash. "This wasn't just a flight but a fright into
cash," declares John Krey, senior currency analyst
for Standard & Poor's MMS unit. According to
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter economist Stephen
Roach, "Lenders across the board are risk averse,
more so than anytime in this decade. The change
in the last month, and especially in the last two
weeks, has been as dramatic a shift" as any he
can recall. In Roach's view, "A credit crunch is
where we're headed."

If this dynamic continues in coming weeks, it could
create the same vicious cycle in the United States
that has undone so many other nations since the
Asian crisis began. At the very least, mortgage
rates, which are pegged to long-term rates, might
not keep dropping if foreign investors continue to be
scared off by the prospect of a falling dollar.
Refinancings to take advantage of lower rates would
also dry up. "So far a silver lining for many
individuals has been the money put into their
pockets when they have refinanced their
mortgages," notes Henry Willmore, chief economist
for Barclays Capital in New York. "A continuing fall
in the dollar and a backup in long-term yields might
take the bloom off that source of prosperity."

To Robert Brusca, the chief economist for Nikko
Securities, the New York-based division of the
Japanese brokerage, the fall in the dollar presents
the Fed with a "two-edged sword," making it harder
to pursue a policy of lowering interest rates to
stimulate the U.S. economy because it risks driving
the dollar lower. And at a time when the United
States is faced with record trade imbalances (on
the order of $15 billion to $20 billion a month), a
lower dollar could scare off foreign investors,
making it harder to finance those trade deficits.
"The U.S. is not in a position to be savior to the
world," notes Brusca. "What we're seeing is that
the U.S. economy has its limits."

A cheaper dollar does have a bright side, to be
sure. As President Clinton pointed out last week, at
least it will give U.S. steelworkers some relief by
raising the price of imported steel. And a cheaper
dollar also makes the dollar-denominated debts of
hard-pressed countries like Thailand and South
Korea easier to repay and relieves pressure on
such troubled currencies as the Brazilian real. But
as the dollar weakens, foreign countries have a
harder time exporting to the United States, as their
goods becomes more expensive to Americans.
That's one reason Japan's Nikkei average closed at
another 13-year low last Thursday following a huge
surge earlier in the week, with the loses
concentrated now among such major exporters as
Toyota. And to the extent that the weaker dollar is
symptomatic of a weakening U.S. economy that
requires more and more easy money to keep
growing, the development is decidedly bearish.

All these trends were enough to prompt J. P.
Morgan to issue the first forecast by a major
financial institution of a U.S. recession in 1999. If
that proves true, Greenspan may want to put off
reading his newspapers for more than just a week
or so.

This kind of unconventional market action is going to undo even the conservative
financial players. As I said before, it is going to drive a large contingent of the world
capitol into "Euro Assets". If the Dow does fall before the Euro launch, much of this
money will go into the EMU basket of eleven currencies regardless of the perceived risk. It will
be the lesser of the two evils. As the dollar falls, gold will unfold into it's new image as a
Euro proxy whereby the Euro becomes the transactional currency for gold settlement, not
the current dollar. It should be an unfolding event, not a crisis run into metal. However, if
the current leverage crisis forces the default of much of the gold carry trade, the spike in
gold that closes the market will ensue. That's the part of Another's Thoughts I don't like.

Mr. Kosares, The new day we begin from a dark long night. The Greenspan, he has seen the end of his dollar as king! See now, how the assets are removed from the back of this
weak beast. It was planned for this time, from years that have passed, how these last days will show a new direction. Your Federal Reserve does now see this new war as a "battle
fought while in retreat"! Indeed, this retreat will become evident as "rates that rise" over a dollar "that does fall"! Gold? You have seen the small sales from small countries? I have waited, with patients, for large sales as some say would surely come. From the time of the Belgium deal, this year early, gold is offered no more. A US dollar price below $280 held the BIS as "the bank with no teeth"! A "one tooth cat" they are not, as this bank does mate with the great tiger of the orient. The last meeting in Hong Kong did
change that world. Both now have the large hunger for gold and consume it as I write. In Europe, my friends the Swiss, they speak of selling yet buy with both hands and both feet!

ALL: Gold looked as if it would drop last week, but it didn't! I think it even bounced off
it's 220 day moving average (a good sign for Technical Analysis) on Friday. Why is it
starting to move up now, at the end of this year? This night (MST) I will offer further
reasoning to go with my earlier posts. Those writings dealt with how the Central Banks
lent gold but never sold it! Now Another has opened the door (in his last post) for some
analysis as to where gold is going and how soon. It should be interesting. Thanks FOA

Friend of Another (10/17/98; 21:33:27MDT - Msg ID:632)
THINKING!
All: If we step back to review the gold market throughout this last year, it offers a
surprising glimpse into an orderly process few thought possible. We have read many times
how this market was in a supply and demand deficit and it was the Central Banks that
were filling the void of un-supplied gold. Some reasoned that if it wasn't for this new
supply the markets would have been much higher by now. No my friends, that just is not
correct! Granted, there is much more gold being consumed than is being mined, but it
wasn't the CB that were supplying most of it. Yes, last year (1997) all the CBs on average
did actually sell off some 400 tonnes +/-, and that was NET sales, not leases. But the
question remains, who supplied the other 700+/- tonnes that made up the total deficit? If
the CB vaults lost only 400 then how could their lending action be identified as the source
of the new supply?? The answer is, it didn't! But I have gone to far, let us back up.
By far, the largest amount of gold lending / leasing is a paper product made possible
through the LBMA. This group of Bullion Banks and brokers (perhaps the Bank of
England also) trades some 30 +/- million ounces of gold a day. A day! Some of it may be
physical and some of it paper, but all of it Very Liquid! With a ready Gold CURENCY
market of this size, there is simply no problem raising paper currency capitol by shorting
paper gold. If you have the correct backing. I am assuming the reader has read my posts
#556 and #585 and much of the Thoughts! of Another.
If an entity can produce some form of collateral along with a Central Banks agreement
to back the gold loan with gold, then a Bullion Bank has little problem supplying cash by
shorting paper gold. The CB does not have to move or sell his gold and receives 1% or
2% for a signature on the general agreement. The BB collects fees and any arbitrage that
may result. The "entity" ( for poster Tyler Rose, that's the 3rd party) obtains little in the
way of return on this investment except for one obvious point. That being, that they will
receive the benefit of any net gains on the repayment of the gold loan, in physical gold,
after the financing is paid. This works because all of the risk is upon the middleman, the
Bullion Bank. Now considering that the BB hedges it's part of any gold risk (increase in
price) in the derivatives market so that in the completion of the deal if gold rises in price
this increase is, as stated above, delivered! As one might reason, the 3rd parties in these
contracts (the buyers that are never reported by the media) are banking on but one thing, a
huge increase in the dollar price of gold! In the event that the BBs are defaulted by current
events or total market failure, it will then be the Central Banks (as ultimate signers of the
General Agreement) that will deliver Real Gold from their vaults!
Now, back to my original point: Much of the extra gold that has been supplied to the
physical markets to cover the supply deficit has come from private holdings. Truly, gold
doesn't come out of thin air and neither the CBs or the mines were offering enough of it to
satisfy demand. Yes, as much as that flies into the face of accepted analysis, these private
Western Holdings were being sold even as the total gold market, including CB holdings
was being cornered by a market that, as Another said long ago "is not as before!
Not all of these maneuverings are done by major 3rd parties. Lately, a good deal of it is
done by traders and financial operators that are naturally attracted to action. These people
will get cleaned out by defaults simply because they don't have anything to offer the world
as a means to force delivery. I think it's called "no ace in the hole". However, any financial
power that has reserves that the economy needs will be supplied or paid in an acceptable
currency if necessary. If we think long enough on this we can see that perhaps next year,
much of the derivatives carry trade will be forced into default. In this meaning, default is
having to pay, not in kind, but in Euros.
But what will trigger this major break in the action, so as to start the ball rolling? It has
already happened. When Asia started to fall many, many months ago, that was the signal
that the first domino was falling. With the Euro expected to arrive in1999, it was time to
break the Asian gold buying (this does not include China as they will be part of Euroland)
and at the same time begin a long term breakdown of the dollar. A destruction that would
carry on for several years. Most of those years have passed.
What of tomorrow? The gold loans will now become harder to repay as the money that
the loans created is destroyed. The Central Banks, that largely stopped backing new loans
earlier this year, have now completely stopped for fear of having to deliver their gold
before the Euro is available. This time period for them has been one of also having no ace
in the hole. From now till the end of the year, they will begin calling in loans (pulling their
signatures) that are now seen as unnecessary. As England is not part of the eleven EMU
nations, look for the LBMA to be seen as carrying heavy risk from default. If the
derivatives markets fail, they will lose what risk hedges they have. This risk should begin
showing itself in the dollar price of gold anytime. With China buying to rid themselves of
dollars preEuro and the Swiss now buying to cover a huge mistake, the market should be
bumping up to $350/$360 by year end! Remember, the Swiss are also a nonEMU
country! thanks FOA

Mr. Unomas,
It is unfortunate for such persons to hold the "paper stocks" during this time of history! Always the "good investment" for "the good times" they are. The future before us will change this thought for many the children of children. Every season has the special feel to the skin and this winter will bring the sand storm as not before. It is not our place to change this weather, rather to wear the correct garments. I have always found the winter,
it does change much to quickly for the traveler with all clothes. These traders will not move with the speed of sand and will find no shelter in paper skins. If the gods be
gracious, these seasons will change slowly, yes? Thank You

Mr. Aragorn, I read your write and this you say: "The modern use redefined the value accordingly". I can add not a word to this post. Your age is 100+, yes? Perhaps I am wrong, your wisdom, it is to die for!
Are you of the world that will use the Euro soon? I think this dollar and Euro will also find the value "redefined"!

I will be gone for a time.

A final thought for all...on the notion of gold value over time relative to all things--particularly a fine suit for a man equating with one ounce. Just let it go. While some things do correlate well for periods of time, history may bear false witness when looking toward things to come. This is a world not as before. I offer this simple, real-world example. There was a time, not long ago, when gold panners in Columbia were frustrated with the abundance of hard grey "pebbles" that would litter the final washings of their gold. They heavy nuisances were discarded with disdain. Today we value platinum a bit higher than they would have imagined. The modern use redefined the value accordingly.

So it will be with gold. It is very important to remember that these are not the days of the pharaohs, the kings, or the czars. There are more people ALIVE today than the sum total of all who have lived and died before us. Economies have grown geometrically while the supply of real money (gold) has failed to keep pace. The price of everything in terms of gold actually decline over time. This has been obscured during the modern geometric growth of economies because the world has been detatched from a gold standard for the casual observer. As the pendulum swings its return, many will indeed be surprised that all things priced in gold have become so very much cheaper. This is good. The excess production of your youth (measured in gold) will not abandon you in your old age as a fiat currency is want to do. To express this in dollar terms for those who cannot detach their view from this measuring standard--if the U.S. reacted intelligently, naturally, and did not cling tenaciously to the current structure, they would peg the dollar to gold. Under this arrangement an ounce of gold would be priced at many thousands of dollars while a gallon of milk would remain at only two dollars. If the U.S. does not peg to gold, and they fight the stubborn fight, the dollar would be worthless relative to all things. Gold would be priced at many thousands and food would be priced beyond your best guesses.

Rate-cut uncertainty
undermines pound

by BEN LEAPMAN

THE Bank of England will wait two more weeks
before deciding whether to make a further cut in
interest rates despite feverish City speculation
about emergency measures.

The prospect of an unscheduled rate cut was today
continuing to undermine the pound, after weekend
Press reports suggested that the Bank's monetary
policy committee was about to go into emergency
session. However, the MPC is understood to be
sticking to its timetable on which the next rates
decision is due on 5 November. On Friday a Bank
spokesman denied that an emergency meeting
was taking place that day. The nine members of
the MPC are all in regular contact because they are
overseeing the creation of the Bank's quarterly
Inflation Report and forecasts, due to be published
on 11 November.

Sterling today fell half a pfennig to Dm2.757, barely
above its 18-month low, although it rose a third of a
cent to $1.705 versus a slumping dollar. Attention
was focused on the Bundesbank, which will decide
on Thursday whether to cut German interest rates
following cuts in America, Canada and Britain.

The Bundesbank is thought likely to resist pressure
to cut, but it could change its mind if the mark rises
sharply enough to hurt German exporters. Today
the dollar fell three-quarters of a pfennig to
Dm1.6165, threatening to fall below 1.60 for the
first time since January 1997.

VERY GOOD SPEECH!
ALL: Prior to the USAGOLD Forum we had posted an excerpt from another meeting of
the American Enterprise Institute. They are located in Washington D.C. and are very
active in discussing world affairs, including a separate section devoted to New Atlantic
Initiative (NAI). This is a brief introduction to a meeting held in Istanbul, May 1-3, 1998.
Please read all of the preamble to this speech given by Mr. Michael Portillo. The speech
also follows and is extremely timely to your investments decisions if your thinking involves
politics. They are located at http://www.aei.org/start.htm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• NAI holds annual congress in Istanbul, May 1-3, 1998.
-----------------------------------------------------------
On Thursday, April 30, 1998, the United States Senate voted 80 to 19 (with one
abstention) to ratify an amendment to the North Atlantic Treaty that will allow Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join NATO. The following day, the European
Parliament met to decide which member-countries would qualify to join the European
Monetary Union on January 1, 1999.

The same weekend the New Atlantic Initiative, headquartered at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., in association with the Turkish American
Association in Ankara, held its annual congress in Istanbul. Turkey, a NATO member,
is a country of "vital interest and concern," NAI executive director Jeffrey Gedmin
remarked, "and we wanted to underscore Turkey's importance as a valuable member
of the Atlantic community."

More than 400 distinguished political, intellectual, and business leaders from more than
twenty countries participated in the Congress of Istanbul. In plenary and breakout
sessions, speakers and delegates tackled issues of democracy and Islam, European
Monetary Union, NATO enlargement, free trade and the transatlantic marketplace, and
security in the Balkans and the Middle East, among others. Delegates received written
greetings and words of support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Polish
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Leszek Balcerowicz, former U.S.
secretary of state Henry Kissinger, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich.
------------------------------------------------------------
• NAI hosts Michael Portillo ------------------------------ Will European Monetary Union Fracture the
Atlantic Alliance?
----------------------------------------------------------
Former British defense minister Michael Portillo unwaveringly answered yes. In
keynote remarks delivered Wednesday, May 27, at the American Enterprise Institute,
Mr. Portillo argued that the single European currency has nothing to do with
economics. Rather, it is an essential part of a new European state–one that is
potentially less democratic, more hostile to the Anglo-Saxon economic model, and
decidedly at odds with America over matters of security and foreign policy. Speaking
at the NAI's annual congress in Istanbul, Mr. Portillo warned that "it would seem to me
foolhardy to abandon our very long-established alliance with America, in the visionary
hope that Europeans can find a satisfactory common outlook which has eluded them
until now." Jeane Kirkpatrick, director of foreign and defense policy studies at AEI and
former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Richard Perle, a resident fellow at
AEI and former U.S. assistant secretary of defense, also spoke at the May 27 lecture.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extract from remarks made by the Rt. Hon. Michael Portillo to the-----------------------------------------------------
---- New Atlantic Initiative Congress of Istanbul--
---------------------- May 2, 1998------------------------------------

Speaker Gingrich was not the first, but he is the most recent, to point out that Europe's
headlong rush to monetary union looks perilous. Processes that took more than a
century in the development of the United States are being squeezed into a few brief
years. In America a nation was created, with much discussion of what should be the
balance of powers between states and union. In Europe we have reversed the logical
order of nation building, and the visionaries are trying to create a European state by
creating first the attributes of a state, such as a single currency, long before the
balancing competences of Europe and its member states have been defined.

As Mr. Gingrich has pointed out, a single currency where we do not have a single labor
market brings particular dangers. Europe contains many different economies, with
different cycles and varying speeds. Any one of them is prone to recession, but in a
Europe where there are different currencies, any state can, by adjusting its currency and
interest rates, provide itself with a natural stabilizer. The idea of applying a single
exchange rate and a single interest rate to such diverse economies is economic
madness.

But there is a simple explanation. The justification for the single currency has almost
nothing to do with economics. It is the essential foundation for a new European state.
In fourteen member states that logic and ambition are openly avowed and applauded.
Only in Britain, where the idea of a single European state is viewed with widespread
public hostility, do politicians pretend that the single currency is about completing the
European single market, with virtually no political implications at all.

Fortunately, Dr. Helmut Hesse, a member of the directorate of the Bundesbank is more
honest and tells us straightforwardly that "monetary union is the last step in a process of
integration that began only a few years after the second world war in order to bring
peace and prosperity to Europe." Of course it is, and that is why any querying of the
pace of monetary union or the validity of the convergence process strikes Britain's
European partners as mere pedantry and obscurantism. Our partners are on their way
to their federal destiny and nothing can stop them.

You have to take seriously their visionary idealism. Nationalism, they argue, caused the
wars of the past in which millions of European and thousands of Americans have died.
Abolish the nation states and you have eradicated the cause of conflict. You have to
take it seriously, but you are not obliged to agree with it.

It is true that extremist nationalism has been a root cause of past wars. But there is no
reason to believe that abolishing the nation states, by creating a European state to
replace them, will do away with nationalism. Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union should
sufficiently tell us that. In any case, past wars had complex causes. They were started
by tyrants who capitalized upon a sense of national grievance – some piece of territory
or some population that yearned to be reunited with the motherland.

One of the worries about the single currency is precisely that it will lead to less
democracy and new causes of grievance. The central European Bank will make
decisions on interest rates for all countries participating in EMU. As Dr. Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank President, has remarked candidly, it is an illusion to think that member
countries could then retain national autonomy over taxation and labor market issues.
So the political decisions most critical to the economic life of people in the member
states, decisions affecting their wealth and the rate of unemployment, will be in the
hands of the ECB. But of course that body is not democratically accountable. No one
will vote for it, and it will not be under governmental or parliamentary control in the way
that national central banks normally are.

Imagine what might be the impact, once we have a single currency, on people in a part
of Europe suffering from recession. The substantial barriers to free movement of labor
prevent them from seeking work elsewhere in Europe. They cannot vote to change the
policies that have made them jobless, because those policies are made above the
level of national government and beyond democratic control. They will be able to see
that other countries are faring better, and that whilst the single exchange rate and
interest rate may suit their neighbors, it is crippling job opportunities at home. That will
produce a sense of grievance, a source of bitterness between peoples in Europe, and
a sharp reduction in democracy.

Of course, in theory the democratic deficit can be filled by boosting the status and
power of the European parliament. In my view that will not do. Democracy has to
operate within a society of shared values and experience, otherwise people will not feel
that the parliament for which they vote is representative of their interests. The United
States, despite its size and ethnic diversity and thanks to its historical experience, has
such a shared set of values, and they are regularly articulated by politicians and by the
people. Europeans evidently do not share a set of values, and you will not be able
simultaneously to convince Greeks and Irish and Swedes that they are adequately
represented in a body drawn from such politically diverse places.

Some of the differences show up in the very dissimilar national approaches to foreign
policy. To the frustration of America, European nations have disagreed sharply on
most critical issues in recent years: the Falklands War, South African apartheid, the
Gulf War, subsequent policy towards Iraq, Bosnia and the Great Lakes area of Africa.
Now it is proposed that Europe should have a common foreign and security policy, and
one can imagine a cheer going up in Washington at the prospect of at last hearing
Europe speak with one voice.

That might be the wrong reaction. America needs to consider what such a common
policy might look like, and all the evidence so far is that is would not be pro-American,
and indeed might be anti.

For those intent on building the new European state, the creation of a common foreign
and security policy is essential. Along with EMU and a common border, it represents a
critical attribute of a sovereign state. Given the diversity of actual views in Europe,
common positions could only be arrived at by majority voting. So far only actions in
pursuit of positions already arrived at by consensus are to be subject to majority voting.
But it is the clear intention to move further.

Those European countries offering support to the United States in recent times, over
Libya or Iraq for example, have been in a small minority. Under a common foreign
policy decided by majority voting, they could be outvoted, and they would have
surrendered the option of adopting an independent national position.

For the United Kingdom, and maybe others, that is a dismal prospect. The UK has a
long history of joint work and action with the U.S. in diplomacy and military action. We
share many values in common and agree on foreign policy stances much more often
than not. Demonstrably, we have agreed rather less with our close European
neighbors. It would seem to me foolhardy to abandon our very long-established alliance
with America, in the visionary hope that Europeans can find a satisfactory common
outlook which has eluded them until now.

Frequently, the only policy position on which it might be possible to achieve a majority in
Europe, would be inaction. The policy paralysis that has gripped Europe in the past
would be institutionalized, and America would lose any European voice of support in its
global role of combating tyranny.

Bad though that seems, things could actually be worse. Those who look forward to
European political union tend to favor the prospect of a European political bloc which
follows policies which are distinctive from America's Some of those who promote the
idea of a common European foreign and security policy undoubtedly wish to see a
reduction in American influence in Europe. That has been a recurring theme in the
decades following the last war. There have been calls to replace NATO or reduce
American influence within it. The more America has been needed, the more that
dependency has been resented.

Those who dream of a Europe free from American influence and rid of U.S. forces also
look forward to the emergence of Europe as a new power in world affairs that can be a
counter-balance to America. For those reasons I would expect a common European
policy to veer between being un-American and anti-American.

I fear that there are those building the European state who hope also that it can offer an
alternative economic model to the Anglo-Saxon world. There is much talk of social
Europe. It is a code for maintaining much higher levels of public spending and a much
bigger role for the state than has become the norm in today's world. European
governments tend to be much more statist and corporatist, and they feel unable to
adjust to a competitive world which tends to place more emphasis on the
encouragement of enterprise and a reduced role for government in the economy. They
cherish the hope of building a Europe big enough to resist the competitive pressures of
the outside world.

In Britain, and a number of countries in Europe, large parts of public opinion are
unconvinced by the arguments for political union. But a lethargy is undermining them.
The most effective argument which is wearing down their resistance is that European
political integration is inevitable, and cannot and should not be resisted.

What is needed is an alternative. We must explain that countries need not travel down
the route to the extinction of the nation states of Europe. People in Europe are being
led to believe that the only alternative to political union is isolation. This is absurd in a
world where the nations of the world are increasingly united in their approaches, with an
ever-larger number of liberal democracies, an increasing acceptance of liberal
economics and with technology linking our peoples ever close together.

Hallmarking of gold shows big increase!
MANAMA: Gold hallmarking figures have dramatically increased this year, as
compared with the past two years, it was announced yesterday.
----------------------------------
Bahrain Assay Section head Abdul Khaliq Al Bosta said 1,018,493 individual
gold pieces, weighing 7,295,352gm, were hallmarked from January to
September this year.
----------------------------
This figure, he said, showed an increase of nearly 10 per cent when compared
with the same period in 1996.

"This March we recorded an all time high of hallmarking over a million grams
of 140,943 individual pieces, which is a growth of 31.3pc when compared with
the same period last year," said Mr Al Bosta.

"Over the last month, in preparation for the Wonders of Gold Exhibition, the
Assay Section has been busy, working extra hours to cope with the influx of
Bahraini gold. We anticipate figures for gold hallmarking this month to be the
highest yet," he said.

The Wonders of Gold '98 Exhibition, under the patronage of Prime Minister
Shaikh Khalifa bin Sulman Al Khalifa, is due to take place at the Le Royal
Meridien Hotel from October 28 to November 2.

It is being organised by the BPMB, in co-operation with Bahrain International
Exhibition Centre.

Bahrain Promotions and Marketing Board (BPMB) acting chief executive
Robin Marriott said the rise proved that jewellers were working very hard and
looking forward to booming sales during the upcoming exhibition.

"The increase in figures is largely due to the success of the gold exhibition
and the high standards of Bahrain's gold hallmarking legislation.

"Bahraini hallmarked gold serves as a guarantee to shoppers, that what they
are buying is genuine quality. All jewellery on display at the exhibition and
sold in Bahrain has to be hallmarked," he said.

Arabia and South Africa!
Bahrain studies pacts to bolster South Africa ties

MANAMA: Bahrain and other GCC states are exploring the possibility of
signing agreements with South Africa, to promote bilateral trade and
investment.

South Africa is keen to forge ties with new partners, in a bid to become a
major player in international trade and investment, said Counsellor, political, at
the South African Embassy in Riyadh Ashraf Suliman.

He was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on South African-Gulf
Connection: Investing towards a new millennium, held yesterday at the
Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The event was organised by the South African Embassy in Riyadh, in
conjunction with the chamber.

Chamber president Ali bin Yousuf Fakhro said he hoped the event would be
the start of a series of similar events in Bahrain and South Africa, to promote
bilateral trade and investment.

"Our relations with the Gulf have been booming since 1994, when the African
National Congress (ANC) government came into power," said Mr Suliman.

Gulf states and South Africa recognise a need to enter into an equal
partnership, which would benefit all concerned.

"With Bahrain and Kuwait, we are discussing a treaty for avoidance of double
taxation and for investment protection," said Mr Suliman.

He said draft treaties had been exchanged with both countries and
negotiations were currently underway.

With Saudi Arabia, South Africa is set to sign several treaties later this year.

Two-way trade between South Africa and Saudi Arabia had reached one billion
Saudi riyal (BD10 million) and the country was South Africa's biggest trading
partner in the region.

The agreements to be signed, during a visit to Saudi Arabia by South African
deputy president Thabo Mbeki, will include an overall co-operation agreement,
a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on oil, a defence co-operation
agreement, a trade and investment agreement and a sports and culture
agreement.

In addition, the chambers of commerce of the two countries will also sign a
co-operation protocol.

Chief executive of the Government-owned promotion body Investment South
Africa Rafiq Bagus said South Africa was a member of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) and was committed to international trade practices.

Objectives of the government's economic strategy was to achieve a growth
rate of six per cent and create 400,000 jobs per annum.

This would be done through deficit reduction, phasing out of exchange
controls, reducing inflation, rationalisation of tariffs, restructuring of state
assets, reduction of corporate and personal tax and enhancing global
competitiveness.

Inflation was currently hovering at 8pc to 10pc and the budgeratry deficit had
been reduced to 10pc of gross domestic product (GDP), said Mr Bagus.

He said the country's economy, which was in the past focused on import
substitution, was being re-oriented towards an export economy.

Mr Bagus said crime in South Africa was being adequately dealt with and the
Government was committed to eradicating crime.

The two areas in which crime has increased is crime against women and
crime against children, he said.

PH, I'm glad you read the article from AEI presented in my #656 post. I like your last sentence "Pointing out the rigors of the journey is a coward's argument against embarking on the journey altogether."
------------------------------------------------------------------
That is so true! Has no one studied world history? It seems that every country has traveled
a difficult road during their creation. Need we use American History as an example? Also,
every one of them have experienced turmoil during their existence. Why then, do the
analysis see that the rocky road ahead for Europe as a prelude to failure? If every country
that experienced political, labor and financial troubles failed because of them, no nation
would exist! -----------------------------Some how, I feel that Mr. Portillo is trying to show
that the EMU will come about in spite of all of the obstacles, because it is more a
political / nationalist union than financial! I say nationalist in respect to the European
urge to go their own way and not be part of the United States as a monetary offspring. I
agree that it will fracture the Atlantic alliance. It is this fracture that so impacts the middle
east oil interest if only because Europe is closer and where America is an ocean away.
------------------ One can see that much of his speech is from an English vantage point
knowing full well that England may never enter the EMU / Euro world. However, reading
closely we see the very European notions being analyzed. Those notions are real and
projected outright in Europe today. If they produce a solid Euro it will pull in China, India
and the Middle East (oil). With Asia, South America, Canada and Mexico headed for
total breakdown, the impact of a new European Powerhouse upon the US dollar would be
colossal! While traders worry about a few dollar change in gold, they lose sight of the
financial missile coming straight at them. FOA

E- Mail question sent to USAGOLD!
Another,
You said on July 19,1998, "The US Federal Reserve will now have little
choice but to raise interest rates as the dollar currency inflation of past years moves from
"paper assets" into real things."
----------------------------------------
We hardly see this to be the case in recent weeks. Would you please care to comment.
---------------------------------------------------------
David L.B.
-----------------------------------------------------------
David,------------------ I would like to comment on this. You may already well know that
currency inflation and price inflation are two different things. If your statement of "We
hardly see this" is applied to price inflation in the USA today, then I totally agree. In years
past the great inflations that occurred in nations with dominant currencies were not subject
to markets that were worldwide in scope. Those inflations (currency inflation and the
resulting price rise) were played out in a more local arena. Even the most recent example,
the German inflation, did not have the moderating influence of a world economy
marketplace as today. In that time, large increases in money assets were quickly followed
by increases in the prices of goods and services. They had no real means of exporting their
money asset inflation to other countries (sending currency out of the nation to be held as
asset reserves or to buy goods for import) in order to negate a domestic price rise. Gold,
as part of the world monetary settlement system helped to block that path.
-------------------------Current examples of money inflation and the resulting price inflation
such as in Mexico, Brazil, Korea, etc., all have resulted because they too can not export
their money assets on par with other currencies. The exchange rates, almost like gold,
block their path. However, we must understand that these are not major currencies much
less world reserve currencies. The dollar of present operates in a world currency system
without gold, that allows this currency to be exported without restraint. Any attempted
exchange rate adjustments implemented to block this movement (dollar falls and the Mark,
Yen, etc. rise) runs head on into a loss of trade with the America. The result is a dirty float
of exchange rates in that most Central Banks artificially keep the dollar flowing out of the
US because they have on viable alternative vehicle to base trade values on.
------------------------------------------------ Using this line of reasoning, we can see how a
massive inflation of dollars over many years has built up. When something does come
along that blocks that outflow of dollars and even causes it to reverse, the dollar will
plunge on exchange rates and bring home all of the past buildup of price inflation. Indeed,
the dollar and it's price inflation will look much like Mexico and the lot. As you have seen
lately, they always raise interest rates in Mexico and Brazil in an effort just to keep the
currency in use. In like mind, so will the Federal Reserve raise rates as needed with little
regard for local economic conditions. If the Fed can lower rates, as they just did, for a
non-economic purpose (to kill off several Hedge Funds and save several banks) so to will
they raise rates to save the dollar!-----------------------David, it's important to understand
that Another must think with a view for the world financial framework, not just the USA.
I agree that US rates will be rising soon as the dollar is severally challenged by the Euro.

Buena FE,---------------------Hello! Yes, I agree that the Argentina gold sale announcement (see USAGOLD MK post) is no less than market posturing. The same thing happened with the Russian gold sale speculation. They did, by the way, sell some gold, but as soon as it hit the market it was picked up with ease. The media and short brokers made a big deal of it. After selling a small amount (one tonne) the Russians
stopped? --------------
It's the paper gold and derivative gold markets that make move on these normal events than needed. They are so leveraged that any news at all sends them off. But, notice over the last weeks and months how these sale stories have lost impact on the gold price. It comes right back after a few days. That's because the paper markets brace for an
onslaught of new paper supply that doesn't come. Lease rates are on rock bottom as only a few lenders are trying to manipulate a market that has even fewer "Qualified" players. I add that they are not Qualified because the Major CBs are not signing on anymore! Truth be told, they started slowing down the leasing game just as soon as the Euro had gained
the eye producers to become an oil settlement vehicle. And no doubt that was prompted by the use of gold in it's reserve mix! --------------------------------Look for these down drafts in gold to be shallow. I think it will trade up back into the range that the Euro Group CBs wanted it be in, $320 / $360 and no higher. At least until year end.

Argentine coin sale??
David Linkley (10/20/98; 18:39:57MDT - Msg ID:686)
------------------------------------
Thanks for the post about the Argentine coin sale. Why would they offer to melt the coins
for sale? Everyone on the planet knows that gold in recognized coin form can be readily
used to pay off debts, even large ones. My observations are: They will do the same as
Russia and sell only 30 or 40 thousand ounces (perhaps 100,000 coins?) then stop the
sales. OR They will melt them down anyway (without offering them in coin form) because
someone is pressuring them to fill a physical void of bullion bars.
------------------------------------USAGOLD: It will be very interesting to see just how
many of these coins Do end up on inventory with precious metal dealers in the USA, or
anywhere. I have heard nothing about it being offered as a package to the investment
community? -----------------------------------------ALL: If this is a true sale (not just market
posturing) then it may be viewed as the most bullish conformation of an impending gold
crisis the world has had. It's one thing for a national Central Bank to sell gold bullion and
quite another to sell it's last pre-minted (old) coins in large amounts. We truly may be
entering the beginning of gold bull market brought about the relentless selling of gold that
hasn't been delivered to date. If the financial operators (hedge funds) are shut off from
borrowing gold (even with low rates) because of performance problems, the game is
winding down! When the flash point is reached, we should quickly move back to the $320
/ $360 area with an over run of, perhaps $50 above that. For investors that gamble, the
gamble today will be timing the purchase of gold. If the market runs far above accepted
levels, before the end of the year, massive default could occur. In that climate, no one will
buy or sell gold. Dynamic time lie just ahead! FOA

Japan's bank breakthrough!


THE Japanese government today made a
breakthrough in its drive to shore up the banking
sector as a major solvent bank stepped forward to
accept public funding.

Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's
seventh-biggest lender, stressed it was accepting
taxpayers' money for the good of the nation and the
financial system, not because it needed extra
capital.

Tokyo has defied international critics by finalising a
60 trillion yen (£303 billion) package of State
funding to tackle the bad-debt crisis.

However, analysts feared the rescue plan would
founder because no healthy bank would want to be
seen to accept public funding. the Nikkei 225
Average closed 408 points up at 14,216, led by
banking shares.

Coin Auction?
USAGOLD: "Little effect on the price of gold"? I'm sure you expect no downside
pressure from this sale. Michael, I bet a gold auction is the last thing the US treasury
wants! It wouldn't surprise me if we hear them change this to an outright gold sale. I say
this because the last time open free market auctioning of gold took place was in the late
70s when the USA sold one million a month. These types of sales tend to raise public
attention about gold and usually increase the bidding! ------------------------------------ I
have to say again, for them to offer pre-1900 coins as an obvious type of bullion-for-debt-
retirement sale must be the absolute most bullish development in the gold market. When
this market does turn, it will be after every last possible ounce of physical has been
offered, leaving nothing but the trading of paper gold debt. Some replies, then more on
this later. I want to check on something. FOA

REPLY TO: Gandalf the White (10/21/98; 10:29:55MDT - Msg ID:699)
Gandalf, -------------- In your post you mention "us simple stupid folks". Well, there are
more than a few people that are "simple" and a number of them are even "folks". I have
known and do presently know these types of people. Many of them have a way of
expressing thoughts and aspirations about life and wealth with such logic that it usually
leaves me feeling "stupid"! ---------------------------------------------------Your question:
"Who sets the "accepted levels" ? The ECB's? ------------- Much of the large scale gold
leasing began with the same group of Central Banks that will be part of the EMU. The
leasing expanded with the idea that the dollar price of gold could be lowered without
having to put actual physical gold, from the vaults, on the market. As much as the world
financial analysis hate to say it, gold is still the measuring stick for currencies. Many paper
currencies are valued mostly by their exchange rates against the dollar, so the gold price in
their terms is not as important. However, in order to increase the prestige of the dollar, the
world reserve currency, gold (the currency) had to be devalued in dollar terms. This type
of nonphysical gold manipulation could only work during the end time for the dollar. With
the dollar reaching the end of it's paper currency life cycle, most nations and national
Central Banks do not actually hold enough physical gold (in amounts that are relative to
circulating currencies). They hold some gold, but mostly rely on the public gold markets
to judge how acceptable currencies are. ---------------------------- The post of :Aragorn III
(10/21/98; 11:10:08MDT - Msg ID:700) -- gives an excellent feel for the fiat money
cycle.--------------
The Euro was taking much longer to create than once thought, and the 90s were about to
see the dollar dropped from settlement standards. More on this in a minute. ------ In order
to retain the dollar as the leading currency, it's gold price was lowered by allowing certain
investors (3rd parties?) to use collateral to finance the purchase of leased gold from CBs.
The gold was left in the vaults as leased assets and the cash created by the sale was used
to add liquidity to the world financial structure. In return for this sale of gold, certain
commodities were supplied in such quantities as to keep their price low in dollar terms
(oil). Because oil is settled in dollars, and because it is a far larger and visible market than
gold, in this action. the dollar was also further enhanced as a reserve
currency.-------------------------This process alone, the falling prices of oil and gold, was
enough to set off a world liquidity expansion as never seen before. This was needed
because the dollar, in the early 90s had stopped expanding (read that as debt was
contracting) and threatened the world with a financial crisis. A crisis that would occur
without an alternative currency system. In many ways this seed was planted in the 1987
crash-----------see this as a partial reply to-- (scp (10/20/98; 11:24:55MDT - Msg
ID:679).---------------------------------------------As you may now see, the original purpose
of leasing gold was not to put the gold on the street, but to use it as a leverage to raise the
dollar value and in turn increase liquidity, they were buying time. Many of these loans
were indeed for the expansion of mining with the intention of physical gold being used for
repayment. Everyone always assumed that the gold from the mines was going to flow
back into the CB vaults. But, what no one questioned, was, if the gold never left the CB
vaults (see my other posts) why would it go back there? No, a good deal of this gold
repayment will flow through the Bullion Banks and arrive in Another account! But don't
look for a road map showing the world the path, it will not be discussed! ---------------
As for the gold loans that went to expand financial (paper) dealings (hedge funds and
countless others) they were to be self liquidating. If the loans blew up then the CB vault
gold would be delivered (again see my other posts). The escape route, in this
circumstance, for the CBs was to be the Euro. If it became strong and replaced the dollar
for oil settlement, among others, then the Euro could actually be printed and delivered for
oil, in affect, buying gold! An action that the new ECB will conduct with it's new EMCBs.
----------------------------------- Again, your other question: Who will default and why ?
------------- With the leasing market expanding, along with stock, bond, derivatives and
currencies markets, financial operators jumped into the game (LTCM) mostly because
they read it wrong. These people (Andy Smith??) are the ones that helped send the gold
market much lower than it's original simple purpose intended. No entity was ever
dumping enough gold onto the market to drive it that low (below $320??). The leverage
paper boys had figured out the game and were exploiting it. It was the Euro bickering that
delayed it's debut long enough for the Shorts to get a foothold into the market and drive
the paper price down. This is one of the major reasons that some CBs actually did SELL
some gold. To keep the market from exploding. (see my other posts) Add to this that the
Asians had started buying actual physical at these low prices and you had the makings of a
disaster. A disaster in that the CBs may have to deliver more gold than they had!
------------------------------- This is the flash point that Another has described as being "at
the door" today. If the Shorts ever have to start covering, the entire market, as we know it
will stop functioning. --------------------- As for the "anyone" in your question: "Why will
not anyone buy or sell gold ? please explain "anyone"------------- It's you my friend, and
me, and everyone that reads this post. Look back in history and you will see that when the
gold price, on and off the market, is soaring, NO ONE will SELL to ANYONE!!
Especially if the world reserve currency is being destroyed. --------------I think I have said
enough for now. More replies later.--- Thanks --- FOA

Govt to take
unexploited mining
rights

Stephané Bothma and David McKay

PRETORIA - Government intends to nationalise
SA's unexploited mineral rights in the next 20
years to give black companies greater access to
them.

Releasing a policy white paper and draft
legislation for SA's new mining and minerals
policy yesterday, Minerals and Energy Minister
Penuell Maduna said it was unacceptable to
government that two-thirds of private ownership of
mineral rights was in white hands. However
Maduna said current mining operations and bona
fide intended operations would be allowed to
continue and would not be tampered with by
government.

This did little to ease the fears of SA's mining
industry which believes that government
proposals could lower the value of mining
companies' shares.

SA mining industry's umbrella organisation, the
Chamber of Mines, said that while the state must
be the custodian of SA's mineral resources, a
system of state regulation could not infringe on the
property rights of private mineral rights holders.

It said government's white paper was the most
significant indication of government policy
towards the mining industry since it came to office
in 1994.

Maduna expressed great concern about the
downscaling of the industry and said the white
paper was an important policy indicator for the
short and medium term.

"In a nutshell, the department will facilitate the
establishment of institutional support structures to
alleviate the devastating social costs of the
downscaling process," he said.

"While we want to prevent the hoarding of mineral
rights and the sterilisation of mineral resources,
there must be no doubt that security of tenure will
be guaranteed. We do not want the industry to
operate under a cloud of uncertainty," he said.

Government's long-term objective was for all
mineral rights to vest in the state, but as a
transitional measure, a new system for granting
access to mineral rights would apply.

The new system's main aspect would be that the
right to prospect for and to mine all minerals
would vest in the state without infringing on the
rights of existing mining rights holders. Maduna
said the white paper mentioned no specific
transition period, but he expected it to be about
20 years.

"Security of tenure will be ensured by granting
prospecting and mining rights for specific
periods, which are capable of cancellation or
revocation only for material breach of the terms
and conditions of the rights.

"The holder of a prospecting right will be entitled
to progress to a mining right on compliance with
prescribed criteria and commitments."

Maduna said the "use it and keep it" principle
would be introduced to discourage unproductive
holding of rights and also to ensure retention
where exploitation might not be economic or
might disrupt markets.

"Royalties will be payable by the holder of a
mining right to the registered holder of the mineral
rights."

He said the policy sought to ensure stability and
continuity of current prospecting and mining
operations through statutory provisions such as:

 The "use it and keep it" principle;

 A transitional period to allow the holders of
prospecting, mining and mineral rights to license
their operations in terms of the new system;

 Allowing the holders of prospecting, mining and
mineral rights to license bona fide intended
prospecting and mining operations; and

 Giving the holders of prospecting, mining and
mineral rights the opportunity to substantiate why
areas which were not utilised should not be
granted to another party.

Maduna said all information from prospecting
would be submitted to the state after completion
or abandonment of a particular prospecting
activity and unless the prospector retained a
prospecting or mining right, the data would be
released to the public. "The freeing of mineral
rights will facilitate greater investment in the
mineral industry, also by small-scale miners." Well
managed small-scale mining had the potential to
take over and mine economically where
large-scale mining was unable to operate
profitably.

Maduna said government was committed to
expedite the full implementation of the Mine
Health and Safety Act which placed the
responsibility for health and safety on the
shoulders of the employer.

With the release of the white paper and the
legislation which would follow, probably only after
next year's general elections, mining no longer
needed to be the domain of the rich and powerful.

"We as government, through the process outlined
in the paper, have made mining accessible to all."

NEWS!
BRUSSELS, Belgium (October 21, 1998 10:03 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) -- The
European Union economy remains an "island of stability" in a turbulent financial world
but will nevertheless expand more slowly than expected next year, the EU said
Wednesday.

The predicted slowdown is likely to increase calls for European nations to boost their
economies by increasing investment or cutting interest rates, already at record lows.
EU leaders are expected to discuss their response at a weekend summit in the
Austrian lakeside resort of Poertschach.

The 15-nation bloc is enjoying its greatest economic growth in a decade, 2.9 percent,
and will continue to do so until the end of the year, the EU said.

But then the financial instability in other parts of the world, especially Russia and Asia,
will kick in, narrowing the EU expansion to 2.4 percent next year. That's down from the 3
percent predicted in March, the EU's last forecast.

"In 1999, the international crisis will take a toll, albeit limited," the EU said in a
statement. "With the renewed pickup of growth and trade at the world level in 2000,
there is again scope for a reacceleration of economic expansion in the EU."

Assuming the world economy bounces back in 2000, the EU said its economic growth
should then recover to 2.8 percent.

"The overall picture is favorable. Economic growth in the EU is expected to remain
strong ... driven essentially by internal consumption and investment," said the report
from the EU's executive body, the European Commission.

The forecast showed Europe's stubbornly high unemployment falling slightly faster than
predicted in March. The jobless rate is seen at 9.5 percent next year, dipping below 10
percent for the first time in the 1990s.

The EU said tough budgetary policies imposed in recent years to prepare for the launch
of the euro as the common currency of 11 EU nations helped protect the bloc from the
turmoil abroad.

"The euro zone forms an island of stability." Interest rates are already at record low
levels and inflation, at 1.6 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year, is "historically
low."

Among the 11 nations that plan to switch to the euro on New Year's Day, growth is seen
at 3 percent this year slowing to 2.6 percent in 1999.

In Germany, the EU's largest economy, growth is expected seen peaking at 2.8 percent
this year then dipping to 2.2 percent in 1999 and 2.6 percent in 2000.

Ireland is set to continue as the EU's fastest-expanding economy with growth at 11.4
percent this year, almost four-times the EU average, before slowing to 8.2 percent next
year.

The Birth of the Euro: by Peter Ludlow
THE AUTHOR

Peter Ludlow is Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels. http://www.euro-emu.co.uk/aboutus/thinktanks.shtml#ceps

In T.S. Eliot's poem, The Journey of the Magi, the wise
men asked about the journey that they had undertaken
together:

were we led all that way for Birth or Death?

To judge by much of the comment that has appeared on
EMU in the last few weeks and more particularly over the
last weekend, many of those best placed to know seem
similarly confused about what it is that is happening.

The pessimists come in various shapes and colours. They include City of London
pundits, German professors and, by no means least, ardent Europeans. Despite the
very different motives of those involved, their message is remarkably similar. Unless
the European Union does not rapidly cobble together a Political Union, EMU can
only end in disaster.

Who then is to be believed- those who rejoice at a birth, or those who prophesy
death?

It would be tempting simply to dismiss the sceptics with the observation that those
who have been so often wrong about EMU in the past have little claim to credence
when they pronounce on the future. Contrary to their expectations EMU is being
launched on time and with a broad membership. Although, however, a little more
humility would not be inappropriate on the part of those who have been proved so
spectacularly wrong, it would be mistaken for those of us who always argued that
success was likelier than failure to crow too soon or too loudly. The fact is that EMU
is itself a journey into the unknown.

That said, there are important clues which point to what it might mean- and, with still
more strength, to what it does not mean. To begin with the latter. One of the more
obvious explanations of the errors of those who have said that EMU would not
happen - and who now say that it cannot last-is that they have looked at Europe with
eyes conditioned by the experience of mature nation states, and more particularly
the United States of America. Hence the dreary incantation time after time of the
phrase 'history shows'. The past that we need to look at as a guide to the future is
not however the history of America or even Germany, but the history of the EU itself.
The future will doubtless hold many surprises as EMU takes root, but the political
and economic parameters in which the experiment will be worked out are relatively
well defined.

In economic terms, the basic point of reference is the Single Market, which though
by no means perfect, is a reality of growing- and irreversible- significance to
governments, business and private individuals alike. Monetary Union may not be a
necessary corollary of the Single Market, but it is certainly a logical one. Almost
every sensible list of what EMU is likely to entail in economic terms turns out on
closer inspection to be made up of developments which the Single Market already
implies. The Monti initiative on the need for greater coordination and cooperation in
tax matters is a case in point, increased transparency in pricing another.

EMU will undoubtedly have an important economic impact in area after area, and
there may well be - indeed there certainly will be- important policy initiatives to meet
unexpected situations. The policies in question will however work with rather than
against the grain already established in decades of experience with a Customs
Union and, more recently, a Single Market.

A similar line of argument is germane when we try to assess the likely impact of
EMU on the EU's system of government. The first point to emphasise is of course
that it is a system of government, even if it is very different in character from
government systems at national level.For the purposes of the present discussion its
most important features are three. Firstly, it is highly decentralised. Most policies
and laws are implemented through national administrations,who are also the key
decisionmakers at the 'supranational' level.

Secondly, its central institutions dispose of a budget which is minute compared with
those of other 'central' governments, and of no significance in macroeconomic terms,
except for some of the smaller, poorer countries who are amongst its principal
beneficiaries. Thirdly, to achieve its ends European government relies principally on
rules, whether in the form of laws, which have primacy over national law, or
discretionary codes of conduct, which because they are jointly adopted and
supervised, bind member states to certain standards of behaviour.

The making of EMU is a striking example of the adaptation of a major new project to
the underlying realities of this well-established system.

Monetary policy is single and central. The key decisions will however be taken by a
Council in which the governors of the national central banks far outnumber members
of the permanent executive.

Fiscal policy remains firmly in the hands of the member states with the result that
with the exception of a relatively minor sop to Spain in the form of the Maastrict
created Cohesion Fund, the size of the EU's central budget has not been altered with
the approach of Monetary Union. The buck stops therefore with the member states,
which is where, by common consent, the member states want it to stop.

Rules, and more specifically the Stability Pact, will do for EMU what big government
does in the nation states.

If therefore we ask what the impact of EMU will be on the EU's political and
governmental system, the most reasonable expectation must be that the institutions
that we currently have will adapt to the new reality in ways that are consistent with
their present ways of operating. They have indeed already begun to do so.

Politically therefore, as economically, EMU seems likely to mean more of the same
rather than a revolution. All of which is highly relevant to the question concerning its
durability. EMU fits well into the overall political design of the new Europe .This is not
the creation of one, two or even three men. Political leaders played their part. But the
dynamics- and therefore the inherent strengths- of the enterprise are not dependent
on the survival of a few outstanding figures. Every participating state, and even those
that are not yet members, has an immense stake in its survival. The chances are
therefore that it will survive, even if, like every political arrangement, it has to be
adapted to unexpected developments.

Where then, finally, does this leave the British, the Danes and the Swedes who,
unlike the other outsiders, the Greeks, had not made any firm commitment on EMU
membership. The answer is more complex than is sometimes suggested. EMU is,
as this note has argued, so solidly grafted on to an economic and political system of
which the reluctant three are effective and valuable members, that the danger of a
major split in the EU in the short term should not be exaggerated. The outsiders will
not be part of the new EU-11 caucus. They will however be in ECOFIN. Still more to
the point, the insiders have absolutely no interest in pushing, or even allowing, them
to pursue policies that diverge from Euro-norms. In the short term, therefore, the
British and the others will probably suffer no more inconvenience than a small
interest rate premium and the uncomfortable awareness that if they do make
mistakes in macroeconomic management, they are now more directly exposed to
market discipline than any of their EU partners.

So far so good. More significant problems could emerge if entry was postponed
indefinitely. EMU is bound to change the way in which its members view each other
and the outside world. Once Euro coins circulate there will also be an important
psychological impact on the citizens of EMU states. Finally, and by no means least,
EMU is yet another stage in the transformation of power politics within Europe and
beyond. Over time, therefore, the dangers of remaining outsiders will grow rather than
diminish.

These dangers are particularly important for the British, who because of their size
and continuing importance in international relations, have always been more
vulnerable to the political revolution that started in Europe almost fifty years ago. The
events of this week-end demonstrated yet again how far even the pro-EU British
administration of Tony Blair is from understanding EU politics. President Chirac was,
needless to say, the chief culprit. The remark of the Austrian Chancellor that he had
just received a very useful lesson in how not to run a European Council is however an
indicator of how far Blair's own reputation suffered. His EU colleagues are still
fascinated by him. As the Prime Minister of the fourth poorest country in the Union
and an EMU outsider, however, he will have a hard task over the coming months and
years to transform admiration for his style into a willingness to regard him as any
more than an exotic and unreliable half-member of the club.

Goldfly, Your Msg. #708 was a great theatrical read! All the components of a good
drama are revealed as the act unfolds in an opulent tent somewhere in the lost desert.
We need no tickets for this play as this road-show is free and coming to every
neighborhood, soon!---------------------------------------------- Your words:
"WHAT -other than supply and demand- MAKES GOLD VALUABLE? What is so great
about gold?"----------- Well, that question goes deep into a human need for wealth that
represents ones life long efforts. We could ask the same question about houses, cars,
clothes, art work and the like. Hell, people work, they produce and in exchange they want
items and things. These possessions, in a surreal way are part of your life experience.
Humans all die, but before that, we want to see our Stuff??!! They lord over it, protect it
and try to keep others from stealing it.-------------------------- Look at what happened in
Paris when in WW2 the Germans came marching in. You didn't see those boys grabbing
any French currency did you? They took art work in the form of paintings, gold,
diamonds, RARE COINS, collectors items of every nature. What made those Things so
valuable? Besides supply and demand. ------------------Around the same time the American
government was moving much of it's art work out of the White House and storing it in the
Biltmore Estate (the Vanderbilt castle) in North Carolina. Why? Just because they thought
that Washington may be attacked and these National Treasures night be lost? Why were
these Treasures in need of saving but the dollar cash that was used to denominate them
was not? ----------------------------------This takes us right to the heart of the question.
What do you, as a real person see as value, the items or the dollar price that represents
their value? Is it the dollar itself that has the value or is it the "Ability Of The Dollar To
Act AS The Denominator Of The Value Of An Item" that creates the need for this
currency? After thinking a while, most people would answer that it is the Denominator
Action that makes this currency Money! ---------------Moving further along this line of
reasoning: I now ask in another context of your question "What makes dollars so special"?
-----------------------If money derives it's value solely by being an asset denominator for
use in commerce and trade, then why not gold? Indeed, in it's purest form money is any
real thing. When individuals are able to trade with each other using actual items they grow
or produce, nothing is lost in the transaction. Commerce is complete and the trade is final.
Goldfly, you already know the reason gold was used for so many centuries as money. It
being a real thing that could be divided into manageable bits for trade. People came to this
conclusion, perhaps a thousand years ago. It's only the last sixty or so years of paper use,
that modern analysts proclaim as the history of money! They delude the public by not
including the fact that our current new form of paper money has precious little historical
precedent. The facts are that gold works as money and it works very well. Unfortunately,
the modern, high speed world we live and trade in requires ink on paper and digital bits to
extract the efficiency of the system. This is truly to everyone's benefit, for as the earth
becomes more crowded, we need to be efficient in commerce. Gold can and will work
very efficiently in the coming financial framework. It is a money function for the 21st
century that will exploit and expose the wasteful ways of the current financial system.
------------------------------ As I mentioned to someone else, I say to you: We will continue
with a paper money system, it's needed for efficiency and it's necessary in complicated
trade. So do the same as others, get past it and get over it. Many world leaders have come
to the same pragmatic conclusion. That does not mean that gold can not be integrated into
the financial landscape, it will. So, the next time you see gold going down in dollars,
remember, it's just a old currency from the past that will devalue any present money that
fails to properly denominate things. --------------- To answer your question: It is the
history of gold being used as money that makes it special, not the current supply and
demand. In the same way that rare paintings have a history of being useful in the life
experience of humans, so too do we hold a life passion for gold. thanks FOA

SCP, --------- Your question: "Also.... could you add any other thoughts as to why a
strategy that rekindled the boom in '87 will not work today? ---------------------- Plain and
simple, the dollar is very late in the time cycle of paper currencies. Don't confuse this with
some trading cycles you hear about. Throughout out the history of paper currencies (short
as it may be), the few that became world accepted major reserves (British pound?) all
headed downhill only after they reached the maximum in popularity and convertibility.
Once every nation began to issue debt, settle accounts, create reserves and in general, use
this major currency as a proxy for their own, it had reached it's limit of expansion. It is a
natural decline that occurs in fiat reserve currency monetary systems. As sure as the sun
rises in the East, the world moves on, into another money system. We have reached that
level today with the dollar. Everyone expects the dollar world to deflate this currency and
continue it's use in a depression racked world. No doubt, some of the bets placed today by
short sellers of gold involve a deflation read of the current situation. Indeed, we are seeing
the contraction effects of this in many countries. However, we now live in a much more
advanced economic world than in the past. The history of major currency destruction did
not have these factors to deal with. As Aragorn III wrote about platinum in his #612 post:
"The modern use redefined the value accordingly"! Another sent me a commit on it. "A
stunning statement that in this case can also be applied to the dollar of today." How true!
-------------------------- As the Federal Reserve lowers rates, it will, in time, crush the
dollar if an alternative currency is available. It will be and long bond dollar rates will rise
as the result. The world will move on because: " The modern use redefined the value
accordingly"! Thanks FOA

EU Leaders Taking The Activist Route At Summit, New Roles for Community -----------------------------------------


By Barry James International Herald Tribune -----------------------------------------------

BRUSSELS - European leaders had no ready answers on
Monday to the question of how they could bring the European
Union closer to its citizens.

That was supposed to have been the theme of a special summit
meeting in Austria over the weekend, but instead the global
economic crisis dominated the discussions.

Nevertheless, from a meeting that had no formal agenda and
promised no decisions, the conclusion emerged that citizens
expect the EU to do more in some fields, such as creating jobs,
but to interfere less in other areas best left to governments.

Thus a proposal from the president of the European Parliament,
Jose Maria Gil-Robles, for a Europe-wide income tax to pay for
EU institutions went nowhere. Mr. Gil-Robles argued that
Europeans would appreciate Europe more if they paid for it
directly instead of indirectly through their governments and if
they realized that the EU costs each citizen less than the price of
a cup of coffee each day.

But the government heads judged that this was precisely the
kind of idea that was most likely to drive citizens away from the
idea of a united Europe.

The summit meeting opened the way, however, toward closer
economic integration and a more active role for the EU in
common political and security problems, areas where the
leaders judged that Europeans were looking for more decisive
action rather than less. They also decided to work more closely
together in tackling organized crime and illegal immigration,
both issues that were judged of major common interest for
citizens in most European states.

The emergence of a social democrat as chancellor in Germany
and a former Communist as prime minister in Italy was
described by most commentators as a turn to the left. But Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, one of only two
right-of-center leaders in the EU, saw it differently. He said the
conference had shown that the left had moved toward the
center, and that he did not feel in the least isolated.

Europe has until recently been divided between the demand for
strict fiscal austerity to underpin its imminent single currency and
the call by some other countries for a political counterweight to
the new European Central Bank.

The dogmatism appears to be evaporating now that Germany
has a finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who seems equally
attuned to the idea of economic government. Antonio Guterres,
the Portuguese prime minister, said Europe now had a "human
climate" that contrasted with "the experiences of the past."

Some analysts said this development was inevitable. Putting
monetary policy in the hands of the central bank and leaving
fiscal policy in the hands of the governments, they said, was
bound to lead to increasing coordination of economic planning
and perhaps eventually of taxation strategies as well. And the
recessionary wave in much of the world meant that all EU
governments were worried more about deflation than inflation,
they added.

But there are likely to be more questions in future about the
extent to which the bank should operate independently of the
economy. Officials pointed out that even an inflation-fighter like
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve,
took market and economic conditions into account when setting
interest rates.

The leaders also have started to give serious thought to the
question of why Europe is such an economic giant and such a
political pygmy. Britain's decision to drop its long-standing
opposition to giving Europe its own defense capability, so that it
could act independently of the United States in dealing with
security issues in its own area, opens up a whole new area for
debate.

While the Austrian summit issued no documents, it illustrated a
change in thinking that may lead to more specific action on
issues such as job creation, joint public works and the
appointment of a head of foreign and security policy when the
leaders next meet, in Vienna in December. Mr. Gil-Robles
philosophically accepted that it might be many years before his
idea saw the light of day.

2 Bundesbank Officials Reject Rate-Cut Calls
---------------------------------------------
By John Schmid International Herald Tribune

FRANKFURT - Escalating a feud that some German central
bankers fear could complicate the introduction of the euro, the
Bundesbank on Tuesday fired more salvos against the growing
political pressure for lower interest rates.

Two Bundesbank officials, one from each side of the political
spectrum, rejected calls to lower interest rates as a way to
stimulate economic growth. They added their weight to the
arguments of the Bundesbank vice president, Juergen Stark,
who Monday decried the developing "climate of conflict"
between politicans and the politically autonomous European
Central Bank, fearing it would damage the Jan. 1 introduction of
the common currency.

Significantly, one of the Bundesbank board members who
played down any chance of cheaper credit this year was
Hans-Juergen Koebnick, who is a member of the Social
Democratic Party. The Social Democrats, who took the oath of
office Tuesday to head the new leftist German government, have
led calls for lower rates as a way to tackle Europe's persistently
high unemployment.

From the other side of the political spectrum, another
Bundesbank board member, Franz-Christoph Zeitler, insisted
that Bonn's new leaders were misguided in advocating lower
interest rates as a painless economic remedy.

Political leaders "should not create the illusion of being able to
overcome and push aside structural problems with forced
interest rate cuts," Mr. Zeitler told a bankers' conference in
Munich. "A historically low rate level places on us the
responsibility of keeping our powder dry for any crisis-like
development, which is not foreseeable but at the same time
cannot be ruled out."

But a rate cut in response to political pressure "would be poor
use of our firearms," he added.

The latest calls for expansionary economic policies came over
the weekend at a summit meeting of European Union leaders,
where 11 member of the 15-nation bloc now have left-leaning
leaders.

Mr. Stark said on Monday, "Recent calls to loosen the reins of
monetary policy in order to promote employment are just like the
call for a more expansionary fiscal policy - neither is helpful nor
appropriate."

GITIC Bond Default Shakes China Creditors
-------------------------------------------------
Foreign Banks Move to Reassess Exposure
-----------------------------------------------
By Philip Segal International Herald Tribune
----------------------------------------
HONG KONG - One of China's most prominent investment
companies has defaulted on an international bond payment,
banking officials said Tuesday, the first time such a Chinese
company had done so since the Communist revolution in 1949.

At the same time, a new report indicated that Chinese
corporate debt held by overseas banks - largely in Japan and
Europe - might stand at more than double the previous
estimates, even as doubts spread over how much of it would be
repaid.

The default by Guangdong International Trust & Investment
Corp., known as GITIC, immediately raised the question of
whether the Chinese government would stand behind the huge
debts of China's regional investment companies, including
Guangdong, as financial tremors continue to shake Asia and the
growth of China's economy slows.

Guangdong defaulted on an $8.75 million interest payment on a
$200 million bond, according to Joanne Shephard, a Chase
Manhattan Bank spokeswoman. In the past, China has always
repaid foreign loans from shuttered institutions, but Guangdong
is different, possibly heralding a new and much more risky
phase in the financing of China's development.

Since the bankruptcy of Guangdong on Oct. 6, information has
been slow to emerge about the exposure of foreign banks to
China's other international trust and investment companies,
known as ITICs, which are backed by the Chinese government
or by provincial governments to raise money abroad.

Potentially more worrying, however, is the debt of Chinese
companies known as "red chips," which are incorporated in
Hong Kong and quoted on the stock exchange here but
controlled by Beijing. According to a report by Goldman, Sachs
& Co., the red chips may have borrowed more than twice as
much money from overseas banks as was estimated earlier this
month.

"We estimate aggregate debts for major red-chip companies
amount to 100 billion Hong Kong dollars," or $13.35 billion, the
report says

Analysts say that, like the international trusts, red chips have
used a lot of their borrowed money to invest in speculative
real-estate deals and the stock market. Foreign banks have lent
to red chips "without examining credit risks carefully," Goldman
Sachs said. This, the U.S. firm said, was because of a "perhaps
mistaken assumption" that, in the event of cash flow problems,
the government-supported parent companies in China would
"eventually honor the payments."

Goldman added that leading bank lenders to ITICs represented
a "veritable 'who's who' of global banks, including CS First
Boston, Commerzbank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Dresdner Bank,
Sakura Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, SocGen,
Westdeustche Landesbank." It added that according to the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, 80 percent of exposure to the
ITICs was on the part of foreign banks.

The backing of the Guangdong provincial government was once
thought to be enough to guarantee the survival of Guangdong,
but that has been proven wrong, a lesson that could extend to
other ITICs or red chips that run into major financial trouble.

Two clearing houses in Europe - Euroclear of Belgium and
Cedel Bank SA of Luxembourg - said Tuesday that they had
already credited some bondholders and may now revoke those
payments, Bloomberg News reported.

GITIC was famous for its frosty relations with the central
government, one reason analysts believe it was shut down
before any other large ITICs from other provinces. But lenders
who had hoped that Guangdong was a badly managed,
one-of-a-kind company might want to reconsider, analysts said.
After a series of company visits, Mehdee Reza, a Credit Suisse
First Boston banking analyst, said that among Hong Kong's
bankers, "GITIC was perceived as being the most financially
sound" of the ITICs.

Banks from Japan and Germany have been named so far as the
biggest lenders to the international trusts, although according to
Basis Point, a newsletter that monitors credit markets in Asia,
the single most exposed lender to Guangdong might have been
Union Bank of Switzerland AG, which has since merged with
Swiss Bank Corp.

In March 1997, UBS undertook a $205 million floating-rate note
for Guangdong Infrastructure Ltd., which is also controlled by the
government of the southern province of Guangdong.

GITIC acted as a guarantor for that deal, and GITIC itself gave
UBS a mandate in August 1997 to issue a $100 million
five-year note in its name, Basis Point said.

The newsletter's editor, Stewart Man, said Basis Point had
never heard anything further from UBS about the deals, and
UBS declined to comment.

Since GITIC was shut down, two more international trusts from
Guangdong Province have failed to meet interest payments.

One, a company backed by the municipal government of
Guangdong's capital, Guangzhou, failed to make a payment of a
$30 million loan arranged by Societe Generale SA of France.
Like many of the largest lenders to the international trusts,
Societe Generale also loaned a lot of money to red chips and,
according to Goldman Sachs, was one of the principal bankers
of Guangdong Investment.

Another major lender to international trusts is Commerzbank AG
of Germany, which a week ago failed to receive a payment from
another international trust on a $70 million loan

Platinum?
This is an interesting observation. Today, Wed. 28, the Dec. Platinum contract on the
Comex fell $4.50 US to $339.10. I bring this up because of the number of analysis that
use Platinum as the premier supply and demand vehicle. Many have urged it's purchase as
a stand-in for gold. The reason given is the overwhelming demand for commercial use and
it's investment appeal. Yet, with all of these factors firmly in place, it cannot override the
paper currencies markets. Some brokers, recently, cannot obtain the metal at all, let alone
coins and still no rise in price. -----------
What can we gain from this price action? The point is that Platinum and Silver, just like
gold, are also subject to the pressures of a paper money market. However, where gold is a
currency for THESE modern times, the white metals are an almost money created by a
commercial need IN these modern times. -------------------------------- We should
remember that the history of gold as money provides a use far deeper than any other metal
that offers a "good story" and a short past! If we intend to hold a metal for the security of
money, examine it's record of use as a medium of exchange to find it's demand in the
future. Perhaps Platinum will perform as a function of it's modern fundamental supply and
demand. Or, will it in the future, as in all commodities, find a new price in terms of gold?
------We shall see. -------------------------- FOA

The Currency War is Very REAL---------------------------
WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 28 1998 Financial Times - London

--------------------------------------------------------
Junior, ------------- That was a good article! The most important concept to grasp from the
many thoughts about the Euro and the ECB is this:---------- The EMU is going to come
about during a time of a world disorder that heavily impacts the currencies. During this
time, if the USA is engulfed in this economic crisis, it's dollar will be under pressure unlike
anything seen before. With the loss of an anchor currency, gold will naturally receive a
huge influx of demand. However, gold is not a CIRCULATING currency and as such
cannot represent the wealth of nations in this format. Because a non-circulating currency is
held for security and as a reserve, during times of crisis, it's velocity becomes frozen.
------------ This nature was well understood and considered when building the Euro. In
modern times, a currency destruction that leaves only gold as a medium of exchange,
would drive it's real value to infinity, without any means of conducting commerce.
Somewhat the position of Russia today, but without any other world moneys in existence.
For this reason, gold was to be held fast (as much as possible) until the Euro is created.
Even in the heat of an impending currency war, gold does not move. In time, the Euro will
become the transactional currency for gold in a true free market. Gold will increase in
value and as such expand that currency to an extent as to allow it to represent all
commerce. Unlike the American dollar that limits gold as a basis for money expansion, a
rising gold price will expand the Euro for the benefit of all. The future drifting
(contracting) economies will find new life in a "lose" Euro. Lose in terms of a gold
structure, not the current debt structure. Low interest rates will go hand in hand with a
strong free market price of gold. ----------------------- As good money drives out bad, gold
will drive investors into the Euro and away from failing systems. I will expand on this
another day. Thanks FOA

USAGOLD, Thanks for the welcome! Your post # 834 shows the world to be a very

ago that a storm approaches the American shore from across the Pacific! That cold air you
feel in Colorado may have arrived from Japan? The next financial weather storm (also
pointed out by "A") should arrive from the South. South America! ------------------------ It
seems that all of the major US trading partners that rely heavily on financial support from
Washington are in line to sink with the dollar economic system. Their financial support
comes in the form of a large American trade deficit. Even Japan, with it's major currency,
the Yen, must have a trade surplus in dollars to prevent a political and economic
breakdown. Everyone thinks the Japanese will just sell their dollar reserves and begin a
new reserve currency or buy gold. They may try, but Industrial Japan is built to sell! It is
not their culture to buy and consume. This same culture is prevalent in all of the major
third world economies that live to export to the USA. They will keep their currencies
below the dollar even if it means riding the ship down, so to speak. --------------------------
However, it is this very action of selling to the dollar that now so aggravates and speeds
the destruction of this currency. The world is close to the limit now as country after
country comes to Washington and asks for a larger share of the US market. A market that
may not exist soon? ---------------------------------------------- As in my other post, I will

Gandalf, ----------- Your words: ---- "could you please give us YOUR opinion on the
direction of the POP related to the POG, and WHY ?" --------------------------
Platinum, today, is a good investment. And, as a thinly traded, rare metal, it will always be
attractive as a portfolio holding. It will also rise in price in paper money terms. The
problem is that many people have been sold on the idea that it is a substitute for holding
gold. Much of this analysis comes from it's past price history in dollar terms. During this
short time, (twenty years?) Platinum sometimes held a premium to Gold. Some sharp
operators use this history, combined with a good story, to offer that Platinum will always
appreciate faster than gold and hold it's premium. ----------- I submit that that was
yesterday's news. The demand for this metal, as represented in today's offtake, is all there
is. No hidden demand, no coming change in use and no future demand as a function of
money. No entity is building a stock of Platinum because it will be used to back a currency
or be used as an official coinage (Russian Gold Coins? Islamic Dinar? Gold Euro?). It has
a commodity demand as a rare metal used in a modern application. In this limited use, if
it's value rises, more metal will be found to supply the industrial need. The total possible
forward demand is not that overwhelming when the commodity use is the only true
offtake. Yes, coin demand is part of offtake, but these coins in private hands must be
viewed as only another form of industrial supply storage in the event of greater need. Will
this function create a higher price? Of course, but a higher price in terms of a typical
investment in commodities. No More! With this in mind, I do own Platinum.
------------------ As for Gold, the same operators that push for a total commit in Platinum,
often make the mistaken point that the large stockpile of world Gold has no large
commercial demand basis. Therefore, as the holders of this metal realize that this Gold will
take fifty years for Jewelry demand to absorb, they are rushing to unload it before it goes
to $50 US or less! This is a good point if you are selling a leveraged idea to a customer
with a limited background of reference to the history of money. This offers a possible
client base encompassing the entire Western world (Except for those that have read Mr.
Kosares's ABCs). ----------------------- At present prices, the entire stock of world gold (I
said Entire Stock) could be sold to persons / nations that wish to remove themselves from
a collapsing dollar debt financial system. At lower prices still, even a smaller handful of
investors would take it all. The purpose of this buying would not be to take advantage of
the commodity / jewelry demand of gold. The advantage expressed in the buying of gold is
presented as: ------ transferring your wealth into a historic vehicle that has performed the
function of "a medium of exchange" and done so in time cycles that outlive civilizations!
Obviously, this forward type of thinking involves motives that take into consideration the
long-term transfer of wealth within a family. Not a daytrade! ------------Gandalf, this my
friend, is the kind of motivation that creates real demand for a substance. A type of human
need that is not presented on charts and cannot be explained in a leveraged brokers office.
This kind of historic demand for real money will reassert itself soon and will dwarf all
possible supply, in ground and above. It is possible that in the future, one ounce of Gold
equivalent will be commonly used to purchase twenty ounces of Platinum. ------------
Perhaps a good ratio for investment? Thanks FOA

clouds our vision concerning the future. Seldom do our kings and elected leaders plot a
true course that avoids the long-term destruction of wealth. One does never wish for their
assets to be denominated in the currency of a foreign nation. It is in this very fear that so
many investors find the reoccurring cycle of a common world currency, Gold. It belongs
to no national entity and yet it's value as an exchange medium is held endearing
throughout history. ------------------ Currencies come, are brought to their limits of debt,
lose (correct word Mr. G.?) the usefulness of exchange from the fraudulent imposition of
exchange intervention and are discarded by people. Look to Brazil, Mexico, Asia and we
see that no government can force fiat money to hold value. These people adjust there by
using dollars as the lesser of two evils. In America, you will also view the currency of gold
as the choice of necessity. -------------------------- As we make this journey through life,
the fading dollar will be but another financial obstacle the world must scramble around in
it's quest to move on. The Euro is the future, bungling bureaucrats and all, and gold will
be the anchor. No brand new currency reserve system has ever evolved without Gold and
the Euro will be no different. This colossal change in evaluating wealth will destroy so
many assets that gold will be forced into a center stage with this new paper currency.
Avoid it? We will not. Far too many conservative entities will not risk their children's /
nations future on the Old Europe Order without the Old World Order of Gold as
insurance. ----------- We play an old game in modern times, a game many have never

PH, -------------- Thank you for the compliment of my old post in your old post. I would
like to reply to your question also. ---- Your words: --- "Would you care to comment as
to why the worldwide debt as denominated in dollars was allowed to cease to expand at
this time (late 1980s)?" --------------Even in today's engineered society, it is the interaction
of human wants and desires that make the world turn. In the simplest of terms, modern fiat
currencies are created through borrowing (the creation of debts as assets) by individuals.
When enough debt is created that all assets have been borrowed against, the borrowing,
on a net basis, no longer expands the currency. With the currency no longer functioning as
an economic expansion tool, it's most useful reason for existence is lost. In this stage, the
federal treasuries and CBs no longer have the power to control their money. The
government response concerning local money, takes on the function of only lowering
interest rates to protect the economy / banking system. Later this function is transformed
by necessity to raising rates to protect whatever viability the money has in the open
market. ------------ As you made mention about Japan, we also see this. They lowered
rates to almost zero during the local economic protection stage, and will at some time
begin to raise rates to protect the Yen as their economic dependence on the dollar drags
them down. ------------------- In this light we can see that entities such as the US Federal
Reserve have little power to maneuver during the last days of their currencies time life.
This cycle that began during the late 1980s was not a "created" event, but rather an
inevitable transition. At first the local equities markets explode, only to be followed by an
even greater contraction that usually traps investors in bad positions. The final run into a
world class money, gold, usually leaves all paper investors with thoughts of "how could I
have been so blind"! It seems that young people grow into an new world of finance that
always returns to the lost world of simple sensibilities. thank you, PH FOA

Brasilia Sees Problem on Tax

BRASILIA - Brazil's Congress should approve the bulk of the
government's fiscal austerity plan, but there might be opposition
to a key tax increase on many financial transactions, the leader
of the lower house, Michel Temer, said Thursday.

Members of Congress were expecting an increase in the tax
rate to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent, but the $84 billion fiscal
austerity plan unveiled Wednesday would push the rate up to
0.38 percent.

"There isn't resistance to an extension nor to an increase to 0.3
percent, but rather against the extra rise of 0.08 percent," Mr.
Temer said.

Financial markets in Brazil were downbeat on the prospects for
the austerity plan, which was introduced Wednesday and is a
prerequisite for an international rescue package. The
benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 288.11 points, or 4.22
percent, to 6,538.40.

Fund managers predict euro will rival dollar

The euro, its proponents claim, will change everything. Companies are starting to merge and reorganise on that premise or promise. Many of the changes so far have been tentative. But at least in one area, a radical reorganisation is underway. It could have a large impact on the character of the Europe's single capital market. Global fund managers now believe the euro will be a strong currency in relation to the US dollar and will soon rival the dollar as the preferred currency for debt issuance.
These findings, contained in a report issued by Deutsche Bank today, stem from the largest survey yet conducted on global investor views on Europe's future single currency.
Investors were worried that a broad European monetary union, which included Spain and Italy, would mean a weak euro," said Ifty Islam, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. However, this view has altered sharply.
Economists say the change in attitude towards the euro has come with the realisation that the euro zone will have a large structural trade surplus - estimated at $100bn, or 1.5 per cent of the euro zone's gross domestic product.
The US, by contrast, is expected to record a trade deficit of about $140bn in 1998. Italy and Spain regularly post trade surpluses, indicating their membership of the first wave of Emu could help strengthen the exchange value of the future single currency.
In addition, the European Central Bank is expected to take a more hawkish stance on inflation than the US Federal Reserve, implying that monetary policy will be tighter in the euro zone than in the US, according to Deutsche Bank.
A total of 193 global funds, including a number of central banks, took part in the survey, representing $7,500bn worth of funds, or about 25 per cent of total worldwide funds.
A large majority of US fund managers, with collectively almost $2,000bn worth of funds under management, said the euro would have a strong exchange value the US dollar.
In addition, 73 per cent of the investors polled, including a majority of US fund managers, said the euro would rival the US dollar as the preferred currency for debt issuance within five years.
As central banks are among the main investors in bonds, this implies that the euro could also rival the US dollar as a reserve currency by 2003. At the moment, about 50 per cent of all international bonds are denominated in US dollars, compared with about 25 per cent in euro zone currencies.
The report suggests, however, that the growth of a broad, US-style corporate bond market in Europe could take longer than many have anticipated.
More than 50 per cent of the funds polled, of which about half were located within the euro zone, said regulations prevented them from buying securities rated below single A by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, the rating agencies

THE ECONOMIST: "the euro mightdrive down the dollar by 40%"

EURO BRIEF
The international euro

The euro will, at a stroke, become the world's
second-biggest currency. But, as the fifth in our
series of briefs explains, it is less clear whether
and when it might challenge the dollar's
dominant role in the world financial system
















UNTIL recently, few outside Europe paid any
attention to the euro. American policymakers
maintained a conspicuous silence, commenting only
that what was good for Europe was good for
America. Asians were too preoccupied with their
own crises to worry about a new currency half a
world away. And Europeans themselves were too
concerned with the mechanics of the single currency
to think about its international impact.

Partly as a result, there is remarkably little consensus
on what that impact will be—and even less on how to
respond to it. The one certainty is that the euro will
immediately be a major international currency, second
only to the dollar. It is striking that, in economic and
financial terms, the euro-11 countries are a close
match for the United States. Their combined GDP in
1997 was $6.5 trillion, compared with America's
$8.1 trillion. Their share of international trade outside
the euro area (19%) is a shade larger than that of the
United States (17%). Taken together, bond markets
in euro countries are somewhat smaller than
America's—although Europe's equity markets are
much smaller than Wall Street.




The dollar's role
in international
finance is,
however, far
bigger than
America's
relative weight
would suggest. It
is the main
currency used for
the world's trade
and investment. Roughly half of world trade is
invoiced in dollars. Almost all commodities are priced
in dollars. According to a recent survey by the Bank
for International Settlements, the dollar features in at
least one side of 87% of all foreign-exchange
transactions, the D-mark in 30%, and other
euro-member currencies in only 24%.

Although the dollar's share of international bond
issuance has fallen substantially since the early 1980s,
over 50% of international notes and bonds are still in
dollars, compared with 28% for the combined euro
countries. Bank lending shows the same dollar
preponderance: 45% of cross-border loans are
dollar-denominated (see chart 1).

Almost half the world's foreign-held bank deposits
are in dollars. The dollar's weight in private
international transactions also makes it the currency of
choice for countries’ official reserves. In 1997 some
57% of the world's reserves were in dollars, though
the greenback's share has fallen in the past two
decades (see chart 2).

America derives several benefits from the dollar's
dominant international role. There is, first of all, the
profits to the state from its monopoly issue of notes
and coins. Seignorage from dollars held abroad may
be worth some 0.1% of American GDP.

The dollar's predominance in bond markets also gives
America a "liquidity discount" on government debt.
The liquidity of the bond market allows the Treasury
to pay a lower premium to buyers. Richard Portes of
the London Business School and Helene Rey of the
London School of Economics have estimated that this
discount is worth between 25 and 50 basis points
(hundredths of a percentage point). Given that
non-residents hold about $2 trillion of American
government debt, that implies an annual saving of $5
billion-10 billion, similar to the gains from dollar
seignorage.

The third and perhaps biggest advantage that America
gains from the dollar's dominance is the ability to
finance its current-account deficits in its own currency.
Charles de Gaulle famously complained that the
exorbitant privilege of the dollar "enabled the United
States to be indebted to foreign countries free of
charge." In fact America pays interest on all the
government debt it issues. Yet de Gaulle had a point,
even so. America might have far more difficulty
running huge current-account deficits if the dollar were
not the international currency of choice.

Euro challenger

At the very least, the arrival of the euro might threaten
America's ability to continue reaping such benefits.
But is it also possible that Europe could start to take
them for itself? That depends in the first place on how
quickly the euro's international role will grow. And the
answer to that will also go a long way to answering a
related question: will the euro be a strong or weak
currency? In particular, will it appreciate or depreciate
against the dollar?

Economists considering these questions fall into two
camps. In one are the enthusiasts, who reckon that
the euro will be a strong and stable currency that will
rapidly challenge the dollar's predominance, largely
because investors will diversify their portfolios into
euros. They also think this will happen quickly—in line
with the speed of today's international capital
markets.

In the other camp are the sceptics, who think the euro
will need to establish a track record before investors
move into it. They also reckon that inertia, for instance
in reserve diversification, could benefit the dollar for
several decades. They point to the lessons of history:
sterling maintained its status as a globally dominant
currency long after Britain's economic hegemony was
over.

Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for
International Economics, is the most prominent
American enthusiast for the euro. He expects the
European Central Bank to pursue a tight monetary
policy. He also expects investors, and central banks,
to shift a substantial part of their assets out of dollars
and into euros, commensurate with the euro area's
relative economic weight.

Ultimately, Mr Bergsten thinks that around 30-40%
of world financial assets will be denominated in euros,
with 40-50% denominated in dollars, and the rest in
yen and smaller currencies such as the Swiss franc
and sterling. Such a portfolio shift could imply a
one-off transfer of between $500 billion and $1 trillion
into euros. And if that happens as fast as Mr Bergsten
expects, it will push the euro up against the dollar.

Mr Portes and Ms Rey are also enthusiasts, though
their analysis differs from Mr Bergsten's. They argue
that a key determinant of the euro's future significance
will be the transaction costs of using the euro in
foreign-exchange and securities markets. As Europe's
capital and securities markets integrate, becoming
deeper and more liquid, these transaction costs will
fall. Lower costs will make investment in the euro
more attractive, in turn increasing volume, further
reducing costs, and so on.

Lower transaction costs in foreign-exchange markets
will also increase the euro's attraction as a currency
for denominating trade. If there are further institutional
changes in Europe's financial markets, and if Britain,
which has better developed capital markets than the
continent, joins the euro, the two economists reckon
that the euro could easily challenge the dollar—and
again, that the challenge could come quite fast.

The sceptics’ case

How realistic are these claims? Many economists,
particularly in central banks, are sceptical. They point
out that the euro is still untried, and that markets will
need time before they trust it as a stable store of
value. More important, investors have historically
shown a "home bias" in their portfolio allocation. For
a net portfolio shift towards the euro to occur, foreign
investors must hold more assets in euros than they did
in its constituent currencies.

Nor is a single capital market entirely guaranteed. As
Peter Kenen of Princeton University points out, a
single currency does not mean that Europe's bond
markets will become completely unified. Although the
euro will eliminate intra-European exchange-rate risk,
it does not mean that German and Italian bonds
become perfect substitutes. Differences in default risk
and tax treatment will mean that individual bond
markets remain segmented—though to the extent that
they are less so than now, the euro may still gain.

Sudden shifts in official reserve holdings are also
unlikely, despite the disproportionate size of the euro
area's own reserves. Once the euro is introduced, the
national central banks of the euro area will hold
relatively high stocks of foreign reserves that they will
no longer need because much of what is now
"external" trade will become intra-euro trade.
Estimates of these "excess" reserves range from $50
billion to $230 billion. Central banks will at some
point want to reduce these.

Other non-euro central banks (which hold a total of
some $775 billion of dollar reserves) might also want
to hold more euros and fewer dollars. If official dollar
reserves were sold suddenly, there would clearly be
downward pressure on the dollar; but central bankers
will surely want to avoid doing anything to destabilise
currency markets, so they are likely to move slowly.
In any case, official dollar holdings are small
compared with America's overall international assets
and liabilities, which, according to the IMF, are of the
order of $3.5 trillion and $4 trillion respectively. What
really matters, therefore, is the behaviour of private
investors.

The relationship between portfolio adjustment and the
euro's exchange rate is complicated. In theory, if
private demand for new euro assets matched the
supply from governments and firms that will borrow in
euros, there might be no effect at all. In practice,
however, a substantial exchange-rate effect can be
expected—mainly thanks to the pattern of
current-account deficits and surpluses between
America and Europe.

If demand for euro assets comes from outside
Europe, the resulting inflow of capital to the region
means that it would have to shift from today's huge
current-account surplus (1.8% of euro area GDP in
1997) to a big deficit to accommodate it. America, in
turn, would be forced to trim radically its
current-account deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 1997. Such
a swing would probably be engineered by a huge
change in exchange rates, with the euro rising sharply
against the dollar. Moreover, if the demand for euro
assets then rose faster than their supply, the euro
would continue to appreciate. To give some idea of
magnitudes, Mr Portes and Ms Rey have suggested
that a portfolio shift of $700 billion into the euro might
drive down the dollar by 40%. Such a change would,
to put it mildly, have a big impact on the global
economy.

The European Central Bank's monetary policy (and
also the fiscal policies of euro member governments)
will, of course, influence both the demand for the euro
and its price. So the biggest question of all is: will the
ECB, which has a treaty obligation only to pursue price
stability, take much notice of the euro's exchange
rate? Like America and Japan, the euro area will be a
relatively closed economy: external trade will account
for a mere 10% of GDP. It may be tempting for the
Europeans to mimic the "benign neglect" that they
have often accused the Americans of following for the
dollar. Indeed, some economists think that, with the
world's two major currencies concentrating
exclusively on domestic goals, currency instability
might increase.

Hence, perhaps, the renewed calls for more formal
international co-ordination. At its simplest, this might
mean no more than closer co-operation among the
main currency blocks—the dollar, the euro and the
yen. But there have also been calls for "target zones"
for the euro and other currencies—most recently
suggested by Germany's new finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, in talks with his French opposite number,
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, though the motivation of
both men seems to be to ensure that the euro does
not appreciate too far rather than a sudden conversion
to the notion of target zones for the good of the world
economy.

Formal exchange-rate targets seem infeasible, even if
some co-ordination between the world's major
currencies might be desirable. For one thing, it is hard
to see them working for the euro, given the confusion
over responsibility for it in international arenas (see
article). Nonetheless, a lesson of the 1930s is that the
existence of two semi-dominant currencies (in that
case, the pound and the dollar) can be destabilising.
Third countries, in particular, can suffer from large
currency swings. The challenge facing the Europeans
(and others) will be to harness the benefits of their
increasingly important new currency, while at the
same time minimising the risk of any such negative
global consequences.

Thoughts!
All:-------------------------------------- I received this E-mail from USAGOLD with thoughts and questions. To this I will
reply and more. -------------------------------------
Mr. PH in LA, you write: "I find myself wondering how much of your understanding is
based on hard knowledge and/or how much on supposition"?--------------------------------------------
Sir, in the course of human
affairs, it is a mistake to accept "intentions to act" as "hard fact or hard knowledge". The books of history are well written of our society as they make plans to travel in one
direction only to find a better path as time progresses. No leader or king has ever made a
decision that is not questioned or perhaps changed after enacted. Your own congress does
make the laws, only to change them for the better as thoughts intertwine!
In matters of finance, law and defense, orderly conduct requires a plan of action weather it be correct or
not. This is the social way our peoples require, yes? Government without a plan that is
accepted as "hard knowledge" by all does lead to chaos. As you consider this, I continue:
My "Thoughts" make supposition of the "hard knowledge" I possess, for with many years I know well the plans that are made! But, as written here, "as the course is set, it remains
for the captains of state to sail the ship through stormy seas, even as the port of call
remains the same". My years also know well how far from plan we (governments) do
often blow.

Even the Mr. Duisenberg does plan the straight path for what will become our world money. It is a good path, with order, yet he knows and I know how hard the winds of war can blow! I ask you Mr. PH, when you build your financial house at the waters
edge, do you accept as "hard fact" from a human builder his knowledge of the "true tide height"? Is it not the better choice to add "supposition" to this "hard knowledge" and build higher and stronger, with gold?

A currency war does approach that will bring wind and water into any house built on the dollar shore. The "captains of state" know this storm
is coming, but to present it as "hard knowledge" to those with a wealth foundation that may not be moved, is of little purpose.

Much of Western wealth is built this way. It will belost, without contest!

My Thoughts are for those of simple ways and worth, for their homes are small and easy to move. These persons are, and always have been "the wealth
of nations". This new Economic Ship will survive the storm, and indeed sail into it's finalport.
In that day the wealth of nations will remain intact by the actions of governments and people that trusted only gold!

ANOTHER (11/13/98; 10:30:01MDT - Msg ID:972)
THOUGHTS!
Mr. PH, your writing continues: ------------------------
"It has often struck me that a very important linchpin to your
scenario of a Euro poised to take over the dollar's reserve
currency status is the certainty that the major Middle Eastern oil
producers are committed to exporting to full capacity at real prices (in
Euros) in direct competition with the United States' insistence on
higher prices for protection of their strategic oil production capacity."

Sir, you may research for all of your days and never find a paper currency
that lasted without the commodity backing. During most of the past,
currencies were backed with gold. It was during your 1970s that a new
backing was found, oil! The removal of gold as backing for the US dollar
brought about the unified acceptance of pricing crude oil in dollars only. It
was considered, in that time, that the "free market" pricing of gold would
allow the dollar to be devalued in gold terms so as to represent a fair formula
(in percentage) to exchange dollars for oil. In this way, the commerce of oil
would create a demand for dollar use and as such the store of value as
contained in crude would represent the backing. As gold would replace any
lost resource of pumped reserves, the currency could be exchanged for metal
if new replacement reserves were not found. A plan, as such. However, other
motives lie behind the removal of gold from the dollar. Had oil been allowed
to stay at the low "gold backed dollar" price, all production would eventually
come from the large middle eastern reserves. Not the good strategic plan for
the US for reserves in that land required the much higher dollar price for
production. Thus the plan above was formulated and the OPEC Cartel
worked much to the surprise of many! It allowed a high dollar price for world
crude while retaining a commodity backing for the currency. Producers could,
if they wish, use dollars created from positive balance of payments to buy
gold at fair rates of exchange. The late 1980s show how the gold market was
allowed to run wild, without order. As you say, the trap door was shut! The
days of the dollar were now numbered as the European market worked to
begin a new currency. They were hurt badly by the run up in oil prices that
was not of their making. If a new Euro could be created that retained the
backing of gold in another format, oil prices could be lowered back into
Middle Eastern reserve production requirements. (I have written of this
before, please see my Thoughts!) These reserves are much larger than
discussed and can easily supply the world at lower prices. As you consider
this I add: The formation of the Euro is a return to the Old European World
Order with gold as the currency backing. And cheap oil is the agent that will
allow the shift to complete. It could never be presented as such for it would
break the financial system before a replacement was ready. The "hard
Knowledge" of lost oil production in the US due to low Euro prices will
destroy the American economy and wealth system as you know it. Also, the
loss of the ability for the US to sell debt in a native currency at low rates will
bring a credit destruction much the same as visited upon Asia. My friend, the
intent of producers is not to flood the world with oil, rather to change the way
it be priced. The natural effect will see the oil advantage for Europe and every
nation that does embraces that currency as a reserve. You will not see this
written but will feel the effects as they unfold. It will impact every equity and
currency market, worldwide. I have more to discuss of this. Thank You!

January?
FOA NOTE: Reuters and Associated Press did not offer this portion of Mr. Duisenberg's speach at the Economic Club! I think that January could be the flash point?
----------------------------------------------------------

DUISENBERG: EURO MAY ACCELERATE CUT IN DLR SHARE IN
PORTFOLIOS

FRANKFURT (MktNews) - European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
said again Thursday that the introduction of the euro in January could potentially
accelerate the on-going shift out of dollar-denominated assets held in private
portfolios.

Duisenberg, in a speech a month ago, said that one could not rule out a sharp
rise of the euro's value against the dollar in January as investors diversified their
holdings into assets valued in the new single European currency.

In the text of a speech to the Economics Club of New York made available here
ahead of delivery, Duisenberg noted that EMU was likely to eliminate the
segmentation of the European bond markets caused by use of differing currencies
and thus produce a broader range of bonds that meet uniform market standards.

"In this context, it is interesting to note that between 1981 and 1995 the share of
EU currencies in worldwide private portfolios is estimated to have risen from 13%
to 37%, while the U.S. dollar's share fell from 67% to 40%," he continued.

"Although this process has slowed down somewhat in the 1990s, I would
expect the introduction of the euro to lead to a continuation of this trend and,
potentially, to accelerate it again," he said.

Duisenberg did not say how this shift would affect the euro-dollar exchange
rate.

THOUGHTS!
Mr. Kosares, thank you for your words. From your post of ( USAGOLD
(10/31/98; 21:07:54MDT - Msg ID:870)), I will reply. Always, it was the
intentions of the BIS for China to join the Euro world. That country is the
"key of Asia", for it does "lock or unlock" all economies on the Pacific.
America did make the great wager that the little nations of this region would
grow large and the Japan would rule this commerce. All of this for the benefit
of keeping the dollar in trade, yes? Now "The Bank" has broken Japan as
they laid upon them rules of adequate financial dealings! These new rules of
engagement find that "noble house" as a ship that sinks with a dollar cargo.
This one ship will remove the entity of the "American Pacific Order".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please consider this meeting: "11th July 1998 The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) today opened its Representative Office for Asia and the
Pacific in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China.
The office will serve as a regional center for the activities of the BIS in Asia.
Through the establishment of its first representative office, the BIS aims to
strengthen further the relations between the BIS and central banks and
monetary authorities in the
region, to improve the exchange of information and data, to facilitate the
organization of meetings and seminars and to contribute generally to
cooperation among central banks and
monetary authorities. The BIS has previously operated only from its
headquarters in Basle, Switzerland."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the Euro makers offer the China a path to travel that does not bring the
curse of dollar holdings. This day we see the beginnings of the "orient
express" on modern tracks. It will carry the cargo of trade that creates the
"independent economy" of Europe! Combine the oil of Babylon with the
peoples of China, then add the finance of the "Old World" and we perceive a
"New Order" of world commerce. Yes, we the China to the Euro "WITH
GOLD"!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please consider as this was written after the BIS meeting : " Wednesday
brought some renewed strength on recommendations that China should
increase its
gold reserves. Liu Shanen, vice director of the
Gold Economic Development and Research
Institute of the State Metallurgical Industry Bureau,
recommended that the People's Republic should
increase its gold reserves from the current level of
397 tonnes or 3% of total foreign exchange
reserves of $140.5 billion to between 1,000 and
1,500 tonnes, between 6% and 8% of external
reserves, "to prevent financial risk." The reasoning
behind this recommendation is apparently the
belief that China should cut its holdings of
dollar-denominated foreign reserves to guard
against a possible fall in the dollar on the
introduction of the Euro, the single European
currency, at the beginning of next year. China
currently holds about 60% of its external reserves
in US dollar-denominated assets, including about
$60 billion in US Treasury bonds. "Compared with
cash, gold is stable and safe," Liu Shanen said.
He also recommended that the Chinese
government should ease controls on buying and
selling by individuals in a bid to boost what he
described as "non-governmental" reserves. Liu
Shanen pointed out that China ranks third in
global consumption of gold and fifth in mine
production, but only twelfth in terms of its official
reserves in gold."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some still say that the new Europe will sell gold. I say, these are words that
many wish for! Even the Poland does buy gold that will soon sell at $200US?
I have known these people well, they be no fools for London stories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please consider these words of Mr. Milling Stanley: "
"Moreover, member countries of the ECB have been firm in telling
the world that they intend to go on holding gold in their individual
central banks too. Germany, France and Italy - three of the largest
holders of gold in the world - have made it clear they have no
intention of selling."

"Europe's politicians and central bankers are convinced that
Europe's gold will be a vital factor in underpinning the
credibility of the ECB's new monetary unit, the euro, which
they envisage as a reserve currency strong enough to stand alongside
the dollar."

Mr. jinx44,
it has always been the battle fought by many, this keeping of

money. Before this new value is found, the governments will reach
for the "greatest vault of gold", as such, it is "the great vault in the

I think, you know not the modern mind of your leaders. They will

Morgan Stanley arm to launch euro index

By Edward Luce and Vincent Boland

Morgan Stanley Capital International, the
global index provider, today launches a
bond index for Europe's future single
currency.

It joins a growing number of big US
investment banks hoping to establish the
benchmark index for bond investment in
the euro.

Salomon Smith Barney, which provides the
leading global bond index, has also
recently launched a euro-denominated
index. Other competitors are J.P. Morgan,
Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.
Barclays Capital is the only European
bank to offer an index for the future
euro-denominated bond market.

Bankers say Europe's traditionally
conservative investor base is gradually
attuning itself to tracking broad
benchmark indices in bond markets. The
idea is more firmly rooted in equity
markets.

"The big fund managers have increasingly
to justify their performance to
investors," said Peter Harlow, director
of fixed income at Barclays Capital.
"Tracking an index is an obvious way of
doing so."

The big banks hope to mirror US markets
where investors closely follow bond
indices, including benchmarks for
high-yield bonds and for the mainstream
investment grade market.
MSCI hopes its euro credit index will
generate business in over-the-counter
derivatives.

Investors often enter into total return
swaps on indices. They pay a floating
rate of interest plus a spread to cover
administration fees in exchange for
receiving the equivalent return generated
from an index over a given period. This
saves investors directly investing in
bonds covered by the index.

However, some investors say investment
banks have overstated the growth
potential of the bond market in euros.
Although with an estimated capitalisation
of E3,000bn ($3,500bn) Europe's bond
market is almost as large as the US
market, it is considerably less liquid.

Unlike the US market, which has a strong
corporate presence, the European market
will be heavily skewed towards government
bonds. Some banks, such as Barclays, have
confined their indices to these.

There is also intense competition to
provide the benchmark equity market
index. Surveys of fund managers and
pension funds suggest MSCI is the most
widely-used pan-European benchmark
provider, but indices provided by Dow
Jones and FTSE International, partly
owned by the Financial Times, are also
gaining ground.

consumers attempt to head off millennium
bomb problems, according to Rudolf Wolff,
the commodity trading subsidiary of
Noranda, Canada's biggest natural
resources group.

Industry worldwide will build stocks
before 2000, "switching from just-in-time
to just-in-case inventory", Martin
Squires, a Wolff analyst suggests.

The millennium bomb refers to problems
that are already beginning to arise
because older computers are unable to
recognise the date change from 1999 to
2000.

Mr Squires says a mining company not
completely certain that its mine - or
power supplier - is year 2000 compliant
would be unlikely to allow employees into
potentially dangerous areas.

THOUGHTS!
Mr. Young,
In the 1990s many investors did lose site of the reality of gold. These
persons heard the call of "stock brokers and leveraged metal sellers" as they
offered gold as "the investment" not "gold the world currency". Western
citizens purchased small amount of real metal, then proceeded to expand
return with paper gold. As such, they rode the back of an "unbroken
Arabian"! This "investment" represented the "wild side" of gold in the form
of paper money. Paper gold was offered as real gold in the modern day
perspective. Perhaps, it be the sophisticated way to impress ones piers,
socially. These same did make the great gains, only to return these same into
the fire of "trading". Your mind, it does also record these moves, yes?
I submit, that real gold, held as a currency, has acted no more or less than
many other paper moneys, both major and minor. Open your charts of past
fluctuations in currency markets, view them all. Behold how the currencies
are "volatile" with some movements of greater scope than gold. Some traders
debate with the ears of clients that gold is not used as money "anywhere"!
And therefore, it is not money, but a commodity for the trading. In this aspect,
investors have lost much wealth to the commission of brokers that trade only
metal and have no understanding of world banking of currencies. For the gold
is a currency that, today, is used to buy and sell other currency, not goods and
services! As such it be the "money of moneys". Small investors of simple
means will do well indeed to hold the gold, in good measure, next to the
native currency they possess. In time, this gold will far exceed any other
wealth held by their family.
The "Yellowbird, Truthseeker and others that "think thru these Thoughts"
will find no "claws of other motives" in this mind.

Mr. Young, with respect, if you find me crazy: I offer " bring before me the
lion that so devours my house, for this beast produces more than it destroys
------ strange pronouncements are these as the lamb in our garden has eaten
our only food"

Sir, continue on with you present flock and do count your wealth today, for
the ones with THESE crazy thoughts will compare wealth with you
tomorrow. Your days be well, Thank You

THOUGHTS!
Mr. Truthseeker (#988),
In the past, the US government did take in gold for the purpose to "restore
the dollar banking system". The laws were changed for this purpose. Today,
the US will "defend the dollar system" from "change"! This is the large
difference, yes? Understand, that the present dollar world would continue if
no "alternative currency was presented". In this circumstance, a move to
"price all international trade in partial payment with gold" would ensue. Such
would not be good for the world economy or Europe.
To this end, a Euro is created that will allow the "freemarket price of gold"
to destroy the dollar once this alternative is in place. In time, in actual buying
power, gold will rise in Euros but will soar in dollars!
Do consider that for the defense of dollar reserve system, the US political
motives will develop as such: "For citizens to change savings reserves from
dollars to Euro will be the "un-American thing" and "It will be better to hold
dollars or even gold than Euros".

Sir, for a time gold will increase in value faster that the Euro will appreciate
against the dollar. In this way many will move to gold thereby blocking the
escape of foreign dollar holders into metal. It is the "tradeoff" of
"encouraging gold buying domestically" against the "blocking of movement
in foreign dollars". Many dollar reserve banks will "freeze from buying" gold
in the false thought that it will return to lower prices. The dollar will slowly
plunge against any "Euro reserve currency economy".

With this I continue for Mr. SIOP (#989),
In time all native American oil production will become "uneconomic" even
as the dollar price of oil does proceed into the hundreds! This be seen as the
simple understanding because the coming dollar cost inflation does render
even this price as "too low"! However, oil in the hard Euro nations will
become even cheaper, creating much lower costs of production for goods and
services. It is the action of "backing the Euro with oil" by "requirement of
settlement in that currency" that will allow Europe to live as the "American
Life"!
Perhaps, had the US allowed the dollar price of gold to increase in the early
70s and accepted Middle Eastern oil production as Europe does today, none
of this would have happened. However, the America would have received
much of the hardship that Japan receives today as the result. Still, seldom do
we find the voluntary destruction of over extended industry in today's world.
Always, it is in the "end of currency system" that loss is inflicted. A different
time we journey thru, yes? A history lived by your parents parents. We relive
old history with new eyes, as gold is held in a different light. Thank You

Euro defence firms aim at integration---------------------

Europe's leading aerospace firms have agreed in
a report submitted to their Governments yesterday
to try to consolidate the industry by forming an
integrated European defence group, France's
Aerospatiale said.
The confidential report by Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa),
Italy's Alenia, Casa of Spain and Sweden's Saab
pushes the European industrial project forward
amid speculation that BAe and Dasa were planning
to go ahead with a two-way deal.
Europe's fragmented defence industry is under
pressure to consolidate rapidly to compete with the
US sector, which began the process years ago and
has created such giants as Boeing-McDonnell
Douglas and Lockheed-Martin.
But the process has been slowed by
disagreements – notably a reluctance by the British
and German groups to merge with state-owned
Aerospatiale and end up as part of a big outfit in
which the French state would have a major holding.
The European companies said in a joint statement,
released by Aerospatiale, that they had reached "a
wide measure of agreement" on several issues.
"They all have confirmed that a unified, integrated
European Aerospace and Defence Company
(EADC) is the right target structure, as already
proposed by the Airbus Partners," it said.
Aerospatiale, Casa (Construcciones
Aeronauticas), Dasa and BAe are members of the
Toulouse-based Airbus commercial plane
consortium. It is scheduled to become a joint stock
company next year and would serve as the
foundation for an integrated civil and defence
aeronautics group.
The companies said the report also addressed "the
question of government rights and safeguards in
EADC" but did not elaborate.
A spokeswoman for Aerospatiale declined to say
more.
A spokesman for the French Defence Ministry said
the Minister, Alain Richard, would explain the
Government's view on the proposed merger at a
Western European Union (WEU) symposium on
defence industries to be held in Rome today.
Defence sources said the joint announcement by
the six companies seemed to back Richard's
oft-stated view that, despite international press
reports to the contrary, British and German
aerospace giants would not forge an alliance
without France.
France has moved to consolidate its large
domestic industry, announcing a merger of
Aerospatiale with Matra High Technology, the
aeronautics business of the Lagardere group,
which has links with other European defence firms,
including a missiles venture with British Aerospace.

The domestic consolidation, expected to be
completed next year, will fold in combat plane
manufacturer Dassault Aviation, clearing the way
for the establishment of a pan-European group, the
French Government said last week. – Reuters

US backs oil firms’ Saudi investment

THE US Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson,
yesterday supported an expansion of US energy
investment in Saudi Arabia, the biggest prize in
world energy with the largest oil production, exports
and reserves.
Announcing a visit to the kingdom in January to
encourage US investment contacts, Richardson
suggested – despite Saudi signals to the contrary –
that this might involve the country's prized upstream
exploration and production sector.
Richardson said in London he understood some
form of involvement in Saudi Arabia's upstream
was on the cards, a development that would raise
the prospect of US access to Saudi's reserves of
260 billion barrels of crude.
"My understanding is that Saudi leaders want to
see upstream investment and joint projects. They
haven't been specific entirely yet. I think there are
discussions going on with the companies," he said.

"The US Government views this as a healthy
development. We will encourage it and that will be
one of the main purposes of my trip, to encourage
this joint upstream investment in both Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait."
Saudi Arabia's neighbor Kuwait is openly seeking
Western help in developing its large oil reserves
through operating service agreements that would
give western partners a share in the proceeds of
new oil produced with their help.
Richardson, who spoke to reporters on the
sidelines of the annual Oil and Money conference in
London, said he had discussed Kuwait's plans in a
meeting in the United States last week with Kuwaiti
Oil Minister, Shaikh Saud Nasser Al Sabah. "Saudi
Arabia's interest in opening its upstream market
has been widely repoted – hailed by industry as a
potential major breakthrough," Richardson said.
Prince Abdullah has not held a similar meeting with
European companies but Saudi insiders have said
neither they nor Asian oil companies are
necessarily excluded from submitting ideas.
Oil majors seeking big Gulf upstream roles could
lose some of the skills and assets necessary for the
job if a price-led wave of downsizing and
consolidation continues, the conference said.
Pressure from investors for better returns and
cost-cutting could result in "anorexic" oil companies
lacking the depth of skills or access to capital to
provide attractive partners for oil-dependent Gulf
states, oil executives and bankers said.
"The opportunities are likely to be more numerous
than the ability of the industry to pay for them at
current cash flows," Pierre Jungels, Chief Executive
of British independent Enterprise Oil, told the Oil
and Money conference.
"The industry will also find it can't get the people
with the ability to do these projects if the current
bout of downsizing continues," he said. – Reuters

Toru Kusukawa, said Asian countries should peg their currencies not primarily against the dollar

Euro Could Dethrone the Dollar in
Asia


By Philip Segal International Herald Tribune

HONG KONG - Although the economies of Asia remain
shell-shocked, Asian countries still hold hundreds of billions of
dollars in cash and could play a key role in determining the
success of next year's major economic event: the creation of
Europe's single currency, the euro, Jan. 1.

Europe's money also promises to play a much greater role in
Asian finance.

While Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand have had to resort
to International Monetary Fund bailouts, Asia remains the
world's dominant lender, with well over $500 billion in
foreign-currency reserves, most of them in U.S. dollars.

Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other economies in
Southeast Asia are financing America's continuous and growing
current-account deficits.

That means Asia buys a lot of American bonds, but that could
change. Asia holds a combined 40.5 percent of the world's
foreign-currency reserves, and it is the possible movement of
some of those reserves from dollars to euros next year that
could have the biggest individual effect on how strong the euro
turns out to be, analysts said. "The decision by Asian central
banks is crucial - it's key," said Lorenzo Codogno, economist at
the Bank of America in London.

The United States has a 21 percent share of the world's
economy. But the U.S. dollar made up 56.4 percent of
international reserves at the end of last year, according to the
IMF. Reserves in European currencies - including four that will
not convert to the euro on Jan. 1 - made up just 26 percent, even
though Europe's contribution to the world economy is about
equal to America's.

Should some of these imbalances get redressed after January,
there is plenty at stake.

If the euro gains in value against the dollar, central banks would
prove to be big buyers of bonds denominated in euros, analysts
said. That could put serious pressure on the value of the dollar,
because there would be lower demand for U.S. Treasury bonds
and therefore less demand for buying dollars.

The dollar could then fall, bringing renewed inflationary pressure,
which itself could reduce the likelihood of further cuts in U.S.
interest rates next year. Of course, there would also be benefits
to a cheaper dollar, which would tend to make American
products more competitive on foreign markets and thus be likely
to increase exports.

While they see it as a possibility, though, many analysts say they
do not expect an overnight movement into euros in the weeks
after the debut of the euro Jan. 1, when individuals and
businesses will be able to start using the euro for check,
credit-card and financial transactions. The introduction of the
physical currency will come two years later.

"Central banks in Asia tend to be much more conservative" than
their counterparts in Europe, said Ma Guonan, an economist at
Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. As a result, he said, they
might decide to wait a few months to see how the euro fares
before undertaking major shifts in their reserve currencies.

On Nov. 1, Leon Brittan, vice president of the EU Commission
and one of a series of EU officials recently in China to help talk
up the euro, said Beijing would convert a "serious amount" of its
$141 billion in foreign-exchange reserves in 1999 from dollars
to euros.

It is clear that in 1999 and beyond, Europe's money will play a
greater role in Asian finance, as the European bloc begins
trading in a currency that will be far more liquid than the
individual European currencies are today. Governments in Asia,
which today might not look closely at lending in Irish punts or
Spanish pesetas, may well decide to buy Irish or Spanish bonds
denominated in the same euros used by France and Germany.

As for companies and governments in Asia looking to issue
new debt, "everybody's going to be looking to fund in the euro,"
said the head of origination at a European bank in Tokyo.

"The Japanese want to issue into the euro," he said. "People
want to make use of this new megamarket."

The euro may start slowly, he said, but a few large issues from
supranational agencies such as the World Bank could give a
major lift to confidence in the currency.

In fact, it is the bond market that could lead the way for a shift of
central bank reserves. The changeover may not come so much
in the shift of cash but rather in purchases of euro-denominated
bonds with the proceeds of maturing dollar bonds, as well as
with cash that is continuing to roll into central banks of Asian
countries that are running current-account surpluses.

The United States is not the only country at risk in the event of a
strong euro, however. Should the euro really take off, there is a
danger that the much larger, more liquid capital market that
results could suck investment into Europe at the expense of
Asia, according to David Carse, deputy chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

"There must also be at least a possibility that closer integration
of the EU could make it more self-contained and
inward-looking," Mr. Carse said in a speech in Hong Kong last
week. "Intra-EU trade could increase, while that with the rest of
the world and Hong Kong could diminish."

In the first four months of this year, he said, Japan sold a net
$2.1 billion in stocks and bonds in Asia but bought $9.9 billion in
European securities. If this trend continues, he said, "extended
diversion of capital to Europe would undermine Asia's growth
prospects as well as Hong Kong's position as an international
financial center."

Japan has also been aware of the problems linked to a strong
euro. On Sunday, the chairman of the Fuji Research Institute,
Toru Kusukawa, said Asian countries should peg their
currencies not primarily against the dollar, as has been the case
for years, but to a three-tier basket of currencies made up of the
dollar, the euro and the yen, according to Agence
France-Presse.

Japan may also be waking up to the fact that a move away from
dollar funding in the bond markets would give it an opportunity to
increase the disproportionately tiny amount of yen-denominated
debt in the world's reserves.

A government task force that advises the Japanese finance
minister said recently that the government should consider
eliminating a series of withholding taxes on Japanese
government paper.

E100
FOA NOTE: What most analysts fail to grasp is that gold may well sell for
100 Euros per ounce by 2002! Of course, the exchange rate between the Euro
and the dollar may show gold trading at $1,000US or much, much higher! In
this event, "content of chocolate" as seen below, will be the least of anyone's
problems?



EURO COINS: Speculation supports gold

Gold fell marginally in London yesterday but found support at $293.50 an
ounce as news there might be gold Euro coins provided some support.
Andy Smith, analyst at Mitsui Bussan Commodities, said: On undemanding
assumptions, the bullion embodied in a gold E100 would exceed that in all
commemorative Japanese coins [700 tonnes], the entire issue of krugerrands
[more than 1,400 tonnes] and even that in all the Napoleons [French gold
coins] issued between 1865 and the first world war [13,000 tonnes].
He pointed out, however, that the proposal had previously been considered,
and rejected, by the European parliament. For the past 25 years European
politicians have been haggling over an acceptable compromise for the content
of chocolate. If the definition of a single European bar proves so sticky, what
chance quick progress on a gold Euro coin?

Pete (11/17/98; 16:29:31MDT - Msg ID:1012)

Mr. Pete,

World based currencies that are not tied to gold do come and go. It is a
natural part of the economic social order. This is expected and planned for.
As gold has been money for the extent of civilization, paper money may be
used as "world based" as long as it uses gold for backing.
When dollar went off official gold standard, it was hoped to return to gold at
later stage. This period of hope lasted some 15 years until 1985! The events
have progressed toward a new currency from that time. The European
Economic Unit (ECU) was created in early 80s and became the accepted
format for beginning a new day. Today, we approach this change!
It is the "practical understanding" that our modern world must use a "digital
paper money" for commerce. All accept this. However, without a "gold
currency" priced daily in the "free market", and used as real reserves for
backing, any "world currency reserve" would expand using "debt only" as the
tool. This result brings the eventual reckoning for all users. The "host
country" finds all other nations supporting it's "lifestyle", even as those
country's private financial infrastructure is destroyed. It is the rising US
equity markets and falling inflation that so indicates the last days of the
dollar! Many say this is a sign of strength for America, yet they know not
what time of life the dollar has attained. The "old man" has he become even
as persons place their financial horse upon his shoulders. The world debt
structure of this "old man" is such that the true pricing of gold in a new
currency, will bring such a weight as it will end his life!
The purpose of the evolution in "paper gold trade" is offered in many
reasons. At first, it was the "deception" to hide the "life age" of the dollar.
Much as your Hollywood actors obtain the "facelift", yes? This
"deception"(low gold price in US$), to surprise of many, was created by the
"Euro makers" not the "dollar makers". To their advantage, world traders and
dollar investors were greatly fooled and, as you say, "jumped on band
wagon" to help sell paper gold down! This action did prolong life of dollar as
was needed, for the Euro was taking much time to complete.
The intent of "large long paper positions" was to create future leverage
against "dollar gold price". The cost of positions is of little concern, as any
present or historical dollar gold price will be "of little meaning"! These
positions will not be "physically covered" in any great way as this will never
be needed. The final conclusion of this action will lock the Euro into a gold
price, always moving less higher than dollar. The world gold swap market
will complete the rest (LBMA volume)! In time, the favor of oil settled in
Euros will force unwinding of dollar/gold (dollars used to buy gold in open
market). Gold will be purchased, delivering metal for Euros to settle old
leased contracts.
It has always been the desire for the "hard currency" to settle old dollar
debts. Dollar debts made "unreasonable" by the loss of "honest commerce"
by "dishonest exchange rates". As has been from the past, and will be in the
future, Gold does always settle the score! Thank You

Aragorn III ,
The E100 is just part of "the master plan", as Another calls it. Think about
it? For the present, political posturing will not allow the issuing of a true
circulating gold coin. Besides, why get to specific about it's use now when it
won't be needed until 2002. At that time the entire gold, Euro and dollar
markets will be viewed in a far different light. Perhaps the E100 will be used
to settle outstanding or defaulted gold loans? I never thought about it until
now, but Another never said the CB gold IOUs would be settled for paper
Euros, just Euros?? If the E100 is created as legal tender with no limits on
production ( not unlike the American Gold Eagle) and the exchange rates
bring the gold content value to within a then existing 100 paper Euro rate, the
Gold Euro would become the defacto world standard for money?? If you
really want to get your currency circulating, just allow the gold price as
denominated in all other nonEuro currencies (dollars included), explode in
price. The paper Euro (100 of them) and the E100 would come into parity!
Think about it for a while? I'll be back later to discuss this more. Thanks

One more thing. When I look back in past posts, Another often mentioned

eventually trade at the $6,000US value "IN PRESENT DOLLAR TERMS"!!
It now makes sense. In 2002, 100 Euros could represent a dollar exchange
rate of $6,000 gold. Perhaps 60US to 1Euro! $30,000+ gold was mentioned
if the entire currency system blew up prior to Euro launch! Looks like we will
get past that possible problem. Consider it! FOA

Aragorn III (11/17/98; 16:57:17MDT - Msg ID:1013)

Mr. Aragorn,
I have read your thinking as it was posted. A good consideration, indeed!
May I add this:

Thoughts of personal wealth are but the "little thing" for "nation states". It
is rightly so, for they must deal with the world in a "worldly manor". This
"dealing", it does require the shifting from one side to the other for
obtainment of end result. In all of human existence, politics has existed and it
does function today as "new money" is negotiated. The "good understanding"
at the BIS holds that "no new world class currency was ever brought forth
without attachment to gold". Our history books show this to be true, yes?
The modern politics of Western money has leveraged the world assets with
debt that offers little recourse if commerce slows. These debts, held as
reserves, become as paper in a world of slow business. My friend, your
private savings should not be at "the risk" with need of "the government
guarantee" if a recession or depression arrives. This be not the way to run a
"world reserve currency". Many modern leaders know this, but the politics
prevent the rapid change. However, slowly, the change does come. Often it is
offered in the way that allows forward progress, with options to "reconsider
rational" at later date.
As such we find ourselves today. The Euro was considered some time ago
as a new "western like" currency, with little gold. It did not receive the
backing of "oil settlement in Euros". From the early 1970s, oil became the
backing for the dollar in place of gold(see my other posts, also those of my good friend). That
mistake would not happen again.
It is, indeed well understood that introduction of a new gold related currency
into the Western "no gold" world would destroy many assets and greatly
slow business. Therefore, one "escape route" was created for "nation states"
and another for the private citizen.
When the commerce does slow, most metals will lose the demand of
business. This will be true for gold, also. However, physical gold will receive
the currency demand, a demand such as never seen before. It is in this
demand that the "escape route" for private assets be found. Plan journey well,
sir, we will not travel this path again in our time. Thank You

Euro nine plan unified stock market


The heads of nine European stock markets will
meet in Paris next week to create a Europe-wide
bourse after the launch of the euro single currency
in January, the Paris market authorities said
yesterday.
The announcement came after Madrid, Milan and
Brussels had said they would be interested in
joining a pan-European stock market proposed by
London and Frankfurt in July.
The SBF has invited the presidents of the
Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Madrid,
Milan, Stockholm and Zurich bourses to Paris on
27 November to discuss setting up a "federal-type
and competitive pan-European stock market," the
statement said.
Paris, which had initially hoped to set up its own
Europe-wide stock market system, appeared finally
to bow to the inevitable and accept that if London
and Frankfurt were already linked there was little
chance of attracting partners to a rival system.
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said yesterday that it was perfectly "logical" for
Paris to join the alliance.
He said the idea was to set up a joint company to
run a single stock market from January.
"The stock exchanges in Frankfurt and London are
very happy with the decision by Paris," said
Deutsche Boerse spokesman Norbert Essing.
"We've wanted a pan-European solution from the
very beginning and it is in the interests of both the
clients and the markets."
After the launch of the euro, stocks on many
European markets will be quoted in euros, and the
Anglo-German plan was to set up a single market,
enabling members to deal in leading stocks on
either market. This will be made much easier by the
fact that there will be no currency conversion
problems, and allowing dealers to trade easily in
shares in several countries should also boost trade,
analysts say.
When Frankfurt and London announced their tie-up
in July, they invited other leading European stock
markets, including the market in Paris, to join but
had received no positive responses until Madrid
agreed to join on Wednesday.
The L’Agefi newspaper said yesterday that the
Paris stock exchange had signed a letter of intent
to join a three-way market allowing for
cross-membership of all three markets, and trading
in stocks on all three markets, from January 4.
Madrid agreed to join the alliance on Wednesday,
and the head of the Milan exchange, Stefano
Preda, said yesterday that he hoped "an
agreement will be reached rapidly" on such a
market, although he said he thought the tie-up
would involve only six countries.
Brussels stock market President Olivier Lefebvre
meanwhile told Europe 1 radio that he was "very
interested" in such a tie-up.
"We immediately expressed an interest" after
London and Frankfurt announced they had agreed
on an alliance in July, "because stock markets
cannot remain isolated in a European context," he
added.
The nine markets involved had a total capitalisation
of $5.58 trillion at the end of 1997, or half the value
of the US stock markets, according to figures from
the international stock market federation.
The New York stock exchange alone had a total
capitalisation of $8.88 trillion at the end of 1997. –

Central Bankers Rebuff Lafontaine

Led by Greenspan, They Reject Exchange-Rate
Trading Bands


By John Schmid International Herald Tribune

FRANKFURT - Some of the world's most powerful central
bankers rejected calls for currency exchange target rates Friday
and warned European governments that political pressure on
the new European Central Bank could damage trust in the
single currency.

The notion that exchange-rate trading bands should be imposed
to curb the sort of destructive flows of speculative "hot money"
that triggered the Asian economic crisis is an "illusion," said
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board,
at a central bankers' meeting in Frankfurt.

A volley of unvarnished comments by typically cautious central
bankers suggested that the proposal, which has been a
cornerstone of economic policy by the new German finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, can now be called dead, said Adolf
Rosenstock, international economist for Nomura International
PLC.

"That is a first-class confirmation that this initiative is coming to
an end," he said.

In recent days, Mr. Lafontaine has begun to back away from his
initiative, which his administration initially vowed to put on the
international agenda when Germany assumes the rotating
chairmanship of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations
next year.

For Mr. Lafontaine, the bankers' convention amounted to
another setback in his hopes to assert his authority over policy
in Bonn's new Social Democratic government. This week, Mr.
Lafontaine's undersecretary at the Finance Ministry, Heiner
Flassbeck, was denied the powerful post of representing
Germany at international economic summit meetings - a role
that traditionally would go to him.

Political pressure for looser lending rates after the German
elections in September gave the European Central Bank, which
will manage monetary policy for the 11 nations adopting the
euro Jan. 1, the first test of its autonomy.

Central bankers have consistently asserted the need for the new
bank to be independent, a message they reiterated Friday in
Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank.

Mr. Greenspan called Mr. Lafontaine's call for regulation of
exchange rates flawed, saying it "is just not feasible or
credible."

Markets would view foreign-exchange bands "with great
skepticism, with good reason," he said.

Mr. Greenspan's criticism of Mr. Lafontaine was poignant, for
the German has taken pains to laud Mr. Greenspan for his
recent reductions of U.S. lending rates.

Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,
agreed with Mr. Greenspan, saying that exchange rate target
zones were "not sustainable." Mr. Duisenberg pledged that the
European Central Bank would consider exchange-rate targets
"only in exceptional circumstances," if the euro showed a "clear
and persistent misalignment."

Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, also said it would
be impossible to fix exchange rates. Trading bands that are too
wide are "meaningless" and tighter bands are "impossible," Mr.
George said.

Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, warned that calls
for lower interest rates - which he likened to a "political siege"
on the new central bank's autonomy - threatened to undermine
the single currency.

"The international role of the euro and global interdependence
increase the damage that such conflicts can potentially cause,"
Mr. Tietmeyer said.

The euro, which is sure to gain "international importance,"
cannot afford to be weak, Mr. Tietmeyer continued. "It cannot be
in the interests of either the United States or of Europe for each
other's currency to be weak."

The success of the euro will depend on how credibly the
European Central Bank plays its role, Mr. Tietmeyer said.

"Damage in situations of conflict is limited as long as the
markets remain convinced that the European Central Bank and
its decision makers are independent," he said.

That the euro will become a major international force after its
introduction was not questioned Friday.

"It would be completely inconceivable, not to say disastrous, if
the euro were unable to gain international importance," Mr.
Tietmeyer said.

"Only 10% of gold trade is conducted on officialexchanges such as Comex or Nymex"
23 November 1998
New focus on gold
traders

Producers band together in bid to increase
transparency in derivatives and futures
markets

David McKay


THE world's leading gold producers, including
Anglogold and North American rival Barrick Gold,
have banded together in an attempt to increase
transparency in the speculative gold trading
market which has been blamed for the drastic
decline in the metal's price since 1996.

Bobby Godsell, the CE of the world's largest gold
producer, Anglogold, said yesterday producers of
more than half of the world's gold output, about
36-million ounces a year, were represented at a
brainstorming session in London on Saturday.
The intention was to "turn the spotlight on" gold
trading, particularly in the derivatives and futures
markets.

This is the first time major gold producers have
assembled to discuss strategies on commonly
held market concerns. The meeting comes
against the background of a poor gold price,
which fell performance which has seen bullion
slide from more than $400/oz in early 1996 to
about $260 earlier this year. It is now about $295.

A report back on progress made at the meeting is
planned for February or March. The proposals will
also be taken to the World Gold Council whose
responsibilities the producers hope to broaden
rather than replace.

"The aim of the meeting was to broaden and
deepen the pattern of co-operation between the
world's gold producers and initiate dialogue with
market makers. We want to find out who the
market players are," Godsell said. The producers
hoped to introduce smaller and medium-sized
companies to continual dialogue.

Harmony MD Bernard Swanepoel, whose
company is not a member of the World Gold
Council, said he backed the initiative. It would be
useful if it could help producers to understand the
gold market.

Only 10% of gold trade is conducted on official
exchanges such as Comex or Nymex. The
remaining 90% is conducted over the counter.
There is a body called the Commitment of
Traders which attempts to monitor these
transactions, but market traders are not bound to
report to it and its findings are not regarded as
being representative.

BOE Securities Gerard Kemp said traders
closely guarded their positions on gold, but the
producers believed they could change the
sentiment about gold. He believed this might be
difficult to do.

One of the major depressants of the gold price
recently has been sales by central banks of
portions of their gold reserves, contributing to the
common perception that the metal is no longer a
store of wealth. However, Godsell said "the fear of
disruption" caused by central bank sales
appeared to have gone away.

REALITY?
Good day to all! I offer this as a means to consider the world, in perhaps a way not seen before. It makes use of private discussions with Another, taken place during my absence from world affairs. His words are clearly separate from mine. Will anyone recognize from where the title
came? Please do interpret these words as indeed, I do also interpret yours!


"ON THE FRINGE OF REALITY"

We travel through this world with our own notions of value and worth. Often giving little thought as to what part external forces play to impact our final conclusions upon these ideals. Nor do we fully understand the concepts that shape these same ideals in the minds of others.

"Another: My friend, "this game of chess" you play it well, yes? As do I. Truly, we understand the "rules of contact" concerning gold. If one player does touch his "most valuable piece", he must move it! But, in what direction will the "king of gold" or the "queen of Euros" be moved?
Each positioning, it does create different perception of "value" for opponent."

Truly, in this light we can see that our concepts of value and worth are clearly governed through the positioning of assets by political players. They move a strategic asset to the right and all other things on the board are reevaluated. To the left, a different worth is considered. Consider now, that all pieces, in this chess game of worth, hold a changing value in the minds of people in all world economies. Oil, copper, steel, currencies, they are, everyday, priced as to their usefulness not only to the owners, but also in the strategic value they hold in the eyes of our opponents. Those with whom we wish to trade! Only the King is held as the final player. When an opposing political entity posses your king in checkmate, we lose the strategic advantage to play the game. A king of gold gives the government the ability to declare this money game void
and start completely over. A move not taken lightly by the opponents.

Now consider the currencies ONLY, their daily changing worth, the value they hold in daily world trade and their value to us in our business of living life? A clear thinking person must agree with the conclusion that this is only a game. Do these paper security contracts really hold any
value for your life, except in their acceptance by others in trade? If our government moved an important chess player only one space, our native currency could lose all value to others! In such an event would this item still hold value for you?
Because the trading of paper securities (stocks, bonds, currencies, etc.) have become the only avenue for world economic activity, we are all compelled to play this game of chess. Like it or not, your very net worth is every day, in play! And, as such, we all watch for the next move on the board. Each, in his own quiet way, ready to act quickly and purchase the "next paper asset" that appears to hold value in trade. That is, before our neighbor beats us to it. Think now, is this the way of the free market and the democratic order that one was brought up to expect? Your life savings, not at risk of being lost, just at risk of being reevaluated to a lower level of importance in commerce.

But people, what if? What if this game of Dollar chess was quietly, out of sight, being lost? How will you know to move before others do if you cannot see the entire board? Confidence is a strange human emotion. It is fragile beyond compare. Many confuse "confidence in ones holdings" with "confidence in our judgment of others confidence"! There is a big difference. In other words, we depend on the judgment of others to protect the maintain the value of our assets. In seeking real security, our position of wealth is safe and fair as long as we can grasp how others are valuing our holdings! Openly, in the interaction of daily markets that we see "how others value what we have", thereby instilling our own confidence. But, In doing such, we take for granted one major premise, "we can see the entire playing field and all of it's players in the same light as others see it"! It is here that we approach a truth that, paper wealth today does occupy "the very edge of reality"!

"Another: It is asked that a dollar be strong in gold? It is done. These many years gold price is lowered. Brokers stand tall and say "we bring gold down" and "our judgment be correct". They hold the mind of "young boys" in early years, yes? Know them not their work was a biding for the central banks. They will come to know "good judgment" in short time. It is asked for another knight in the game? It is done better. A powerful queen comes for our use, this new Euro. Now they ask this Euro be strong in Oil. It will be done! Need dollar continue be held strong in gold? "my friend, old trees die long deaths, but die they will if water comes not" " this rain of oil will no
longer find your Washington Oak"

Today, we have come to the "edge of reality" in believing that our paper contracts (cash included) are actually more valuable than the the THINGS we buy with them! For most individuals and national governments, our net worth is denominated in contracts of Delivery. The cash in your pocket is a receipt for the delivery of one dollar. Your stocks are contracts for a share of the profits in a company. Bonds, cash in the bank (CDs included) are contracts for delivery of future cash. The only value found in all of these securities comes from selling them to
someone else. A game that is played using the value judgment of another. Take your time and think slowly through this. The laws of supply and demand are muted by the accepted concept that "paper securities can all be converted into real things at the present price of real things". In the
end, this is the value judgment that everyone basis their holdings of paper wealth on. The Thought that, "someone else wants my paper assets because THEY can convert them into the things THEY need at today's prices". How easily would this fragile confidence be shattered if suddenly the payment for these Things required "Things in payment"? Would this not create a realignment of the value judgment of paper, worldwide?

Consider oil? Supply and demand rules the price, you say? I say, that is your value judgment based on the supply and demand of oil as seen in dollar payment. Now, see the settlement of oil trades denominated in Euros only and require a payment of things to augment dollar settlements.
Suddenly, the price of oil changes radically even as the supply and demand stays the same! Because of this and at the same time, worldwide, the judgment of the value of Things as
expressed in paper contracts will changes! In this light we find that the excess capacity of our life's work, as stored in the value of paper assets is no longer worth the Real Things it could be traded for.

Here, one confronts the Reality that during our long life, we did not create as much excess worth from our endeavors as we thought. Truly, all these years the Western economies produced no more assets than many Third World Countries! I ask you, for the future, in what world class
money will you hold the savings of a lifetime? And more importantly, will others judge it to have value? Will you continue to "trade gold to make more paper currency" or "will you trade paper assets to acquire more gold"? Most will agree, the choice will impact one's net worth for the rest of their life!

"Another: It is to say, "these westerners are not as rich as there currency say they are"!"

Some day you will read in the financial pages: "It is in the value judgment of paper assets that
people found the lies."

"Gold, yesterday, today and tomorrow"

jinx44
jinx44,
Hello! Thank you also for your consideration. Your question: What keeps the euro so strong?

The Euro has not been strong, yet. The greatest hurdle for this new currency was just crossed, it was born! Every known Western power in the dollar economic world hurled against this new competitor for the reserve currency spot. Indeed, it is alive today and will impact the future
economic landscape for the next fifty years, at least.
jinx44, we have to understand that in today's modern world, currencies are not strong on their own. They are made week or made strong through usage. All of the same questions you asked about the Euro could also be asked of the dollar? I state them again in a dollar context: no statement or rule that ties the United States gold reserves to any mechanism of convertibility except the current manipulated commercial markets. ---- it is only the good intentions of
America's largest socialist states that back the dollar. --- The fact that the US possess 0% (how will we know???) of reserves in dedicated gold is not necessarily proof that they will give me any of that upon demand. --- California and Michigan have moved further left. Democratic socialism
and its' dollar isn't a dream date for my precious daughter gold --- !!! You see, all of these apply, yet the dollar has been very strong these many years.
For a modern currency to be strong, it must be used extensively to denominate trade. Truly, that is the only value of a digital currency. But why promote a digital currency such as the dollar or the Euro? The answer lies with the modern world, it's the only way we can trade globally in an efficient manner. Then we further ask, why promote the Euro over the dollar. Ironically, the very
prospect of free world trade, so fought for by the American Administration, is the condition that the IMF/dollar system cannot handle! The debt built up from all of the past, unfree, projectionist old world trade is killing the transition. The policy is to sell free trade and the narrow margins it produces as they shut down entire economies because the low profits cannot service the old debt. Do you follow the logic and the problem? This brilliant, modern free trade system and all of it's benefits cannot be implemented using the US dollar as a reserve currency. It shuts off commerce that in turn limits the use of commodities such as oil, metals, food and the like. Many hail the low price inflation in the US as a victory and ignore the intent other nations had in following "free
trade". That being to promote a world economy, not just a US economy.
Enter the Euro! Understand that the increased use of commodities is a good thing. It's not just for the purpose of making rising chart pattern so speculators can sell their calls! Commodity usage creates real things and helps the lives of real people. When citizens gain real productive
mechanisms, they hold real wealth. Some would have you believe that third world people are enriched by saving US treasury bonds, not true! The only way to increase world trade, with an eye on building new consumers in all countries, is to remove the overhang of "dollar settlement".
The US started the free trade movement but quickly backed away when it was realized that the US currency, backed by debt through the fractional reserve system, would suffer sever inflation in the transition. Government guarantees would require the treasury (and Fed) to print unbelievable
amounts of new currency to cover the unserviceable debt that Free Trade would create! Now, Europe is going to finish the job using a new currency to supplant "dollar settlement". The ECB has agreed to allow their gold to be "marked to the market" quarterly. IN doing so, oil will slowly be transitioned to settle in Euros as the dollar is lowered in value against gold. The benefit to oil will be the increased world demand that a Euro settlement Free Trade will create. Once this train begins, everyone will jump on it. Why? Because it will benefit the largest part of the world
population. The dollar will implode and gold will soar in dollar terms.

So you see, my friend, the world is changing! The evolving gold market isn't about shorts being squeezed, or manipulation by banks or lawsuits. It's much, much bigger than that! As Another so often puts it "we watch this new gold market together, Yes?" Yes! FOA

It should be obvious to all that I am not a trader. I do not think Another is either. Most of the observations given are offered to instill a path to follow for research, not to direct. Most gamblers (traders) try to find private information and act on it before it is common knowledge. Greed is the main motivation, certainly not the expansion of ones knowledge or protection of wealth. We often see people blindly follow the words of others without creating their own logical conclusions. No one will ever successfully manage their family wealth in this manner. Indeed, many have used the leverage of paper precious metals (including the white metals) to create great losses of wealth. Yet, Another has always striven to put the average citizen into physical gold as a percentage of their net worth. If you follow in the footsteps of giants, you gain proportionately as do these conservative people. My agenda is found in offering others an agenda that will hold true in a changing world.
Follow the news, think for yourself, observe the outcome of events in a different light. I think you will find this an interesting story as it unfolds. Yes, it is slow, but it holds true! The game of chess has many outcomes, but the objective is always to complete the journey with all of your

GOLD: YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW!
Hello!

In a very broad view, the governments have never stopped trading gold. For many years it has been treated just like any other world currency. Why? Because it is one! Yes, just like the Yen, Dollar, Mark, etc., Gold the currency is manipulated for it's Ability to affect the "value Judgment"
people place on all paper currencies. Jump back to: FOA (3/14/99; 11:17:14MDT - Msg ID:3351), with this line of thinking we can see that digital currencies are truly a State of Mind!
And, among Central Bankers, (BIS in particular) gold is the key in this world game of money chess. Forget all the visual physical sales and leasing of gold as a negative for the market. This metal is brought and sold no different than the foreign currencies the CBs hold. Investors keep
complaining about the "War on Gold" and the "Manipulation of Gold", yet these very actions Prove that gold has an important currency/reserve function!
So why are investors so unhappy and applying lawsuits? Because they are on the wrong Long side of the Gold market. The ones that have lost the most have applied the wrong value judgment to gold. They have invested in Gold the Commodity not Gold the currency! If there has been any
manipulation of the public mind set, it was here. Somewhere, in the last twenty years, people were sold on the idea that, unlike paper money that cannot be mined from the ground, gold can and everyone should play it like a commodity! Buy shares, futures, options and the like. Yet, all the
while pushing the money value of gold as the reason to justify it as a commodity trade! However, somewhere in the sales pitch, no one mentioned that this world currency had an important part to play in stabilizing dying paper currencies like the dollar!
You see, contrary to what some Western investors think, a large contingent of world reserve currency holders wanted to see the dollar made strong in gold. These people reap the real benefits of buying More Gold with less dollars! They even secure long term commitments (using proven reserves not current cash flow) to take delivery of far future physical gold while the price is low in dollar terms. It is in no small way that this function has improved, not only the demand for dollar based trade settlement worldwide, but the concept that it has gold value. Sure the process is
unsustainable if everyone tries to convert, but most trading of digital currencies is for commerce, not conversion. The process of enhancing the value of the dollar in Gold is a short term fix in a much larger scope of change!
I find it curious that some world investors are on the correct long side of gold investing while so many others are on the wrong side and losing money?? Perhaps it is after all, our concept of money is just the value judgment of others. One day oil is 10 a barrel $US and gold is 300 $US,
the next day oil is 50 and gold is 3000! Yet the only thing that has changed is the Value Of Gold As A Currency and the Dollar State Of Mind.

I will build on this throughout the day and discuss with anyone interested. Turbohawg, let's talk about this oil supply and demand? I sent your post to Another. I think he will write something for you around 6:00PM Atlantic Time (I think) FOA

REPLY TO PHinLA
PHinLA:
Hello! If we look back at my "FOA (3/14/99; 16:17:55MDT - Msg ID:3362)" a broad outline begins to take shape with respect to the Euro. But, when searching for the end result of this world money chess game we have to apply all of the players in the contest. Let me expand:
If we can agree that oil is the most important world commodity then we can conclude that the "reserves of inground oil" constitute the real foundation for all future commerce. The owners of these reserves are very aware that any mispricing of oil (in real terms) can and does lead to
disruptions in the world trade. However, mispricing is not just a function of "the price" of oil but also how oil is priced, as in; What medium of exchange is it denominated? It was understood some time ago that the $US would indeed become "debted out" as digital currencies go. It was the logical conclusion to the world reserve money being removed from the gold exchange standard. If you have read Another, then you understand that the dollar was moved off gold, in 71 as a US strategic play to force the Middle eastern oil up in dollar price. This would allow the marginal reserves occupying friendly US nations to produce without competing against the "low cost" reserves that were soon to dominate world production. Thus giving the Western economic
structure breathing room to continue functioning on an IMF/dollar based settlement system, even while off the gold standard. We arrive at the final result today, with the dollar so expanded that it is failing the "free trade conversion" the world so craves. Entire countries are economically impaired in an effort to maintain the fictional valuations of "US assets"! (again please read FOA #3362)
The strategy to counter this outcome started with the formation of the ECU (European Economic Unit). It was started in the early eighties as a precursor to the now existing EURO. As Another said before, it took at least ten years longer than anyone thought, but it's here. In no small
way has this been responsible for the 18 year (gold bear market, as some would call it) upward revaluation of the dollar by the BIS. It was the longest "stop gap measure" I have ever known to exist! A tremendous success by any standard, to keep the dollar stable for such a time. Many
think it was "good old American know how" that did it. Well, now we will see "who knows how" as the world unwinds all of this dollar debt!
The Euro, in and of itself will never be a true reflection of the social and economic functions in the Pan European Arena. Much the same way as the global use and valuation of the dollar was truly never a reflection of the Real America! A true world reserve digital currency is maintained by usage in trade settlement and Gold Currency Valuations. As it is, this is created through BIS
manipulations of foreign exchange (dirty float) and "official money flows out of all non reserve currencies into gold (CB deals)". You have but to look at most native currency gold price charts to see how the dollar is benefited. The converse of this will show the Euro as the future stable gold pricing mechanism. However, we have never, in modern world affairs, had a world reserve currency of the current dollar scope removed from a supported gold valuation. The chart of the dollar in gold will be incredible for the short time that it is allowed to express the obvious. Then the controls will begin!

To answer your question: "Why has the Euro been so weak? One might have expected that others (as in the markets) would already be deducing the "secret moves" and re-evaluating the value of the dollar accordingly."
PH, please allow that this is not a "New York day trade", but rather a world money transformation that will affect you "down to the shoes on your feet". The current change in the
nature of Arabia should be telling! I'll let Another describe, later. Also, history usually documents that the most earth moving events were obvious, all along, but no one believed them!
And, Yes, I do think that the oil markets are going for the Euro, at least in Pan European trade for now!

Phantom,
Hello! I enjoyed the commits in your post (#3616). Your statement, "This manipulation of keeping the gold price down is politically one of the most important events which we can observe on the financial markets." is so very true! I am taken by how many investors completely underestimate the time cycle that the dollar is entering. It is truly old when considered in unbacked paper currency history. Many of the games being played today, in financial markets, would not be
considered if the players really grasped the enormity of the problem.
Your analysis of the international banking community should conclude, that bankers have also played fast and loose in a changing currency exchange environment. Many of the thinkers that dominate the US Federal Reserve may indeed lose the very game they created.
You say; "extremely exciting times in which we are living"! Indeed! FOA

Hello! It is so very simple. Yet people stumble over the concept because most western investors don't value gold as a currency. They play it as a commodity and cannot grasp the importance of holding it as long term money. In reality, if you follow my earlier post that oil is the present value
foundation for this modern industrialized world, one must agree that it is the ultimate currency! In the context of real human things that we can touch and feel, oil is worth perhaps $200 a barrel.

USAGOLD--TEXAS OIL?
Texas Oil Patch,
Well, I have been in Houston and I can tell you that Oil Rumors are as numerous as rifles in the back of Pick-up-trucks! Weather they are doing in-fill drilling or opening up new proven reserves, the remake of Aramco underscores one point. The Arabian reserves are still the most important in the world! With Saudi overproduction at 8 mills/day, they were able to virtually shut down all new
potentials. The Caspian basin, as big as it is, was almost written off! The same applies to many other finds, so called "middle east killers". I might add that the offer to develop was also extended to European firms. I bet, that in the future the cost of drilling will be much cheaper in Euros than dollars? We shall see.
The middle eastern reserves, as currently priced in dollars, leaves them unable to service debt and even gives the appearance of going under! In reply I add; Why do we think the price of gold needed to be lowered in dollars, if not to appease this inoperable situation. The finances of this region are but in a transitory state. Reprice oil in Euros and watch the dollar collapse, then reexamine the balance sheet. The value of those massive reserves will overwhelm all debt!
As Euro oil settlement proceeds, watch for all producers, worldwide, to join OPEC! The US congress will no doubt have to pass laws (again) to prevent their native reserves from being sold at Euro rates. The chess game continues! thanks FOA

My thinking.
The Stranger,
I have an observation. I covered some of your items (#3623) in my post to Texas OIL. My question is, Who in their right mind would lend gold using high priced production reserves as collateral? Reserves such as Mexico, that can be made immobile with the turn of a desert valve?? Is this a super secret conspiracy? No, just the inner workings of free trade. All we have to do is open the books at the LBMA and see where all the gold commitments are assigned. They trade more gold than exists. Some entities are on the long side and they are not committed to it because it's a commodity used for watches and rings! Keep your eye on this as it unfolds, Mr. Stranger.
We will get back to reality!

Hello, both of you! "little guy", Your question is to Another, but it ties in with my reply to Goibniu, so here are both in one.
Gold mining is a business like any other. You mine it as cheap as possible for the express purpose of Selling It for Paper currency. The small miner does it to earn a living and the major miner does it for the shareholders. No one is in the business to mint legal coins, influence foreign
exchange rates or save the financial system. To the miner, gold is a commodity business not a currency business. The risks are obvious and the same as, say an oil company. That being that someone may unload, physical product or future product securities onto the market and drive the price below production. The problem with gold mining is that many, many publicly traded companies bandwagoned on the idea / trend of offering investors mining stock as a substitute for gold currency (physical bullion and coins). This has had the multiyear effect of driving the perceived value of everything from IPOs to seasoned companies, through the roof! That is, with respect to their value based on profits. (see my earlier post today).
The world currencies tumble in value because of manipulation, yet no one is filing lawsuits because of it. So When the gold currency falls against the dollar, every one that brought a gold stock on the perceived notion that it was a substitute for gold wants their money back? If it is manipulation that is unjust, what about all of the millions of people that are buying gold at a huge discount? Did not this "great manipulation" benefit them? So what if the scheme went the other way and gold rose tremendously, thereby forcing the dollar holders (big investor and small
investor alike) to pay a much higher price for physical, and the miners making great gains? Will the lawsuits still be filed? You see, the problem stems from leverage players making a commodity bet using the mines as a vehicle, while hoping the play piggybacks on the currency play in gold! It
didn't happen.
Truly, the sad fact is that most of the major miners are not gold bugs, they are mine bugs with only the intention of raising the PE ratio through a good story that will, in fact eventually leave them out of the game. The coming change in the world financial structure will value gold as such that any in ground reserves will be confiscated through taxes! We will not lose a world reserve currency system, without all the heart ache that implies and still allow the reserves of GOLD the MONEY to go untaxed. Unjust, perhaps. But no more so than closing the gold window in the early seventies.
In this modern day, we cannot go into the gold mining business and declare the dollar will fall because of a lack of GOLD backing, and then expect everyone to just eat their loses on US government issued debt! Be wary of the precedent you create, it may come back at you.

Mr. Turbohawg,
I read with interest, this thinking of oil demand! It is, as you say "the outcome of least desire"! Search the world, my friend and find me the result of present economic downturn? Is it not the dollar structure and debt it be built high upon? Oil demand is broken from dollar default, not less requirement of oil for manufacturing need. Future true valuation of all US dollar assets does show the equity lies low from present expressions of value. We see this froth in Dow Jones, yes? It is as the foam upon the ocean after the wind of much churning. Soon to become the calm sea of major loses for investors in this storm! The loss of this value, thru currency settlement change would indeed benefit world and harm only excess in America. Other nations would find much demand for products of local production, if priced in new currency that brings no default.
My friend, the drive to save oil demand does also save world commerce! This move to Euro, it is done for benefit of all and the one world we share! The devaluation of present reserve currency does bring loss of IMF environment and asset impairment for some, however, it finds freedom for
production expansion in the home of many, many more!
"the demand for oil is as the demand of humans for things, define this demand and you will number the need for oil"

I am at a disadvantage because Another is (I believe) off-line. I will reply to your #3648 and bid good day for several weeks. Upon return, I will make an effort to regularly check in and post on this forum.
The IMF gold sales are only talk. They would sell it in a second if it were theirs to sell. The real problem comes from the fact that the "laundry boys" (international gold dealers and brokers) over did the selling and leasing. For a long time they were doing the work of the CBs, then they just kept at it until completely underwater. It was Another, some long time ago that first said the gold short position was around 13,000 to 14,000 ton. This was when 3,000 was first being discussed. Now I read more estimates in the 13 to 14 range. Don't worry, it will never, ever be covered in
any way except cash settlement. Mostly in Euros? They will most likely receive loans, but it will financially destroy them. Last year, right after the Belgian announcement bringing to light the last of the CB leasing, it was expected that the loss of physical supply would create a rush to settle and drive the gold price back into the mid $300 in the first wave of defaults. It didn't happen! Even
with the birth of the Euro, and the possibility of cash Euro settlement, they didn't cover. It has become so large that the paper just keeps getting shuffled from one entity to another. We will know when it starts, as the Euro will spike first, then gold will begin it's climb.
All of this may have been slowed, waiting for the EU clean up. With the old guard out, the official money will begin to roll in. This year? I think this summer. Either way, it's going to be something to observe. thank you all for this discussion. FOA

OIL!
ALL:
I have been reading many of the fine articles written here over the last several weeks. This forum has grown and many thanks are given to Mr. Michael Kosares for providing it. Rather than commit on the older posts, today, I will just jump in here with what Christine has offered.

Christine, hello! I read the "Missing barrels, paper barrels, illusion of oil glut" article linked to your post. It was an excellent piece by Mr. Mathew Simmons. It certainly does offer hard evidence that many of the conclusions reached by public thinkers are incorrect. How many times have we heard that oil is just a commodity, subject to the same supply and demand pressures as
other items used in everyday life? I think much of the blame can be laid at the feet of high level financial analysis that control much of the mainstream media highlight. These well educated figures are often dominated by "technical analysis" analysis and consider that the price of anything at the close is the correct conclusion. As it is, if oil trades at $2.00 then that must represent all the factors that come to bear and therefore, crude oil is indeed worth only $2.00 a barrel. This is true enough, except that "political encouragement" is never accepted as a component in these "factors", rendering their analysis to be out of context. Therefore, in real life, one of the real forces that would create this fictional $2.00 value are considered something irrelevant or impossible in modern society! These "Missing barrels" and "paper barrels" are indeed part of the western economic equation. Why would a society that accepts digital paper currency as money find paper oil a problem? I think that anyone that reads this forum would agree that cheaper oil has given them a higher living standard today than they would have had if oil was $100. How would you
stand today if oil had continued upwards right after the Gulf War in the early 90s? Yet, the realities of Real supply and demand have not changed from the time of that event. Even thought Mr. Simmons article deals with the latest several year history, it can be used as an example of
how oil is politically priced. "Another" pointed out some time ago that the over production by Arabia (8 million+) did not occur because demand required it, rather it was "politically purchased". This was the bane of failure for many investors in the oil and gold mining industry. Their financial loss was truly used to purchase time! A purchase that benefited many more than it hurt. Today, we come to the end of this international currency chess game. Again, I make this conclusion from Another's Thoughts. In the spring of last year, the world economic system could purchase no more time. When the European Central Banks decided to cycle down the assignment of gold as an inducement for low priced oil in dollar terms, the world was going to change. In the
process of building a fort of refuge around Europe, the BIS has locked the Euro to gold by not allowing any more sales. Nor will they allow it to fall below $280US! When the dollar debt, worldwide, begins it's crash, all commodity settlement will rush to the Euro. What will make the dollar fall? A worldwide dollar inflation, induced by a soaring oil price, created by the non settlement of oil in dollars! Yes, just as Mr. Simmons showed you that the oil glut is not real, but a paper game, so will the price of gold show:
"you westerners are not as rich as your currency say
you are".

Christine and all, perhaps we can discuss this further? Then I would like to offer some thoughts such as " An Economy Biased On Paper Currency Inflation And Commodity Price Deflation Will Lead To Financial Disaster". Thanks

THOUGHTS!
ALL,
Today my friends, this game of money, it does move to the center of focus? Many do bet the fortunes of life that this outcome will pass as "a quiet night"! It will not.
For weeks, months, days and years we have spoken of changes that come. It is of the future we have thought and forward in the many miles we have seen. Together, this new gold market was observed, by us, indeed, as a people. A strange beast it be, for many the thinker looked
backwards to see forwards as was their custom. Devoured they were as this new market did arrive, without warning, from the future!
Other thinkers, they were short and make much profits as they did ride on the "coattails" of a much larger monetary transition. The early gold was real, as a grand purpose it did have and that purpose is complete. To this day these bullion houses and traders have not the idea why their
profits were of great size. A great show is made of their analysis and reason, as supply and demand is still on the side of selling say they! Little is seen, for they have completed the task of major rulers and the "coattails" offer "ride" no more. Today, their short gold paper is supported by governments and does move from coast to coast to retain value. It seems fools beget fools and this lineage is without end! For these, the old thoughts of out fathers will be as a new truth is to be learned. Now oil will rise and the world oil currency will rise by 100 times. How so will they now explain this new supply and demand, a demand so great, it must also, have come from the future, not the past! Think they this Swiss gold be for pawns? Not this modern gold. It be bid for by kings and queens as the ECB and BIS will be first and last.
For one year this paper gold residue is held, even as the lenders make good no more. This residue of 10,000 to 14,000 tonne will never see physical gold! Settle they be forced to do as BIS always clears it's name. Perhaps a loan of Euros at six dollarsUS to one Euro will help? With
gold at $3,000+ it be the smaller write-off, no?

Gold is held in many lands in pockets of wealthy men. In the future, only the poor sole will count his gold in paper terms, terms and dreams that blew into the wind.

"some hold the very sun and know little pain, for in true life, strong hands never burn"

We watch this new gold market together, yes?

thank you

THE NEW BULL MARKET!
Aristotle Hello!
Your post (4/19/99; 5:16:35MDT - Msg ID:4869) pointed out the most compelling part of his speech. As he said:
" Whatever the paper barrel prices end up each day becomes the de facto cash price for oil almost every day."
It brings to light a key component of how modern commodity values are set. No, not all items, just the most important ones. Paper oil, paper copper, paper gold, they all are manipulated much the way currencies are. Just understanding this to be true brings us closer to grasping how our new economic world works! Most young investors today, follow "technical analysis" and supply/demand" factors when studying the merits of commodity based companies (be they gold/silver stocks or oil stocks). Yet they become shocked to see these enterprises stumble as their product is manipulated, in the face of, what should be positive trends.
The old story always told us that real things rise in price as the currency is inflated. Yet, today the dollar has been inflated off the map and commodities fall in price. The old structure was changed not when the dollar became the chief reserve currency, but when it became the only
money that settled MAJOR commodities, worldwide. This trend began in the early 70s and has accelerated to the end time of today. In doing so, futures no longer responded to the underlying supply/demand of product, but reacted more so to the supply and demand for dollars!
I repeat. It has been the norm for world currency markets to be manipulated for many years. What we have come to today, is that major commodity futures are held and sold as a proxy for the underlying currency of the country of origin, not the actual product! This is abstract reasoning
for a modern world, I know. However, it is the only way you can inflate a world currency during a bull economic run without the citizens dumping it. In no small way gold and oil are very much part of this. They are so economized by the currency markets that the economy could shrink 50% and
their real value still must rise by a large multiple. Truly, we must understand that the demand for gold was off the charts years ago! Long before US citizens started their current coin buying spree. Oil and gold prices in US$ have fallen as investors have increasingly opted to carry the forward loans of these products instead of the actual item in storage. Again, this is how a government "economizes" a commodity by contracting it in "inflated currency" securities.
Now, today, we see the start of the greatest financial transition in history! That being, the collapse of a Global world currency reserve in terms of real things! Do not confuse this with the dollar strength against other money as all other world currency must by design be based on dollar
reserve and settlement. No, this downfall will come about as investors attempt to redenominate their commodity holdings into another reserve, the Euro! Why? Because the real value (and dollar price) of oil is about to be shown, worldwide as the Euro is given a major percentage of oil contract settlement! When events show how week the dollar truly is in oil terms, all other commodities will follow. Gold, the only true oil currency, will rise as never before! Many will
argue that this metal has no value for use at these new prices! True, for jewelry use it will be useless, but as the currency of Kings and wealthy citizens, it will be Priceless! The drama is about to begin!

Good Luck, my friend FOA

Modern Gold Standard!
Christine (4/20/99; 6:58:12MDT - Msg ID:4917)

Christine, hello again,
I don't think we will ever return to any form of the old gold standard, as it was constructed previously. Our financial world has grown far to complicated. Trade and commerce require a fast moving, self balancing system to retain the efficient use of labor and materials. Present digital currencies work very well in this new environment, except that they have evolved from and are based upon a dollar reserve standard. That reserve standard carries with it all of the past baggage of the old fixed rate exchange system (debts denominated in dollars world wide?). Only a general washout, with all that implies, will retrofit our present currency money system to match the class
act that free world trade is evolving into. Currently, the money war exists because the US/IMF wants everyone (trading partners) to lower trade margins (profits) to reflect the new economics of high speed free trade, while still maintaining payments on the old international dollar debts built up during protected trade. This has the effect of imploding native currencies and economic structures of countries trying to play the game in dollars but maintaining a local currency. We cannot have it both ways and something must give. Because all IMF/dollars are created with debt, all dollar denominated debt assets, worldwide, must be kept whole to maintain it's status as the world reserve currency. Therefore, retaining the dollar standard requires constant unbacked government to government dollar based loans so countries may make good on foreign debts. The IMF /
Federal reserve doesn't push of this just to maintain our trading partners, it's done to support the dollar reserve system.
Christine, any movement or perception that the world trading environment is moving away from dollar based trade settlement will begin a nuclear chain reaction of abandonment and repudiation of old dollar treasury debt that is held as a currency reserve! This is where this end
time political game becomes so intriguing. Many financial analysis have pegged the current international commodity deflation with the wrong identity. Falling prices in dollar terms are a direct result of a slow trend of abandonment of dollar reserve debt. Prices fall because the weight of
maintaining that reserve debt and it's part in the cost structure, is slipping away. If it was being serviced from profits, commodity production would be shutting down and product prices rising. The US/IMF rushes to lend money and the debt is being paid from the proceeds of these new
loans, not working capitol. Through this process the dollar is crashing, behind the seans, as we speak!
This is why the introduction (not it's current exchange rate) of the Euro was so important. It holds the position of a "backup" digital currency and will keep the world economic system on track when the dollar fails. Back to your original point; neither gold or the old gold standard could work as or with our present digital trading universe. What has and is evolving is a new gold currency that trades worldwide. It is manipulated just like all currencies. What we are
experiencing with gold is the building of "open gold currency trade" not "unmanipulated free gold trade" and it has taken twenty years to create. This open trade will be vital in supporting (read that backing) the massive capitol extensions the Euro will be required to service. When the dollar is replaced by the Euro, gold will be open traded (manipulated) into many thousands of Euros per ounce. That pricing will create the largest major currency reserve for the Euro System Central Banks. They will need it as their old dollar reserves will be destroyed. The present lawsuits against gold manipulation will truly fade away and be replaced with lawsuits against the huge taxes placed
on gold reserves worldwide. They will tax away 90% of these new profits just as they did the American oil companies.
Also:
At one point, a while back when the Euro looked like it would not be born, the possibility of gold being used as a partial payment (along with the dollar) in settlement of trade was very real. In this day and age, had the oil producers selected that option, world trade as we know it would have moved back 50 years as the currency system would never have kept up! World economic trade would have continued but the efficiencies of free trade using digital currencies would have been lost. Not to mention gold would have skyrocketed! Today, the low price of gold has enticed
many dollar holders to maintain their dollar reserve while buying gold to offset a potential dollars reserve status change. It is true that the cost of maintaining the dollar was very high as your paper barrel oil story has shown. However, gold was never purchased with current cash flow because (as so many people pointed out) they didn't have any. Oil reserves are easily used to purchase future delivery through the complicated world of "open manipulated gold trading". No doubt, much of that paper gold will be converted into a Euro package at the major expense and possible bankruptcy of modern gold traders.

Mr. Kosares,
Good evening. I see by this post (USAGOLD (4/23/99; 18:00:42MDT - Msg ID:5109) that you agree the Swiss still play all sides to their "shrewd advantage". Good minds have they. Nothing changes for them. A Swiss currency, heavily backed with gold would bankrupt their trade when that metal imparts strength to the Euro. They could not exist in a "new Euro dominated world" with their local currency much stronger than the Euro. They wished, from the beginning, to be part of the EMU when it takes hold of world commerce. Yet, they were locked from selling by the BIS as it stopped gold sales last year. Wait they must until the Euro was born, now sales proceed to ECB, in the open I suspect. If they do sell small portion into public market for political agenda, these sales will be neutralized with purchases by BIS at same time. You see, my friend, these sales are truly transfers of assets and will occur during a much rising gold price in dollar terms.
I do not think the Swiss think of the EMU as a swirl, much as do the Americans. Even Michael Kosares, perhaps? The new economic future of Switzerland will be tied directly with all of Europe. Please remember the Bank For International Settlements is very influenced by local
concerns, even the ground beneath their building is Swiss, no? Many traders in the West see the Euro as the failure after it's long life of four months. The BIS see it as a tremendous success that was to be created as only one to one against the dollar. The fact of initial opening months brought higher rate came about from other countries, as you say, "jumping the gun" with bids! Please consider what I have said long before, "the new gold market will begin after the dollar has increased against other currencies". This has now happened and process is complete and the gold price will fall no more. You will soon see gold begin to strengthen the Euro as the dollar continues into a mighty fall.
Many local citizens in Europe, including the Swiss, do not fully understand the Euro or the future benefits it will impart upon them. They do, as westerners also do, "vote pocketbook" with respect to current financial affairs. Only in times of change do ordinary persons take the time for
observing conditions. In that time, real changes they do make, these usually bring the disruption of currency markets. We must understand and consider that the EMU was done for Europe as a community, not for the World. The order of events will show that the dollar will now fail, first,
then all will race for Euro. During this race, that now begins, gold will rise in dollars and Euros for a short time. Then continue rise in dollars and fall in Euros. This action will influence Swiss voters in the positive way and allow for smooth sale of gold to ECB. It be their trade advantage to sell gold reserve for Euro reserves, all done in rising dollar gold market.
In many ways we did wish to see gold fall below $280us. It would have forced the BIS to openly buy to support price so as not to destroy the Euro package and drive producers into physical gold. Today, gold will actively rise as events expose it as the "new currency of reserve". This thought is much opposed to actions of private bullion traders and western public money creators. In the end, all is good, for this world does balance life and wealth. Every item of worth
lost from paper gold traders will add ten times to the assets of private citizens. Persons of real wealth, persons of gold!

NEW CURRENCY?
Hello Stranger,
I have read some of your thoughts (and many others here) and would like to commit on part of one.
"(4/23/99; 23:07:47MDT - Msg ID:5111)- Bullion banks normally arrange CBs to lend the gold and for mining companies to sell it. The gold is actually delivered to the buyer for ultimate fabrication into jewelry, coins,what-have-you. The mining company gets payment in full at settlement."


This is the basic concept most investors have about gold lending. It's not what is said but the perception that it creates that I must argue with!

During the last twenty or thirty years, the public has been conditioned to think of gold as a commodity only, not a currency or money. This conditioning was so well done that when people even consider gold as a financial refuge they view it as a "useful item" that can be traded for it's
commodity roll ( jewelry, coins,what-have-you) in tough times. The majority don't look at it as real exchangeable money, rather it's put into the same category as liquor or guns or soap. Something someone else needs for daily living. We never consider that gold may be wanted by the other person to use exclusively as money during hard times! Even the World Gold Council and the mining industry was taken to task for promoting this. See:


http://www.fame.org/fedwatch/fedwatch.htm
http://www.fame.org/famennews/ART-007.HTM

The Gold Mining Industry Shoots Itself in the Foot
"Because of an accident of fate, a large part of the gold mining industry has mistakenly spent almost a billion dollars over the past fifteen years promoting jewelry in an effort to stimulate gold demand."
" In the worst case, because it helped subvert the only use of gold that can possibly drive and
maintain its value —its monetary use"



The people at FAME saw the promotion for what it was, part of a broad based public disservice that helped create the misinformation printed today that is taken for fact! In the Stranger post above, we instantly see the gold leaving a CBs vault and heading for the Italian jewelry factories. If gold wasn't being traded as a currency / financial asset, we could accept this. However, one has only to understand that the commodity use for gold (jewelry and such) is easily
supplied by the yearly mine production! Yes, much of the mine gold is indeed sent to the fabrication yard. But, 99%++ of the financial gold never leaves the major vaults! Why should it? If a CB lends it's gold, it is indeed sold. A receipt is issued for it and a new owner holds that receipt. We have to understand that most of the financial gold is held in major depositories in NY, London, etc., even various nations reserves. If an investor buys 10 tonnes of gold from a CB lend / sale, why would he remove it? By far, most of the trading of gold today is done using deposit receipts. These receipts are indeed leveraged many times over by selling derivatives on the OTC markets. It's not a conspiracy, JA! By the way thanks for the definition. See:
((4/21/99; 18:23:47MDT - Msg ID:4988) Conspiracy theories).

What we are seeing is a new currency being managed as any other currency is. Listen to Greenspan:

http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/BOARDDOCS/TESTIMONY/19980730.htm

"Nor can private counterparties restrict supplies of gold, another commodity whose derivatives are often traded over-the-counter, where central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise."

I will quote that same item in another way. I say: Central banks stand ready to lease gold, using paper derivatives, issued by bullion banks, should the price rise. This action will stop private counterparties from managing gold.

Creates a different perception doesn't it? Truly, the fact that gold is traded worldwide, in such huge quantities, completely negates the current dogma that it is just a commodity. As the Privateer web site has said often, gold is barely even moving in price. I ask you, why would any investor be buying or trading gold in these huge amounts if it wasn't part of a currency financial asset? They
certainly are not buying it to sell to the jewelry shops, are are they? Let's review how much is traded daily:


http://www.usagold.com/wgc.html

"The latest net clearing statistics released by the London Bullion Market Association showed a 6% recovery in activity in March from the depressed levels of the previous month, with an average 28.5 million ounces (886 tonnes) of gold being transferred each day."


Notice they said "transferred". Now, any rational person will conclude that they are not placing 886 tonnes on ships and planes. Obviously they are talking about warehouse receipts for physical. Again, the world is not producing this much gold chain to justify 28 million ounces, a day in sales!

So why are they trading it in these amounts? Can we consider / commit on this for a while? I'll be back a little later. Thanks for reading, FOA

Hello CoBra,
You are right about this: "The gold lease game is just another over leveraged or pyramid scheme or scam feeding the paper casino bubble"! That is exactly what some of it became. But not all of this trading is by gamblers / traders. A very good portion of it is government CB money
management used to balance reserves against paper currency. Just as the days are gone when governments print paper currency outright to manage monetary policy, gone also are the days of outright public sales of gold. Even with all the discussion of CB gold sales these past few years, one has only to check the World Gold Council site and see that not that much gold was taken out of CB procession. Most of the sales were just redistributed between governments. And who is to know how much of the actual sales were purchased by other major entities as a currency wash?
Now, gold is going to be forced up by the same players that needed it down. Yes, the shorts will most likely create a major market problem as they are liquidated with Euro loans to pay off gold loans, but that is not the major economic play here! Gold will rise as the dollar gets
imploded, setting the stage for a reserve currency transition. It is starting now, today, this hour, as we speak. As I mentioned in an earlier post a few days ago, the IMF / dollar engine is shutting down. Just look at M3 money supply GROWTH, straight down! The IMF must quickly find
liquidity through government gold sales to support dollar debt reserves held in other countries. If not, the dollar will be destroyed in a nuclear currency event. By selling gold receipts, they can leverage the those assets ten times plus, using derivatives. That money will be used as loan
collateral. Ever wonder why we never see the physical trail of the real gold assets? It's because they never move the gold, just free it up to write derivatives against it in the OTC market.
Who will gain from this? Anyone that has leveraged dollar reserves into gold derivatives reserves that will be bailed out using Euros! Not to mention that gold will soar into the thousands. I wonder what entities would have purchased so much gold?

Christine,
Your statement: " Is the currency war really about how many of the oil states are going to switch to the euro for oil settlements. The oil states understandably want higher profit margins. Perhaps the euro/BIS is willing to provide that. Of course the IMF/US dollar wants the oil
settlements and the profits. "

No, it's not just "profit margins" that will drive the switch. It's total worldwide demand. If the IMF / dollar group continued with past currency policies, we would be looking at a financial depression that would destroy oil demand for years to come. In order to maintain dollar reserve credibility, every other country in the world would have to slowly convert into a dollar standard.
That was the only outcome from a policy of saving all debt denominated in dollars! As anyone should realize, the end of that trail would be dark, indeed!
In order to maintain some form of world economic function, the BIS and Europe embarked upon a plan to build not only an alternative currency, but an alternative "economy". Not much different than the US enjoys presently in the mist of financial turmoil. It was long ago known that
the only way a financial system could be build opposing the dollar would be to base it upon gold, as traded in an open market. Not a gold standard or a gold reserve system, but upon a reserve asset valued in a open world trading concept. This would allow any country to add reserves without draining the money supply from it's trading partners, as the "gold exchange standard" did.
True, the dollar does hold gold in national form, but, it's corresponding debt overhang will never allow that gold reserve to balance currency in circulation. As the dollar falls, hyperinflation will most definitely be required by the US treasury as a last gasp attempt at survival. More likely than not, the US will be selling it's gold to the ECB for Euros before this is over.
Back on the subject of oil demand, what good is economic demand for oil if the payment settlement is worthless? Better to support a low gold price to create a new currency than risk a total loss of oil usage. A complicated game involving many players. It always does when largest trading reserve currency in the world is about to be replaced.

Allies Order Military To Plan Oil Embargo Russia Refuses to Stop Shipments; France Backs Off Its Objections


By Joseph Fitchett International Herald Tribune

WASHINGTON - The NATO summit meeting, apparently united in its determination to cut oil supplies reaching Serbia, told the alliance's military commander to work out plans to interdict ships carrying oil to Serbia via the Adriatic sea, U.S. officials said Sunday.

The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that this new action to isolate Belgrade had enough backing in the alliance to ensure that effective steps would be taken, using the U.S. and European warships patrolling the region.

Objections to an embargo, spearheaded by France, reflected fears of a clash with Moscow if NATO sought to halt and search Russian ships at sea, but U.S. and British officials played down the risk of a major confrontation.

The British defense secretary, George Robertson, said: ''The idea of refueling the Serb machine is not really on the Russian agenda at the moment.'' Privately, British and U.S. officials at the summit meeting said that Moscow seemed to be tiring of public challenges to NATO exposing Russian weakness in the crisis.

President Boris Yeltsin spoke at length about the Kosovo conflict withPresident Bill Clinton in a telephone conversation Sunday, apparently without signaling any intention to defy NATO over the oil issue, said Samuel
(Sandy) Berger, the national security adviser.
Before that conversation, the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said on Russian television: ''There are only 19 member countries in NATO, and NATO's decisions extend only to those countries that are a part of the alliance. According to international law, sanctions or embargoes can be imposed only by the UN Security Council.''

Speaking to reporters in Cairo, where he was visiting, Mr. Ivanov added: ''We will continue delivering oil in keeping with our international commitments.''

Although the French reportedly agreed to the plan to tighten the economic noose on Belgrade when it was discussed at the start of the summit meeting, President Jacques Chirac later warned publicly that a blockade would bean ''act of war'' - apparently a reference to Russia, where officials threatened publicly to continue supplying Serbia with oil. Russia has been the main supplier for Serbia, and U.S. officials said that they thought Moscow might try to continue getting some oil to Belgrade along the Danube River route.

Later, at a news conference at the French Embassy in Washington, Mr.Chirac said that there were ''no divergences among the allies'' about action to halt deliveries of oil products to Yugoslavia. His remarks appeared to indicate that he was satisfied that his concerns had been allayed in the closing hours of the summit meeting.

When asked about French and other reservations on the embargo, Mr. Clinton defended the plan energetically. ''How can we justify risking the lives of the pilots,'' he said, and ''then say, 'But it's O.K. with us if people want to continue to supply this nation and its outlaw actions in Kosovo in another way?'''

I believe this entire scenario was the work of very sharp people. As Another once put it, "it is the master plan"! They launched this fully, during the present administration in washington which has lasted almost two terms. Think about it, the present US political factions wanted the dollar to be strong at all cost in order to push through their economic plans. What better bait than to lay
down a dollar strengthening decline in gold? The US went for it with both feet and encouraged it from the beginning! Perhaps you are right, in that they even helped the process. Truly, they never thought the Euro would fly and even considered that this dollar building scheme, would help kill
the new currency before it launched. It must have been the biggest shock when it was realized what a trap was laid. Maybe you are also right that this brought on the war?
I think the US thought most of the European CBs would be on the hook for all the gold derivatives once the Euro failed. Now the whole thing is reversed. The US must figure out how to negate all of the gold paper without lowering the dollar in the world's eyes with a soaring gold price!
Oh yes, they knew about oil. But, so what? If the LBMA assignments were lost because of a failing Euro, who was going to suffer a loss of confidence? Europe of course, but the Euro succeeded! The game continues! FOA

Aragorn III (4/26/99; 6:49:34MDT - Msg ID:5170)
My thoughts for a new day, complete with plenty of typos and poor grammar!
Canamami asks the good question "The US possesses massive (I believe over 50% of the world's) gold reserves. What country or group in its right mind would start an economic war against the US, using gold as a significant weapon, in the face of such awesome US reserves? [...]to me it implies the equivalent of an economic war against the US[...]"

Perhaps, do not try to think in terms of an act of war, but instead in terms of an act of liberation. When the money has gone bad, the "committee to save the world" grew out of the efforts of self-preservation. Why does efforts toward the return to a clear monetary role for gold gain scorn and scepticism as an economic aggression leveled at the body of the U.S., when it is only the dead U.S. currency (along with all others) that is being replaced in favor of a live one. Should we not rather place our focus on the "act of war" the U.S. Govt declared, waged, and has won since it first ceased domestic convertibility in 1933, followed by the blitzkrieg in 1971 to end its obligations to international settlements of trade in real money?

True, the U.S. does report to hold over 8,000 tonnes of the world's 33,000 found in the official sector. But as all nations must look to their gold to "square the books" against outstanding issue of currency and debt, the U.S. is seen to hold much, much more than is easily covered even by so much gold. A single pat of butter for a large loaf indeed! Again, this need not be viewed as a personal attack against the U.S., as all nations will be under the same prospect whereby gold will "prove" their currency. But the focus naturally goes to the U.S., for it has been left in poorest position through the very same actions by which it reaped such great rewards for nearly three decades--buying the world's goods with numbers written on paper.

Please consider excerpts from this only days ago: Aragorn III (4/24/99; 17:14:16MDT - Msg ID:5123)
"As the framework for world economics was deteriorating by a failing [reserve] currency, it was in the interest of those having the most to lose to circumvent the problem--that the real supply of dollars was outpacing real supply of goods. This fed upon itself as ever more dollars were created, borrowed into existance for purchase of goods today by those who saw that their future production would easily repay these loans. (It was not to be, as we can see how many nations now struggle under a debt despite the hard work and good production of commodities valued by life the world-over.)
The solution was found for the dollar's problem through the alteration ... supply and demand pricing of key commodities was moved to the futures markets where the goods are but promises also.
This past vicious circle: borrowing many dollars with the prospect of easy repayment with future production, was now effectively replaced with an equally vicious circle: selling much future production (on paper) with the prospect of easy replacement (on paper) with future dollars in an "oversupplied" market!
In consequence, all those that borrowed easily have found that repayment has been hard, even as real demand for their products have grown! And further development takes a back seat to debt service."

Also, consider an excerpt from this post: Aragorn III (3/25/99; 3:23:55MDT - Msg ID:3827)
"What folly is it to suggest that a body [OPEC] is impoverished that commands a position atop a commodity [oil] needed the world over? Impoverished, no. In dire need of contract renegotiation to undo past [currency] mismanagement? Yes. Much like the United States renegotiated its debts in 1971 by saying "no more gold shall be paid to settle accumulated dollar-denominated debts". Dollars at that point became very cheap and easy to come by. OPEC is in the position to do likewise, though they will say "no more OIL will be paid to settle accumulated dollar-denominated debts". By pricing oil in euros, the U.S. will find that euros are not easy to obtain as the U.S. is a net importing nation. And what more need will any net exporting nation have for U.S. Dollars as balance of trade when oil requires euros? Suddenly, the outside world is not eager to accept any few dollars for its real products. Exchange rate of the dollar falls, and all countries use these newly cheap dollars to settle all accumulated dollar-denominated debts. That is the exit strategy of nations. The U.S. will be at a disadvantage until it achieves meaningful balance of trade. It cannot continue to print its primary export value. This will not kill the future demand for oil. The world is a much larger place than 50 united States, and any group of nations would be equally happy to rise to the occasion to be the fat consumer of of last resort.
These are the few remaining days of easy money. I suggest you use them wisely. Here's a hint...gold is the universal currency."

We can see that the struggle for a fair and viable currency walks hand in hand with the effort to revitalize global trade and economic development.

Further, I have read the various comments attempting to represent this as a battle of wits and wills of the "evil" IMF/dollar powers against the "evil" BIS/euro powers. This is not to be, as we see many players to be on both teams!
Think instead of the monetary structures being pitted against each other, as only one will win, while the men behind the scenes work both sides. Let us take a look...

The IMF sprang to life in 1947 out of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. The purpose of the IMF was to RETURN the international settlements to a GOLD STANDARD! When this was ended by the U.S. in 1971, the IMF evolved to oversee and facilitate the wayward system of currency exchanges in a global fiat system of currencies. Of its 182 member nations today, the EMU 11 represent 22.4% of the voting shares, while notably the U.K. has 5%, the U.S. has 17.5%, Switzerland has 1.6% and Saudi Arabia has 3.3%. The IMF currently has eight of its 24 Executive Directors representing individual countries: China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The other 16 represent regions. Its Board consists of such notable Governors and Alternates as Hans Tietmeyer and Hans Eichel of Germany, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Jean-Claude Trichet of France, Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, Gordon Brown and Edward A.J. George of United Kingdom, Hans Meyer of Switzerland, Paul Martin of Canada, etc... and its managing director is a Frenchman. The IMF Accounting Unit, the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as of April 23, 1999, SDR 1 equaled US$1.35327 and is calculated from this basket of currency: USDollar 39%, Deutsche Mark 21%, Japanese Yen 18%, Pound Sterling 11%, French Franc 11% (Since the launch of EMU, the euro has replaced the currency amounts of the deutsche mark and the French franc in the SDR valuation basket.) Clearly, the euro world is well represented in the IMF.

Let us take a briefer look at the BIS. As excerpted from their documents, "The Board of Directors comprises the Governors of the central banks of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, as ex officio members, each of whom appoints another member of the same nationality. The Statutes also provide for the election to the Board of not more than nine Governors of other member central banks. The Governors of the central banks of Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland are currently elected members of the Board."

I hope this proves helpful for further discussions, as much time can be spared from the speculation why IMF does not "fight the good fight" against the BIS. They once had much in common managing gold currency, but of necessity the IMF's role grew apart, even as the governors remained the same.

This "battle" may be oversimplified as a selection of monetary systems...of gold assets versus fiat currencies. Gold wins this one. No more. No less.

You see this world with eyes much stronger than mine. I think the years of time does wear the truth from ones vision. My thoughts once were strong for things that benefit all people. Now I view only with the logic of what is "feasible" under current conditions. It is the sad conclusion of a life brought to reality, yes?
The interaction of productive peoples, of many cultures, does require an economic function of
"broad scale". The choice for this day in time does not include the best solution for monetary ills, rather it be the selection that offers most economic production for all nations. The irony does prove that the currency platform I support be also the structure upon which we all will stand.
Most will seek out this position as the "free choice" not "forced choice".
You say, " I believe it will be detrimental to us all here". Perhaps, some will walk "the lower road", but many will rise from the shallows of economic despair. For most of this world, life itself is the "detrimental" journey that brings a yearning to walk "the higher road" that some consider low. Truly, our eyes will join to view this change that must come.

were never fully achieved, as reality always dictated the final agreements. Yes, the US was
founded "upon principles of freedom, not principles of prosperity", but these components are truly
convoluted in that country today! I believe that people evolve and resolve there highest goals as
reality dictates. Where paper money today is, at best, only a receipt for your life efforts savings,
surely society will reach for the something different. Sometimes, even something a little different is
a major change.
The dollar will fall from it's own weight of unpayable debt. That fall will occur because people
will exercise their "individual responsibility and freedom" and grasp for the next best "existing"
system. Hopefully, that system will continue to allow for a world wide "open trading" gold market.
Will it's price still be manipulated in Euros? Personally, I don't care, as long as I may buy physical

I think the IMF gold sale has been worked out already. Any further public statements are just political posturing. The term "sales" is indeed misleading and true words like "leveraging assets to provide further loan guarantees" will never be used. Aristotle, gold is now the last asset and the
US / IMF factions are going to have to make it rise to provide liquidity. As I said before, the BIS and it's European / other allies have (for the past year or so) blocked any further lowering of the gold price. If the US wants to protect it's remaining dollar reserve viability, (by maintaining all foreign dollar reserve debt) it now must allow it to depreciate against gold to provide liquidity.
That, my friend is the only avenue left for them! This will, as Another has pointed out, drive assets to the other new reserve system. As I mentioned to Christine, national entities will have a choice as will you and I and Christine. That being, stay with a falling dollar or move into Euros and gold.

Aristotle (4/28/99; 0:56:40MDT - Msg ID:5259)

Aristotle,
When the BIS stopped gold sales and leasing (that largely benefited major dollar reserve holders, such as oil) a year or so ago, many of the CB heads thought the public gold shorts would cover and create a minor liquidity crunch in the gold market. That action could have driven physical upwards into $340, $360, $370?? Many gambler investors "coat tailed" that private information and went paper long. However, the dollar supporters managed to roll over all of the paper shorts and leveraged even more shorts on top of that. In essence, as Another said, the paper moved from coast to coast, just turning over! Actually, this has played even further into the hands of the BIS as this turnover has created much more fuel to unwind the dollar through gold strength! As I said in my last post, the US now must accept a "diminished" reserve status for the dollar, if it is to maintain any reserve competition against the Euro. This "new acceptance" comes in the form of throwing the paper gold shorts to the dogs and actively pushing up gold!
Watch the open interest on comex, over the next monthS, it should start a rise that will blow people away!
400,000 OI+ will be the result of small shorts trying to hedge by going long. Notice I said hedge, not cover, as covering is out of the question as the IMF and Swiss gold will never hit the streets! Also notice I said "small shorts", as the big players are now "politically shut out" and will eventually be liquidated with cash settlement in a "going out of business sale"!
Yes, inflation will roar as gold rises perhaps 30 times or more. It's going to be a dynamic process that will make investing in the stock market look "small time'.

Tomcat (4/28/99; 7:13:58MDT - Msg ID:5262)

Tomcat,
Hello! I just read your post and have a question. The dollar is a function of digital creation just as all other national currencies are. 90%+ of all currencies are digital blips. If a foreign national finds his local banks / economy shut down or failing because of Y2K, how will he exchange /
transfer his money into an operating US bank? Conversely, if that person has saved himself by placing their assets into a dollar account at a US bank, beforehand, how will he bring this money home for self sustaining purchases / investing if Y2K has destroyed the local digital banking system?

Also! Please understand that the dollar exists as a world reserve currency because all dollar denominated reserve debt (treasury and others included) is maintained through timely interest and principal payments. This servicing of reserve debt requires a "functioning" foreign exchange system, whereby foreign currencies can be converted into dollars for payment. No payment
brings debt default and dollar reserve destruction. Exactly why the IMF never writes off foreign dollar debt! Big time Y2K will bring big time dollar destruction! Physical gold will be much better as history and recent world events have shown that real gold can and does trade worldwide
"without" a functioning exchange market or banking system! Also, the tremendous increase in gold values that Y2K would bring would more than offset any loses of paper reserves that currently makeup the ECB system. Their debt is not held worldwide as a reserve function for the Euro. The ECB "System Banks" could eventually reopen with a manual gold based Euro currency. So could the dollar, but at a greatly reduced function as the ratio of dollar destruction as a factor of gold reserves is far out of balance!

Michael Kosares (Usagold),
I just read your "The Fifth Horseman" piece on the Gilded Opinion page. Very nice write-up, indeed! With crude rising some $.60 yesterday, it looks as though we are beginning a new era of commodity pricing. I think that most people have completely forgotten just what an impact oil
prices can have on inflation. Just as you write,

" This Fifth Horseman could very well be the most
intimidating of them all", also I add, so will it be an intimidation on the dollar! Another fine point is
also made with

" What makes the current situation more dangerous than the 1970s, as shown in Chart 2, is that during the 1970s the United States imported roughly 20% of its oil. We now import nearly 60%".

The pricing changes, that such a percentage disparity suggests, will deflate many portfolios. When the asset shift begins it will be of a "historic proportion" and require long hours of discussion on this forum.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, spearheaded the March agreement.
http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/990429/62.html
ALL: "only one oil producer counts, only one" The political picture is changing and it will impact gold!

Thursday April 29, 12:31 pm Eastern Time

By Michael Georgy

DUBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is certain that OPEC and oil producers outside the group will fully comply with output cut pledges made under a March agreement to rescue petroleum prices, a Gulf source said on Thursday.

\`\`Saudi Arabia is sure that there will be a 100 percent compliance in May, and for the rest of the year,'' the Gulf source told Reuters.

\`\`What has to be taken into account is that there is a new spirit of cooperation among all of the countries (OPEC and non-OPEC), like Oman, Mexico and Norway. Anything that is done will be done collectively,'' added the source, who is familiar with Saudi thinking.

He said Saudi Arabia did not expect any violations of the agreement, even if prices, which have shown recovery since the deal was signed, rose further.

\`\`Saudi Arabia is not very worried,'' he said, when asked if there was danger if prices rose too quickly.

\`\`We are trying to bring balance back to the market, to bring stock levels to normal levels of 1996 and 1997. We are dealing more with fundamentals,'' said the Gulf source of oil producers.

June international benchmark Brent traded at $16.35 by 1300 GMT on Thursday, down five cents from Wednesday's close.

The Gulf source said Saudi Arabia believes compliance in April was \`\`high'' but declined to give a figure, saying accurate judgment of implementation of the pact could only be made one week or so after the month ended.

\`\`Maybe there was not full compliance because of contract problems. But Saudi Arabia thinks compliance was high. There is no point in guessing now,'' he said.

OPEC and other producers in March agreed to remove 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) from glutted world oil markets in a third bid to prop up prices since last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, spearheaded the March agreement.

Violations of previous pacts undermined efforts to rescue prices, which hit 12-year lows in the months before the March agreement.

Analysts have said the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) seemed to have complied with the cuts so far and would continue to do so for the short term.

According to preliminary data from consultants, OPEC cut oil production by 1.35 million bpd in April after agreeing to the new limits that took effect at the start of the month. That translates into 81 percent compliance.

The Gulf source rejected those assessments, saying it was impossible to accurately track all loadings from ports and make a judgment before the month in question ended.

\`\`Some people like to create doubts whatever OPEC does. They are negative. If we talk about guessing, I can guess what oil production will be two years from now,'' he said.

Gold
ALL,
I am watching Comex gold trading now, because this should be the place where local (US based) funds attempt to reduce their exposure to any future rise in gold (perceived or other wise).
Private investment funds, that have raised capitol through any form of gold short securities, may be asked to expose their "risk". The full group of investment entities may also be expanded to include "any" other parties that have dealings or actual exposure to these funds that are short. In essence, every major player in the gold market could be looking for a way to "neutralize" their books to scrutiny. Even though your exposure may have come from the unregulated part of the OTC world gold market, if one is "hedged long" on a "politically acceptable" exchange, then your
position is "politically not at risk"! The books stay closed.

So why watch Comex, open interest? If a certain political faction suddenly changed direction and wanted to revalue gold as an asset to lend money against, the fasted way to do it is to drive currency traders into the paper gold traded on comex. When looked at in this light, gold takes on a very different appearance than the commodity we thought it was. Think about it and perhaps we can discuss this further.
If you notice, on Thursday, Comex gold traded app.. 45,000 contracts and rose $3.00+. Yet the OI dropped 11,000+. Today, a friday, some 60,000 (estimated) contracts were traded and it rose $.50. This general trend should continue, in that every time there is a major closing of
speculative positions, the next day should show high volume. The major players are taking advantage of shorts closing and buying "insurance". Over the next months, OI should increase
greatly! We will watch and learn. FOA

Michael,
Hello again! I'll reprint the item you committed on:

"This points to the odd circumstances that require America to free up gold through the IMF so they can benefit. Whereas, the ECB has but to only let the price rise!

When one puts on a political thinking cap, that statement does say a lot! Why else would the ECB establish a precedent of routinely "marking to the market" their gold (and the gold of the Euro System banks also). Then add to that your remark of:

"becomes clear that this is a very risky business and that they are being asked to sacrifice their
gold to defend another country's currency."

Suddenly, we see who's gold was really at risk, all along! Are we in the last days of the dollar, as the US agrees to politically drive gold higher to benefit the IMF? And by extention, world dollar reserves as expressed in dollar debt! Will the US be forced to drive it's own dollar down against gold in an attempt to save it's reserve status? Dynamic times, indeed!

Hello JA,
I see your point. Much of what I have said is in the context of a much larger point. That is, that gold never did become a commodity just because the dollar was taken off the gold standard. It's used as a currency to buy "credibility", influence events and provide financing for speculative
investments. Much in the same way as companies use their stock as currency, so do governments use gold! Say a company knew of a major break thru that would eventually increase it's stock value many times. Then, say they offered you that stock to purchase your natural resources at what appears to be a ridiculous price. All of your piers think you are nuts to take the offer, until the company stock explodes in price. Then it looks as if your sale was appropriate! This scenario happens every day, yet, the stock isn't called a currency and the deal isn't looked upon as a conspiracy.

My point is that some people still look at gold as a currency that is so undervalued it's ridiculous. They accept it with the (inside?) knowledge that the dollar is going to plunge. Not because politicians will force it down, but because politicians have forced it up for so long. The
true conspiracy was in the dollar reserve standard, not gold.

The world often values things wrongly, because people as a group invest using their present life experiences as a guide. They learn using a continuation of "present trends" established during their short existence, instead of allowing the real results of history to teach them. The present lawsuit by mine stock owners is a good example. It's not about gold, but about getting their money back
because they invested using the wrong "interpretation" about gold. They did not think it would be managed as a currency, because they thought it was a commodity! Now, as the gold currency is sought after by many, as a replacement for a failing dollar, they will find themselves wrong again.
Will they then bring legal powers to bear as gold soars from manipulation by the buying public?

All: please reread #5431 as my reply is for this post.

Hello canamami,
I am happy that your reading here has prompted a further break in said "posting moratorium"!The thoughts and reflections of others help everyone to view the world in a different light. Our bodies are not engineered to see 360 degrees at once. Therefore, at any moment in time,
someone else will always see something hidden by our lack of complete visual perception.

For, myself, Mr. Donald Coxe displays the same style of thinking that has cost many investors dearly during the 90s. He correctly states "gold has been a reliable inflation indicator for at least four millennia" but then associates the correct investment plan to play this "historical precedent" was to hold "precious metal stocks"! Search the western world of investment professionals and we will find the exact same thinking in almost every case. Billions of dollars have been lost using this very style of "association", yet even in the face of these loses, they will still buy shares instead of gold bullion. Why? Because every holder of modern currency is using their present "life trend experiences" to dictate the possible future value of gold! Even the well written history of paper
money, with all of it's chronicled destruction, cannot convince modern man that Gold can and will fully demoney paper! In our present lifetime! Yes, these shrewd trust managers can only accept that the value of gold will only increase to it's commodity value plus a premium for inflation. Hence they buy into the commodity story of gold and hold shares.

Standing upon a hill and looking in the same direction, none of them will view the other 180 degrees of history that is quickly approaching them. Today, the IMF appeals to the governments to use gold as a currency. It will be sold, yet no buyers will be listed! The books will be squared and show 10 million less gold, yet none of it has left the vaults. The bullion is "securitized" and multiplied into billions of loan guarantees, yet we only hear that it was sold to feed hungry people. During the past few years, millions and millions of ounces are leased, loaned and borrowed with
only four or five hundred tonnes shown as deleted from total worldwide CB books, yet we are told they are selling it completely.

Yes, my friend, gold is returning to it's centuries old roots, as it is used as the last resort for financing in a failing debt ravaged, outdated currency reserve system. I submit, that managing the price of gold lower has helped create, what the gentleman has pointed out, as the "rapid money supply growth and some of the lowest interest rates the world has seen". That effort has got us this far today without a currency collapse. The "influence" of low gold created the energy to effect this present state of affairs. Now, that energy has been used up. Now, gold will be managed UP in a final washout of the dollar. Holding physical gold, now will provide a return in proportion to it's past position as "the asset class".

This act will play out again today, just as history dictates. In reference to your post, I add:

The "Good Guy" will "get the girl", "win the lottery" and "never have to make a profit doing it! All because he (she) was dumb enough to hold gold!

You give these world leaders a lot of credit for knowing all about gold! My problem is that your credit to them is out of context. Any smart politician will never act to build on a system that denies "money creation". That is the mind set they apply to gold, and for them, the only one that counts. It, by nature, works against their agenda. Just as in my post to canamami (#5439), I again submit that most major western leaders want to use "gold the commodity" as an "asset creation" mechanism for their constituency benefit, not for the creation of a stable financial reserve. Always, when a politician is under pressure, they think of gold in the "present trend", it's a commodity that we can borrow from. Just don't let it into our house to control us.

This is where we are, today. The demand for gold from entities that want to remove dollars from reserves is creating a "piggy bank" for dollar / IMF countries to borrow from. Your supposedly, knowledgeable leaders don't understand that they are using the last asset in line.
Truly, they will be very surprised to learn when the gold they "sold", so to speak, was loaned out so very cheaply. But, fear not, it will be the other gold "in the ground" that they will not be so dumb not to attach! FOA

Local US investors will do well investing in almost any useful, needed, exportable basic product. Many an investment

Hello SteveH,
Yes, Steve, you have it about right. I have to admit that money will be made in gold stocks. They will move until action is taken against them. The problem is that anyone that would truly understand and agree that physical gold will return much more, would have to say, why bother with stocks? I offer these guideline problems (Tomcat!) to watch in a functional way.

We are dealing with two phases that will impact gold stocks. The first will be the falling world stock markets in general, particularly the US. The decline, this time, will not be like in the 70s when gold and metal stocks went up as the markets fell. This downturn will be the result of a
"collapse" of the reserve currency system and the resulting "strategic repositioning of assets" worldwide. Indeed, a big difference from a (70s) falling equity market as a result of relatively minor inflation (13%). This new downturn will slam all equity investments, no matter WHAT they are earning! It will not matter if a gold stock is earning $10 a share and selling for $10, no one will hang around for the story, or the return, or the perceived ownership of gold. History shows that in such conditions people grab what they have and take it home, for a long time! The problem for
gold stock investors, this time, is that they are waiting for the very event that will impact the markets the most! That being the driving of gold prices higher in a gasping attempt to save the last of the dollar system! That act will crater the DOW from these levels. With Gold stocks, so
depressed, the higher gold prices will take at least six months to filter through into earnings in a meaningful way. If you were a big player in gold equities would you hold on for months with rumors of: foreign exchange controls, state of emergency, new banking regulations. a 50% drop in the dow, a currency crisis and gold flying through $3,000+?
Steve, watch the xau for a small rise, then a stall as things unfold. If it stalls for several weeks as matters worsen, you know what to do!

The next phase of problems for gold equities will come after gold crosses it's old high of $800! No doubt, foreign exchange controls will lock gold into the local market. The country of origin. Yes, the commodity every gold equity investor has followed supply and demand for will now
suddenly become classified as a "currency" and subject to all emergency measures. Remember, the governments will not coin it because it's a commodity, but during an emergency, it's much to valuable a currency asset to allow it to leave the country. Now, locked into a domestic market it's
sources will be subject to "windfall profits taxes" of sufficient amounts as to match the scale of the financial crisis. Steve, at this point there is nothing to watch because, if you still hold gold stocks, it's to late. Sorry for this very real discussion. Now you may consider your moves. FOA

Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan arrived Saturday in Iran on a groundbreaking visit that could bring the two Gulf heavyweights closer to a defense agreement.

Sultan, who arrived in Tehran late Saturday, is making the first visit to Iran by a Saudi defense minister since the country's 1979 Islamic revolution.

Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Sultan's visit was "a turning point in relations" between the two countries and called for a military pact with Saudi Arabia to defend the Gulf, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

The defense ministers will discuss "the general outline of a security plan for the region," said Iran's ambassador to Riyadh, Mohammad Reza Nouri Shahroudi.

A Saudi diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility the two sides would draw up a defense agreement. "

The fact that he made this statement was indeed a confirmation of the "changing analysis" of the gold market:
"Since gold has been a reliable inflation indicator for at least four millennia, weakening its price at a time of soaring oil prices is politically smart. It will help convince economists and central bankers that disinflation or even deflation is still at work, despite rapid money supply growth and some of the lowest interest rates the world has seen."

BOE gold sale!!
ALL:
A quick post, then I must go.
The decision by the UK Treasury to sell gold, points strongly towards the severe political pressures upon the IMF / Dollar Reserve factions! The "dollar reserve system" is truly in trouble. With the IMF gold sales in doubt, or delayed. And the EURO / BIS factions blocking any new gold. New gold cannot be found to maintain the backing of collateral for existing paper shorts and the massive liquidity they provide. The UK is directly in the middle of this as the LBMA would all but "disappear" if world dollar liquidity were to shrink from a higher gold price!

Notice what the Bank Of England said: "It also said that eligible bidders will be limited to members of the London Bullion Market Association and central banks and monetary institutions holding gold accounts with the Bank of England." Truly, the IMF / Dollar faction alliance is
failing, with each now about to support it's own entities! The BOE will most definitely back the LBMA first and foremost with fresh collateral!

The beginning of this new bull market in gold will be mired with "extreme" volatility! We never expected anything different. With the ending of the largest circulating reserve currency system about to ensue, nothing less than an investment in "actual gold bullion" will work. For some time, Another (and myself) have pointed out that no one will be able to play this change using any form of leverage!!! Major gold buyers and investors know this, especially oil producers and holders of "paper gold backed by the Euro CBs"! . Today's action, will be nothing compared to the swings to come, as these moves will be "political" attacks of a timed nature. There purpose is "NOT" to destroy private "paper gold" investors", rather "to respond to an ongoing currency crisis"!

This is perhaps the "Third" reason for not holding gold stocks (see my first two in FOA (5/1/99; 21:04:42MDT - Msg ID:5465)). Each 20% gain in the XAU will be given back with the swings in the physical market. Again, during a currency crisis, hold currency, but, in a gold currency crisis, hold gold!

BOE!
ALL,
Well, by now everyone must be aware of the "open management" of the gold price. "Another" had been bringing this picture to light long ago. In puzzle form, he offered ideas, Thoughts and directions for consideration. Only a short time ago most analysts completely wrote off such
"thinking" as being absolutely "on the fringe of reality"! Today, the "absolute fact" is that gold is used and managed as a "world currency" of major importance. After the BOE announcement on Friday, currency traders are grasping the concept that gold is, as never before "at the center of
reality"!

Many different factions are maneuvering gold these days, and each has their own agenda. The IMF / dollar faction, many years ago, went along with Europe in lowering the gold price in dollar terms. It made the dollar look stable and enforced it's continued use as the "currency of settlement" for strategic commodities. Any country running a balance of trade surplus of dollars, was free to buy gold at a stable to lower price, and partially replace the paper dollar reserves. Because the dollar is the "world reserve currency" many countries ran dollar surpluses with trading partners outside of the US. In this light we can see how the integrity of the dollar was expanded, even in countries of nonnative dollar origin!

Not only was physical gold purchased, but paper gold with distant CB backing was also accepted. Ever wonder how all of this gold was placed? You see, over the last many years, there has been a quiet boom going on in gold ownership. The sheer number of world gold buyers has
more than doubled, along with the amount of gold owned! The problem is that the amount of physical gold in existence has not doubled, only the warehouse receipts.

Most of it never, ever left the vaults, as the true placement was done in receipt form. Yes, slowly, over the years, even major private bullion holders offered up their physical for "convoluted, future delivered, leased and released gold". Much of what is now held is little more
than a form of gold options for "future deposit". Not unlike the "cash dollar that is supposed to be in your bank", but really isn't? As the bank only holds your deposit as a "credit" to your account, so is much of the world traded gold "only a credit of account"!

When Central Banks (mostly the European, at first) began to lease / lend gold, they were beginning what was to become "the master plan". The creation of a broad, liquid paper gold market that would ulltementally undermine the dollar, in time. As I said above, initially it was offered as an "appeasement" for continued dollar use. However, even the IMF / dollar faction never expected the successful creation of another competing reserve currency, the Euro! Right up
to it's offering, the political money was on the side of a complete failure, 100% with ten to one odds.

Not only did they lose, the Euro even accepted a percentage of gold as Euro reserves. If that wasn't enough, the ECB also instituted a policy of "marking to the market" it's gold reserves and effectively blocking any new sales or leases. These actions, as subtle and misunderstood as they
were have had the effect of officially making gold money again. Yes, this new broadly traded paper gold market, standing side by side with the physical market has become a world currency.

The problem this creates for the IMF / dollar is that most, if not all of this new gold market is settled in dollars! Dollars that broke a contract with the world in 1971 and went off the "gold exchange standard" at $41 to the ounce. The same dollar reserve currency that is not supported when the gold price rises. If the ECB does nothing but stand firm by not allowing physical out of it's vaults, the dollar will be trapped by gold. The US treasury cannot use gold as a backing reserve as the ECB does, because the BIS would claim it at $41 to settle trade imbalances. They
have that authority and as such it leaves the US the only option of outright gold sales. However, with the dollar as "the" reserve currency, we can expect many nations to bid "aggressively" for any US gold. China, among others comes to mind! That is what America found when they tried to auction it's gold in 1978. The Euro carries no such baggage.

This all leaves us in the present political situation, where the IMF entity, that was formed to replace the gold standard, is now trying to back the present paper gold with physical to prevent a run on the dollar. It is a futile effort as the ECB / BIS have grown the gold market into massive proportions by encouraging the many year expansion of holders through paper securities. All denominated, ultimately, in dollars. We will see $10,000 gold, count on it! It's the only way this can be resolved. That same figure will create massive backing for the Euro and hasten it's journey into world reserve currency status. Expect most of the ECB liability for gold to be easily converted into Euros at the dollars expense.

Now, the BOE action clearly shows the split between them and the IMF / Dollar faction. They have given up on freeing up IMF gold to support the dollar and are actively trying to help their LBMA. England will be forced into the EURO as they abandon ship. I expect an explosion in open interest on Comex as major players try to hedge themselves against short gold. The US now has no choice but to encourage gold to rise and use that action as a political ploy. They will no doubt try to gain much mileage out of the fact that the treasury has 8,000 tonnes of gold for dollar backing or outright sales. It will be a political discussion, only. As the gold market becomes more dynamic and gains media attention, many congressional investigations will target the short funds. After all, with gold killing the dollar, something must be done.

I have some other commits and replies to other posts. Be back in a minute.

Hello Richard,
First I want to say I'm sorry I posted 8:00MDT without a PM after the date. Not only that I am very late!

Your questions: " It would seem that your preference of precious metal ownership would be gold and in the form of bullion only. Correct?"
Yes, Richard. It should be viewed as an appreciating cash currency, not an investment.

"Any particular choice of one bullion coin or another? I've observed numismatic precious metal ownership is for more subjective than straight bullion. Do you agree?"
In a way, I agree. However, major investors do look at "numismatic" coins as an "Art Form" not unlike paintings. And, just as paintings were carried off by invading armies, rare coins will also hold their higher value during a currency war. Note: I didn't always feel this way. Another guided me into this style of thinking.

"I too see the news of recent days leading us to very "opportune buying moments in history", the likes of which we may not see again for a long time. Any further thoughts or things I may of missed?"

Hello again canamami,
Yes, many who invest in the gold "industry" are upset with this current state of affairs. However, investors that buy gold as a dollar replacement find this action much to their liking. For them gold is a currency that can not be purchased too cheaply. You see, it all depends how you view gold?

If gold goes to $1000 ,then the Euro would have reserves backed with 45-50% gold instead of 15%....right...?

Hello Chicken man,
No the Brits will not rescue the Euro, but the Euro may well rescue them from going down with the dollar! The BOE sale is but a small drop in the bucket, attempting a political statement that supports the LBMA with gold.
If I remember right, Another never thought that England would survive the currency change. It now looks like they will, at least, go down fighting!
Yes, the ECB system banks will be well backed with reserves, even if their dollar holdings crash! I expect they will be buying gold with dollars, in the open if the US congress does sell any IMF gold reserves.

THIS IS WAR

Hello St. George,
Good Idea! What really allowed this "master plan" of gold manipulation to work was investors putting their money into the gold industry, not physical gold. Far to many entities purchased paper gold in one form or another (most mutual funds included). This action became an accelerating
trend that the BIS acted upon. They played the gold market for their own purpose. In the process they did give many people an avenue of escape in physical gold. Let's face it, buying gold in the $380 to $280 range was and still is an incredible deal, considering it's history. Now, for reasons I have laid out in the past, any paper gold may have a problem of "perceived value". If the crisis is as bad as the BOE action indicates, the very world currency system will need real gold to survive.
Holders of "gold in the growing" will be fighting an accelerating public outcry for the government to do something! Know what I mean? FOA

E-Mail Question for Another and/or FOA from Steve
Michael,
I'm at work and don't have my password, but I don't want to forget these thoughts. The Saudi/Iran talks seem to have
vast implications, not only on possible oil prices, but with
regards to reliance on the US military. Could it be that
Saudi doesn't have the same faith in the US, could it be thata Saudi repudiation of the dollar might anger the US? An alliance with Iran would lessen the need for US military presence, thus opening the way for pricing oil in Euros or, perhaps, a basket of currencies, ie dollar/euro/yen.

Could you post this for opinions. I'd be interested to what
you, Another and FOA think.

Reply,
I think the political aspects of that sector of the world is evolving, and doing so in a way most analysts did not consider. Often, I would make a statement of possible alliance changes and would receive the typical "they would never do that because the US has the military for their
protection"! Well, does anyone ever consider that the US would defend that oil supply no matter what currency or price is used to purchase it. There is no possible political or strategic purpose to simply walk away from the middle east if Euros, gold or a basket of currencies were used to
price oil. To do otherwise, would allow the possible complete destruction of the oil fields, and that is a misplaced logic promoted by dollar advocates.

No, in time, oil will be revalued by it's true value for world commerce and that value will be denominated in the strongest currencies. Euros and gold!

FOA - 15% backing?

Goldfly,
Hello again. Truly the ECB percentage as a number does not mean much at this time. It's the concept that is 180 degrees against the IMF / dollar system. For anyone to measure the value of Euro backing at present, is like looking at gold at today's price. It's out of context.
The beauty of the ECB ploy, is that it doesn't lock them into a rigid gold exchange standard. With gold trading in the open, all currencies are free to be exchanged for gold at any given point in time. The old IMF / dollar manipulation of gold, used from the early 70s gained nothing and cost the world dearly for the benefit of the fictional US living standard it created. Had they just allowed gold to rise from the beginning, commerce would have been much more balanced, nation to nation.
Prior to the Euro, Europe had to play the IMF game. The same game that has now backfired on the US today. They truly don't need the IMF and may pull out later. FOA

FOA
I know well your thought on Gold stocks, do you hold the same opinion about stocks of USA oil producers?


el St.One,
That is a good question. I have thought about this for some time. Of all the world corporate citizens, oil companies will have the worst time of it. The 1970s oil shock was induced by the US taking the dollar off the gold standard. It had nothing to do with supply and demand or the world running out of oil. Plainly, it was a shock of "pricing" oil to allow for the depreciation of the
currency. Some said oil rose far to much to have represented the resulting depreciation. Nonsense! Oil was priced far to low, at the time, because it was expected that the dollar would honor gold conversion at $41+/- and then slowly depreciate by changing the rate to $500+ over time. A form of official, sliding devaluation against gold, while maintaining international convertibility. It was then, just as today, that the "expectation" of receiving gold at a bargain rate that allowed for cheap oil. When the dollar broke from gold, it's oil conversion rate (oil price) had
to make for "past lost value" first, then rise to equate "current value". Nothing has changed, as oil has come down over these past years because official gold was made liquid through a paper exchange. The only difference is that gold is off the official exchange standard and trades in an
open, highly liquid market, LBMA. No one has to set a rate, you just buy it. Of course, all of this is yesterdays news, as the entire system is in evolution.
What does this have to do with oil stocks? The second oil shock is coming, and this one will not be about the dollar going off the gold standard. The shock will arrive in the form of world oil no longer being traded in dollars as the major settlement. If you think nations will run to grab "gold in the ground" during a currency crisis, wait till we see how they grab "oil in the ground" during a
"REAL" oil crisis.

A country can operate without gold during a hyperinflation for some time, but they cannot even defend themselves without oil. Think about it? FOA

$10,000 gold
Michael and FOA,

Michael, Thank you for your quick response re: selling gold during/after US$/Euro currency switch. I've been following the recommendations and news in News & Views as well.

When FOA and Another were talking about $3000 and $6000 gold, I thought: "What a great potential for profit." But with the mention of $10,000 gold, I got a gut feeling that this kind of huge appreciation would have to be just too big a temptation to the US Government as a source of tax
revenue or confiscation.

I do remember FOA mentioning (10/10/98; 18:51:39MDT - Msg ID:494): "Physical gold purchase, contrary to most analysis, will be encouraged in America as an alternate form of wealth
(401-K or retirement savings) because it will redirect money from going into the Euro."

FOA, from the perspective of seven months later, do you still think that the US government will encourage private gold ownership as an alternate form of wealth to keep money from going into the Euro. Especially with gold going to such an astronomical price of $10,000? Or has something
happened to modify your viewpoint?

Thanks. BC

Hello BC,
My post of #494 is taken from Another's Thoughts of some time ago. I am forced to agree, in that there will be no other political strategy. Indeed, that concept must be looking across the "valley of doom" and observing life in a changed economic environment. History demonstrates the
precedent of gold often taking the drivers seat as "the asset class of choice" when paper money is destroyed. Most likely, the leaders are forced to go along because politicians cannot govern when no one will use their money! Yes, I am aware that many inflations find the citizens still using the hyper inflated currencies, long after it's value has become nothing. Many South American countries come to mind in their present state. But, that action is just the force of "legal tender laws" expending their last inertia energies.

As for $10,000 gold, does this sound strange? If it does you have probably been listening to the advocates of "gold the commodity". This group of educated investors usually "voice" their beliefs in an endearing, logical light that shines from the "pocketbook". How else can one view gold when all of their money is in the mining industry? As present events demonstrate, the use of gold as a currency subjects it to wide value swings, outside the it's most recent history. Truly, "gold the money" is bad business for industry investors. Gold's downside bankrupts them and it's
upside negates them to mining taxes for the state! BC, all present gold operations have bet on gold maintaining a stable value, ($500??) in the realm of it's commodity function. That is why they cannot and do not want to discuss gold in a currency mode. None of them are prepared for that
occurrence. However, history shows that gold is valued far higher as a currency medium than a jewelry item.
Please read my FOA (5/9/99; 15:40:38MDT - Msg ID:5814). There you will find the same relationship of oil to gold as we find gold to currencies today.
Gold does not presently register it's true value in terms of things. That is because it still valued as a "backup / insurance" currency against the world paper reserve system. Yes, most of the wealth holders, today would like to see the dollar system operate, as is. For them it still offers the best of all worlds. In that environment, three fourths of humanity work to service the one fourth.
Were gold allowed to trade in the open as a currency value regulator, it's benefit to the vast majority of working people would create a "human" premium. That premium would price gold out of it's "store it in the back room insurance" value and into it's historic place as "the asset that
represents my life's work and dreams". A premium that says, "My families efforts are worth more than a paper account in the bank that is lent out for the use of entities I do not know"!
Yes, BC, the change from this present system of debtors will bring $10,000 gold, at the least.

Aragorn III,
The BOE does want to help the LBMA to some extent. Politically the Central Bank must attempt to support them, after all look at who the Bullion banks are! I think it would be understood between these entities, that if England does run for the Euro at the expense of the dollar, these gold merchants are dead in the water. Yes, political favors will require BOE to offer gold, even if it is a drop in the bucket, but as a soldier will fire his last round in a lost battle, so will "The Bank" ship it's last ounce of gold. This is serious stuff and the Friday news shows just where
they are going.

True, the merchants are only the middle man in this "war of giants", but the US and it's dollar also need this market to function if they are to keep the paper gold longs from "wholesale" jumping ship also. Right now the big longs are balanced, if they lose contract delivery from a failing LBMA, it's made up in a soaring oil and gold price held through secure ECB commitments. They "called the tune" a long time ago when big money started supporting paper gold in dollar settlement. The gold market is now locked and has but to react to the shortage of physical gold priced in dollars. As we run out of major CBs that offer to unload gold, so does the dollar run out of time. The BOE may have been the last?

However, this ship is going to sink slowly if for no other reason than the IMF / dollar factions are still trying to save it. In this environment, investors (TYoung?) need patience and an un-leveraged position as this major act unfolds.

Christine,
Thank you for reading and thinking out loud. This forum would be blank if we all saw the world through the same camera. No offense taken.

By your numbers:
1. It does appear that the Saudi's may be re-aligning with Iran for defense, and moving away from the US. This would support a Middle-East re-alignment with the euro.
2. The price of oil was held down for 2 1/2 years, doing much damage to the US oil industry, and reducing our ability to respond to oil cartel pressures on price or supply. Also, with all the refinery fires, I feel that a US gasoline shortage is being currently set up. The US power structure appears to be orchestrating this component of what is unfolding. ie. US gasoline price hikes and potential shortages now unfolding appear to be orchestrated from the inside, not by the euro/BIS or the Middle East.
3. It appears that US/IMF/BIS/Euroland are all complicit together at the moment in holding the euro down and the US dollar up so as to make their currency exchanges from dollar to euro at best rates.
4. As far as I know, Euroland is a block of countries without much natural energy or gold in the ground.
5. The countries not in Euroland have a wealth of energy and gold in the ground.
6. I do agree it is logical that some oil nations are unhappy with US dollars and have insisted upon a gold payment, and this is a factor in what is going on.

1. Agree!

2. Partial agreement. At first, the falling oil prices (over many years during the 90s) was a shared goal by all. This included the US, Europe and most of the dollar world. I don't think the powers that drove this think like James Bond, but it could have been a dollar trap from the beginning. That is the current perception. Yes, the long effect was to damage the viability of the local US oil
industry, but again, they didn't intend to drive gold (and therefore oil) that low in the beginning. It was only after the dollar was trapped by paper gold that it needed ever lower physical prices to keep a chain reaction from spiking gold. This in turn drove the dollar higher in world markets
creating the asset bubble in America today. True, I do think the US players are sending out "readings" to the public to get them ready for higher oil prices and the price inflation that will create. However, they are being pushed in this direction by the reality of a changing dollar reserve system. The same reality created by the Euro
faction. NO, the refinery fires are a sad loss of accidental consequence.

3. Disagree! Recent history will dictate the animosity between the BIS and the US! Please don't take my word for it. Mr. Mosel (kitco) is well educated on this, ask him? Or, read up some of the 1960 / early 1970s money wars that were fought. Old bankers never forget!

4. True, and they have outlived America for how long? Great nations are made from great people, not resources. The US did not get where it's at because it had gold. Gold was delivered to this country (far more than was mined) to buy it's economic productivity.

5. Same answer.

6. Yes.

As Mr. Another would say " We watch this new gold market together, Yes?"! Christine, more will come to light and prove us not right or wrong, but observant.

Back on (FOA (4/30/99; 22:33:18MDT - Msg ID:5420) I offered this:
"I am watching Comex gold trading now, because this should be the place where local (US based) funds attempt to reduce their exposure to any future rise in gold (perceived or otherwise)."
In that post and several others, prior, it was shown how and why major short hedge funds would cover their positions from political scrutiny. They are doing this, but, as yet, not by going long "actual comex" contracts. The action is taking place in the "Comex Options" market. This
area is usually used by gamblers that bet on gold. Few, if any of these players actually take delivery of the "comex gold future's". Now, a different operator (s) is buying in, the above mentioned Funds. These people have the "real" short exposure necessary to hedge long, buy taking delivery of the contracts.

As stated before, over the coming months, expect the "comex futures OI" to expand tremendously as long positions are taken "outright" or established from exercising "gold futures options". This "play" has begun on the world OTC gold market, often used by LBMA traders. The amount of gold offered by the BOE sales will be a "drop in the bucket", it is creating an avenue for hedging (perhaps it's real intent?). Local investors cannot watch the OTC figures, but
that trading is spilling over into the "comex gold options floor".

This recent fall in price was but a "trading range move" to allow for an "ongoing" repriceing of gold. They will not dare to keep it below $280 for long. A warning shot may be fired by the BIS controlled ECB this week! We shall see! FOA

Hello Cavan Man'
I agree with your assessment. Also, I add, that stocks, bonds, currencies, real estate and "water use" are all manipulated daily! It is a built in component of the "Western" 'Politically Free" society! The only time people become outraged at this "obviously unmoral" practice, is when it effects a large vocal group "negatively in their pocketbook". I don't see gold stock owners suing the
Federal reserve board because the dollar is "too strong"! Yet, millions of third world citizens are impoverished by this move. Most novice investors accept the notion that the currencies are "priced and balanced" fairly by market forces.

I, personally, think they were for a while. After all, the Euro group will, just as the US group, take all the power they can get! But, world power struggles are always a funny thing, in that no one entity is as great at maneuvering politics as they think they are. Each group has it's own strengths the other cannot counter.
Look at Russia, a full blown nuclear power that rivaled the US, yet, all of that military might went out the door when the "money war" broke them! Then there is Japan? One of the biggest economic, financial powers in the world, and they went bust for lack of "political agreement"!
China has none (relatively) of the above, yet they are the major desire of the US and Europe for all of their ability to produce economically. And they play that card with incredible ability.
However, all of it pales in comparison to oil. If they did suspect that the BIS was playing them into a "new World Order" then that explains their use of the "gold card". It was allowed to be known that the failure of the Euro to replace the dollar would bring on the reprice of oil using
partial payment of a tiny fractional gold amounts per barrel in the settlement mix. Real gold, not paper! It would have forced every oil producer in the world to follow as the gold price would have blew past $30,000 as the new oil currency. Quickly, at the last minute, the ECB and the BIS announced that Euro system Central Banks would stop all selling and wind down leasing. Then gold was brought into the reserve mix for the Euro. Perhaps a counter play? You bet!

The game goes on. FOA

Gandalf and All,
I want to expand (or repeat) about the Open Interest Posts. First, I quoted from the wrong post. It should have been #5418 as it gives a better background. Here is part of it:

"""""FOA (4/30/99; 21:59:59MDT - Msg ID:5418)
I am watching Comex gold trading now, because this should be the place where local (US based) funds attempt to reduce their exposure to any future rise in gold (perceived or other wise).

Private investment funds, that have raised capitol through any form of gold short securities, may be asked to expose their "risk". The full group of investment entities may also be expanded to include "any" other parties that have dealings or actual exposure to these funds that are short. In essence, every major player in the gold market could be looking for a way to "neutralize" their books to scrutiny. Even though your exposure may have come from the unregulated part of the OTC world gold market, if one is "hedged long" on a "politically acceptable" exchange, then your position is "politically not at risk"! The books stay closed.

So why watch Comex, open interest? If a certain political faction suddenly changed direction and wanted to revalue gold as an asset to lend money against, the fasted way to do it is to drive currency traders into the paper gold traded on comex. When looked at in this light, gold takes on
a very different appearance than the commodity we thought it was.""""

I went on to talk about volume. The point of this post and my one earlier #5905 was to prepare a background for the coming major trading that will take place on Comex. It will not be about trying to take delivery of comex gold, rather to match paper longs against "uncoverable" paper shorts". As the gold market becomes more dynamic and media attention increases, most major traders that are short will need coverage on their "books" not actual delivery. In a way,
what I said above.

Peter, a few dollars out of line will be nothing compared to the financial and political liability about to be heaped upon the world "gold shorts". As I told Gandalf, it is already spilling over out of the OTC trading and showing up on the gold options open interest. Small as it is at 400,000+, it will grow until that arena becomes frozen from use (read that the premiums will explode)! Then
the real Comex OI will start growing. They will exercise some options for future contracts, if only to roll them (Futures contracts) over to further out delivery.

BC, hello! There is most certainly a correlation between the BOE sales and the expiration of comex futures. It points to the whole reason for the BOE sales in the first place. An announcement that this is the end of the game! They are going to take out as much of the "most favored" Bullion merchants as possible and let the rest burn.
I know that Michael (USAGOLD) does not think that England will go for the Euro, but some line has been crossed. The US is now about to drive gold UP! Please read this partial post:

---------------FOA (4/30/99; 22:33:18MDT - Msg ID:5420)

Michael,
Hello again! I'll reprint the item you committed on:

"This points to the odd circumstances that require America to free up gold through the IMF so they can benefit. Whereas, the ECB has but to only let the price rise!"

When one puts on a political thinking cap, that statement does say a lot! Why else would the ECB establish a precedent of routinely "marking to the market" their gold (and the gold of the Euro System banks also). Then add to that your remark of:

"becomes clear that this is a very risky business and that they are being asked to sacrifice their gold to defend another country's currency."

Suddenly, we see who's gold was really at risk, all along! Are we in the last days of the dollar, as the US agrees to politically drive gold higher to benefit the IMF? And by extention, world dollar reserves as expressed in dollar debt! Will the US be forced to drive it's own dollar down against gold in an attempt to save it's reserve status? Dynamic times, indeed! FOA-----------


As opposite as it seems, the BOE is selling gold to soften the dollar exit for their members, not to bring their gold ratio in line for entry! They are spliting fron the US because the gold / dollar game is lost. Now from #5699:

-----------The "dollar reserve system" is truly in trouble.
With the IMF gold sales in doubt, or delayed. And the EURO / BIS factions blocking any new gold. New gold cannot be found to maintain the backing of collateral for existing paper shorts and the massive liquidity they provide. The UK is directly in the middle of this as the LBMA would all
but "disappear" if world dollar liquidity were to shrink from a higher gold price!

Notice what the Bank Of England said: "It also said that eligible bidders will be limited to members of the London Bullion Market Association and central banks and monetary institutions holding gold accounts with the Bank of England." Truly, the IMF / Dollar faction alliance is
failing, with each now about to support it's own entities! The BOE will most definitely back the LBMA first and foremost with fresh collateral!---------------------

Hello PH,
Thanks for your consideration.

I'll start with one very important statement, "the gold market is cornered"! When one reads your Clarification post it becomes evident that the "gold card" was never played. Or was it?

During the last number of years, possibly most of the 90s, the gold market was expanded tremendously. The result was that the holders of "paper gold" and "physical gold", as a group, now own more gold than exists! Is no wonder that the "technical analysis" and "supply / demand" "investment managers" are in a shambles to explain the workings of this new market. Truly, as said before, they are commodity analysis, not political currency analysis. For them, a cornered market must be soaring to reflect the imbalance of longs and shorts. Now can one understand that gold, the political money, is managed on a world scale for the purpose of control of currencies.

From the beginning, the BIS knew that if gold ownership was spread far and wide by leasing from a few European banks, one day, gold would control the value of the dollar. Today, the major longs, that are the recipients of all of that expanded gold, now control the bullion banks, and quite possibly, the CBs. All of this through the threat of delivery that the act of playing the "oil gold card" would "demand"!

Is it then, any wonder, that the quite, cool, suffering longs, watch as the Swiss, the IMF the BOE, all struggle to sell gold in an effort to only "maintain" the credibility of the shorts? All done in a desperate act to save the IMF and by design, the dollar! In this light, was there really a problem if gold falls?

A fine gentleman I know has said, "the Euro, it be a success, for I do see it written in the wind"

Gold!
Hello Everyone,
There are so many posters now, I no longer have the ability to reply / comment using each name. Because of my circumstance, I must read several days writings and then post! It is still very interesting to grasp the minds of so many thinkers. A true joy.

How many times have we seen this comment: "If gold went to $10,000 or $30,000 do you know what the price of hamburgers would be?" That is a good observation, but still, one taken out of context. I ask, what is the point of his statement? Does it say that it is no use to own gold if
common items are priced so high as to make the holding of gold a neutral action?

Usually, these side remarks are made with a "currency frame of mind". In other words, the person fully expects the present financial / currency system to continue to function for the duration and plans to profit from any ongoing crisis. The catch word is "profit", because this investor will "trade" the gold market, using leverage to multiply his currency holdings as the profit. Again, that mind holds that their is nothing to gain, if physical gold only maintains the loss of purchasing power during an inflation. It is at this juncture that I differ from most gold investors!

But first, a few questions / statements of mine to counter: " If hamburgers went to $100 each, for god sake, what would the price of gold be?". Or: If hyperinflation was 50%, and foreign exchange controls blocked me from buying other currencies, how would anyone possibly "afford" gold?" Or: "Gasoline just went up $.50 a gallon last month, now it's $8.00. My salary has not kept pace with this inflation, because it only doubled last year to $215,000. After taxes, I'm behind and now my broker says I should buy some gold at $6,346.00 an ounce. It's up a thousand in six months, totally unaffordable for me, an "average utility worker"!!" Or: "There is talk of rationing and bank withdrawals on a percentage basis, how can my neighbor still buy gold
with what is available, what a fool"!

The above train of thought paints a strange picture of a currency going bad, along with the human perception of that event. It is under these circumstances that our original "hamburger man" thinks he will "outsmart" the brightest paper traders on wall street. He will not have a chance! Not
to mention, he doesn't even think the system will fail in this manner. Perhaps, everyone will be getting killed while he outmaneuvers the government's new laws and regulations! Yes, they may try to seize gold and / or tax it's transactions. Or they may encourage it's use as an asset saving account However, these actions will be the "Result" of gold soaring in price, not because it's returning to $40 an ounce! Yes, the very regulatory actions most analysts exclaim as reasons not to invest in gold are truly the result of a world trying to grasp the yellow metal.

Search your own feelings and consider, If our "burger man" "REALLY" understood that physical gold could go into the thousands, would he not be buying it with both hands, regardless of any government action or price inflation offset. Killer investor traders do not walk away from
real things with a huge price dynamic on the horizon, they buy and hold forever, if necessary. But, only if they "believe in" the "dynamic" and the "real wealth payoff".

One of the strangest comments Another ever made was something to the effect of "gold is falling because so many people are buying it"! Some of you, no doubt remember it. What a ridiculous statement to consider,,,, if you are a "burger man" (or woman). He made this point some time ago without explaining clearly. Today, if you have read some of my other posts, it is becoming clear!
Truly, the reason people think gold is being manipulated in a conspiracy, is because it's price is falling while it's ownership is expanding. Usual supply and demand factors don't allow markets to react that way. "Burger people" resent this because it cuts them off from participating in this market, on the long side, using their favorite vehicle, paper leverage. They do not use leverage to short because the fundamentals say it should be going up. Indeed, today, the more the world gold market is expanded, the lower it's price. Yes, the only way to walk in these footsteps, is to buy physical gold.

The buying is not conspiratorial, and has been evident for some time. We have but to look at the massive volume on LBMA to see it. That is a fact, not something hidden away. A gentleman named "Big Trader" pointed out some time ago, that the buying would start as soon as gold fell below $360! It did and it did! Right after that, LBMA had to start announcing it's volume because it became so large. Most of you remember that day. Also, the fact that many brokers (GS) and bullion banks now guarantee the delivery of this massive new area of gold ownership (they are short), does not mean they are shrewd or smart. Or that they are "controlling" the market, it just means they are selling lower and lower. Nor does it mean that they are "profiting" from these
transactions as, to date, most of them are marked to the market, not completed or closed. Yes, some of them are concluded, but, you know and I know that these are but a tiny percentage of outstanding transactions.

If all of the "burger people" truly believe that the gold market is this short, then common reason must dictate that "the someone" is massively long?? An open fact for all to see. It is not hidden! Again, the problem with this state of affairs arises because gold is being massively brought at
lower prices, and expanding it's ownership, all the while, leverage players cannot make a dime from it! Manipulation?? NO!! Investment, done in the open by savvy, smart investors? You bet!

Now, why would major entities buy physical or buy the "short paper" of gold in a world of falling prices? It makes no sense to "burger people" because they expect gold to return to it's natural "commodity value" of say $500/ oz with the world financial system in tact. Just as soon as
the manipulation stops, that is.

My friends, what we are witnessing here is history in the making. Western investors, analysts and gold fund managers are asleep, holding gold industry securities with loses. They are waiting for "gold the commodity" to return to it's "deemed correct price", while major world entities are planning for the end of the dollar as a reserve asset. While local economist use the recent twenty eight years as a "precedent" to price gold in dollars, others use the "total history of currency failure" as the reason to buy real gold at ever lower prices. European lending of gold started as an
"inducement" for one oil producer to lower the price of oil and expand the use and value of a failing dollar. This began in earnest in the early 90s as a straight forward way to "buy" cheap oil. Then it expanded into a method of selling gold to anyone that wanted to trade dollars for it "And
Not Gun The Price"! It is painfully obvious for anyone to see, if they look closely. Gold was frozen from use when the IMF was formed and subjected the BIS into a locked dollar world. The late 1980s clearly demonstrated that no one would be allowed to exchange dollars for gold at a reasonable price. The world would use the dollar or the entire financial system would fall. Today, by effectively returning gold to currency status through multiple "gold carry" transactions, under the guise of mine forward sales and lending, the BIS has created a reserve asset base. A base that competes directly with the dollar and benefits the Euro when the dollar is "unreserved".

"Burger People" will and do find this offensive, mostly because they are not positioned for this event, nor do they believe this is happening. Events will prove that the next rise in the dollar price of gold will be from the beginning of a complete meltdown in the IMF / dollar asset world. That
rise, will most certainly not represent the "commodity value of gold", however, it will represent the "commodity value of the dollar"!

Now my friends, you know why I stand entirely in the center of the "footsteps of giants" and by reason, "what gold means to me".


Thank You FOA

@Christine msg 6176-Subject $10,000 GOLD!
GOLD IS NICE!
From msg.6176: If price of Gold went to $10,000 as FOA suggests would it not become virtually out of reach of most citizens?

Since a question was asked,here is my humble personal response.
Up until the late 1970's I always felt physical ownership of Gold was for very wealthy people only,Kings, Queens,Governments Central Banks etc.

In the 1959 or there abouts time period when Gold was fixed(in the U.S.)at $35 per ounce,I was in the military,they had the draft in those days.Take home pay for me was $80 dollars per MONTH,I also got $8 dollars overseas pay. Even if Gold ownership in the U.S. was legal in those days I didn't make enough after bills to own any.
Things have changed,in the world, and in my personal financial situation.
Private ownership of Gold coins is encouraged by most,if not all,countries of the world.
Lets examine $10,000 per ounce price of Gold with current choice of coins:
1 ounce pure Gold coin-cost $10,000 plus premium.
1/2 ounce pure Gold coin-cost $5,000 plus premium.
1/4 ounce pure Gold coin-cost $2,500 plus premium.
1/10 ounce pure Gold coin-cost $1,000 plus premium.
1/20 ounce pure Gold coin-cost $500 plus premium.

If Gold goes to $10,000 per ounce, coins with more alloy and less Gold(although it would be pure Gold.)would probably be minted.Gold is also measured in grams and grains:
1 troy ounce=31.103 grams.
1 troy ounce=480 grains.
So if my math is correct:
1/20 of an ounce=1.55515 grams or 24 grains.So lets make a coin using grains of Gold.
A coin with 2.4 grains of Gold(with Gold at $10,000)would be worth-$50 dollars plus premium.
A coin containing .24 grains(a little less than 1/4 grain)would cost(with Gold at $10,000) get this--$5 DOLLARS plus premium.To make another comparison:
Gold is about $280 dollars per ounce right now The *#*~^@* Bank of England just announced possible sale of 400 ounce bars of Gold they would cost $112,000 per bar at current prices.How many reading this are buying bars this size?FWIW........beesting

Comment on earlier discussion!
Barrick - hedges

One of the first signs that a new gold market was being created was when bullion banks were allowed to sell Central Bank gold "ownership invoices", for cash to the benefit of Barrick. The CBs got only a very small rate of return for this risk. The money set in a bank account and interest
was made. The new owners of the gold paid cash but let the gold set in the CB vault. All that happened was that Barrick could earn interest on it's unmined reserves and call it "the higher price they were getting for gold"! In addition, the CBs said they could roll it forward for ten years +/-,
if the price of gold rose!
Really clear eyes could see that the CBs were paying mines interest on unmined reserves if they would replace the CB real gold with mine collateral. Because the gold didn't really leave the vault, the new securities were used to match the mine future assets against the new owners of the gold!

Neat trick. After the public bought it as "the CBs earning interest on a nonpaying asset", the gates were opened. It wasn't long before gold was lent without any gold at all! No different than "fractional reserve" banking. The mines were (are) being used to expand the gold trading arena
and they don't even know what is happening. Now, as the price has fallen, all mines must earn interest on reserves, just to survive. The dollar bears are, in effect, nationalizing the mines gold reserves at ever lower prices. Tell me the CBs are dumb? ??

Hello canamami,

------------ "If "yes", will this disestablishment pertain to the $US solely as an international reserve currency, or also as the domestic US currency, leading to the introduction of a new American currency even for domestic transactions and savings?"--------------

If the reserve function of the dollar is degraded, that action will most certainly affect it's internal trading value. Inflation will rule the day as the local (internal) money is locked within it's borders with "foreign exchange controls"! Most external dollars exist in the form of interest bearing securities (US debt) and they will be handled just as the Russian debt is. No one will declare it
worthless. It will still trade on foreign markets at a discount.

-------------"Do you anticipate "Weimar Republic"-type hyperinflation? What are your time frames?----------

It has to! There is no practical use for the excess amounts or valuations of a reserve currency that has been replaced (unreserved). As I said several weeks ago, the change is starting. Yes the price of gold has fallen, but still within it's framework. Someone, here asked if the BIS would still buy in the open below $280? I think they will to protect the scale of the market. However, if the US is now actively, about to gun gold, the BIS may wait a bit. Also, If Bill Murphy of GATTA (??) really wants to get action, they should go to Switzerland and present a public appeal to the BIS. That could be all they need for a "precedent", especially if it coincides with a new US policy push!

----------An interesting tidbit. There is a program called "Cities at War" on a Canadian cable network called the History Channel. In the episode on Berlin, the narrator stated that the restaurants which had anything left to sell continued to do a brisk business, even with the Russians
within 35 miles. Can you imagine: Some restaurant owner hustling like crazy amid the destruction and mayhem of March 1945, for payment in Nazi Currency! I think payment in gold would have been a much better bet!!!-------

Good point! Add to that the present day action of citizens still using currencies like the Mexican Peso and we see how old habits lead to wealth destruction. FOA

@FOA--It is unlikely that Barrick Gold is some passive foil of the BIS in this currency change. With board of directors like George Bush and Brian Mulrooney, Barrick has been a key tool manipulated by US. Cover your ears, conspiracy dislikers, but my guess is that at some point as gold soars, the US will come out with a new gold-linked currency similar to the euro. Still keep you ears covered--I also suspect that Britain is lowering the pound value to join the dollar, not the euro.

Christine,
Why would anyone conclude that Barrick was a "passive foil" of the BIS? At the time, they made a smart, innovative move that allowed them to earn interest in unmined reserves. Why would they want to be part of a grand expansion of gold ownership that drives gold lower to achieve that end? These people are miners, not goldbugs. The bottom line is all that counts, no matter who is on the board of directors. Gandalf the White is correct, in that the big names are on the "international" Advisory Board. That position is used to open locked doors for new projects, not plan strategy to counter declines in gold prices.

Barrick is only interested in the broad ownership of gold if it increases it's price. Had they understood the process, as you point out that they must have, leasing gold would never been part of the plan. They didn't need to, for their mines operate at a very low cost. The stock price fell, anyway, so what good did the return do for the shareholders? The precarious position of their portfolio, along with it's risk is now well understood! They, like everyone else, planed for gold to fluctuate in a range of "appropriate commodity value" and saw an opportunity to earn interest on ore reserves during what was perceived as a "lower price period". We are out of that range now and on the verge of blasting through to the other limit.

What of their exposure? It was never done before on this scale, but that is only because the CBs never had a reason to lend gold for almost zero return. I am taken by the naivety of the public and the boards of these companies. It shows the extent that greed holds when no one asked why the CBs were suddenly giving away gold to lend. Remember that interest rates were much higher when all of this lending started. That comparison makes the return discrepancy even
more obvious.

As far as your new gold backed currency for the US? Just how do you expect it to trade along side it's current unbacked unit? As much as the world has power struggles, there are "rules of engagement" that every must deploy under. For the US to issue a new currency, the old one
would have become completely worthless! NO? Comments?

Thanks for the details. We should all learn about gold through Chinese eyes. They will be major players in the Euro transition.

FOA....I take the bet, my good friend. Do I get odds? I've got another one for you, FOA. I think that Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown may have exposed the British pound to a speculative attack much like what Malaysia experienced a few years ago. The Asian contagion in Britain? Too far out to comtemplate? Maybe not. Remember Soros.

Hello USAGOLD,
No odds in this major bet! Seriously, the odds of this event will be exposed in a possible lifestyle change in the US. As Christine would say, "they are much too smart not to have known the outcome". I think Mr. Brown has placed the pound "in play" and that course of action will culminate with the British public reaching for the Euro! Politics requires the voters to voice a popular opinion, before action is taken. A pound, severed from the dollar union will crash resistance to a currency change. I believe oil money has been pulling out of London for over a year, now! The game continues!

@FOA--I propose another wager
How about Britain will be joining up with US in new US gold-linked currency. Do you know who has been buying all the gold at firesale prices these last few years. You have wisely pointed out that with all the selling, there has to be buyers.

Canamami,
Most of the recent history of the world was written to record the human struggles for power and dominance. These efforts were compensated for, using the value inherent in real money, gold. Practically all of the activity in our past stands as the proof that "gold" represents the goals and aspirations of mankind.
The difference between "conspiracy" and "strategy" blur in the context of "the lust and greed to control political events" and "right planning for the nations future"! Only a sharp mind can separate the two and understand their implications. Often, a group of minds, as we have here, can find the truth.
Please continue.

Christine,
Your position holds that the world is coming together. The "power leaders" are working together to create a "one world" "all controlling" currency /economic system. If true, your thinking will rewrite history as the actions of the past are not supportive in this aspect.

Nowhere in the recorded history of mankind have world leaders "colluded" successfully without opposition!. Always, our earth has been broken into power groups that have fought each other. You will find on agreement from scholars, that our "human nature" supports the actions you present.

What you ascribe to would represent a true international "conspiracy" of a strange nature, as the political elements would all be on the same side of the "gold position". They would "in effect" be buying gold from themselves. Nor do capitol flows indicate the US as the buyer. The vast pool
of dollars that support the purchase of gold, all reside outside that country. Indeed, the very concept of linking gold to the dollar, by the US would hasten it's demise under the current reserve system. You will have to resolve that conflict of political wills, for your thoughts to be
constructive. Also, you stated that the US could issue a new currency in the same format as the Euro. Again, you will have to resolve the debt / international currency reserve issue, residing with the dollar that is not present with the Euro.

Please do address these in depth, we look forward to your thoughts.

A Troubling and Perhaps Insane Theory

Canamami,
Perhaps, the English definition of "conspiracy" will have to be rewritten! It is now often applied "out of context" as the definition of natural political maneuvers. I ask you, how can a country plan it's direction without establishing a protocol for responses to international assaults? Be they attracts of physical nature or economic in form. The average citizen goes about their affairs and
views these actions as "highly controversial", yet given the same set of attacks in private life, they would peruse the same course of action. We are governments of "organic" people with common wants , desires and responses not "machine like"!

Would the USA attempt to control events in the Middle East? Of course. The record shows this as an ongoing operation for many, many years. Why would it change now if oil was repriced to the degradation of American economic strength. Myself, and most of Washington would not label this "conspiracy" or even "theory", as it would be a just counter play on the world arena. It is a "given" and "accepted" action, not a "contemplation" of shadow groups. The question to be explored is: "What would the response be and how would it effect the flow of oil"?

I have a reply to this, does anyone else? FOA

Discussion
Christine,
Before we pursue this discussion further, I would ask you to please define your use of the word "conspiracies"? Because this forum is read by hundreds (or thousands) of lurkers, in all fairness, that term must be put in "context" as it's use is applied by the author. Your understanding of the term could be different from others. As an example, PHinLA offered a partial view of his "context", even though it was only a small application of his broad views.
(thanks PH)
Msg ID:6317)
"As far as the topic of the "conspiratorial nature of international power plays" is concerned, I would suggest that such labels tend to betray a shallow understanding of human endeavor on the part of the commentator. It is all too easy to dream up conspiracies based on what COULD happen without regard for what actually IS happening (either behind or in front of the scene). Such thoughts usually fall more easily into the realm of entertainment than into that of
understanding: Imagination unfettered by reality onstraints; certainly a valuable commodity in today's Hollywood-influenced mental processes, but hardly the way things work in the "real" world."

You have often referred to my views as if I was offering them in a "conspirator" format. I respectfully submit that , I do not offer them as such. At least in my definition of the term. As examples of your writing:

Msg ID:6331 " I do not think FOA has spent innumerable hours here and elsewhere posting of economic upheavals coming for no reason. However, all interpretations nvolvingconspiracies must be questioned and challenged, and none accepted on blind faith. "

Msg ID:6320 "Do you not think FOA is proposing a conspiracy for his view of why things are the way they are?"

There are many more. Therefore, as public discussion always demands, please define how you view my writing in your "conspiracy context", so as to allow me to agree or reject your conclusions. This is, of course, for the benefit of others understanding. Thank You FOA

Comment
All:
I thank everyone for offering their conclusions to "A Troubling and Perhaps Insane Theory #6294".

The duscussion that followed this post offered a great example of "making ones point". Often thinkers discuss topics by stating what they think, without adding "why they think it". The "why" is always the most interesting part and the one that others learn from or challenge using respect.

In the world of international politics observers and analyst must often draw conclusions from historical precedent, natural human tendencies and sometimes just "feelings". Many times, just the "sequence of events" can create "a chain of thought" that leads to a "logical" conclusion. As much as the world investment community demands "facts" before investing, it is rare, indeed if that
luxury is offered. I submit that many generals have won wars using little more than "anticipated human reaction" to create a battlefield strategy.

Mr. canamami, in your excellent piece it was stated "Invade" can include a sponsored coup to set up a compliant regime". I do agree and believe that such an action may even be on the books. It is most certainly consistent with past / present US actions. Would it be accepted in today's
world? Let's see.

Whenever I read of a new US adventure, I always get the "feeling" that they are "fighting the devil" as you have stated. You continue with examples from the " Spanish-American War" on into the present. In each instance, America accomplished more good than harm. Standing in the
context of each event, using "sequence of events" for logic, most would agree that each conflict would have degenerated had the US not intervened.

Further, you use the term "US Elite" as the driving force behind an active "forcible seizure" (as Ann Ryan details it). I ask, why not the "public" as the driving force? Would a need to control oil not originate from citizens, caught in an economic turmoil? This would be a real event, brought on by a newly uncompetitive industrial base. A manufactured event would prove unnecessary as
every unemployed worker would know who the "devil" was.

I bring this up because in many instances, there is always a "background presence" in American thought. That being, "if the driving force behind our economy (oil) becomes so expensive, our leaders (elite?) would initiate the seizure of the oil fields". Do you see the conflict I observe?
Always, the corrupt power broker elite will do the job, yet, in the minds of the people, they demand a response!

While the use of a cause, Susan B. Anthony feminism, human rights or Christianity v. Islam could work, I question if it would be necessary, this time. Your point, " The American people won't support a war for such mercenary purposes" is well taken, in the context of the present
economy! But, would that view hold in the different economic world that would exist at that time?

Let's continue:

canamami asks, "Can the world continue to bank on US virtue?" And Cavan Man (6298) replies:
"do you mean all of us in the collective or are you referring to the government? If you are referring to the collective than you are implying that there are more virtuous citizens than not. In that case I hope you are right. If you are referring to the government than I submit that "US virtue" in that context is an oxymoron."

Mr. Cavan Man, thank You! My observation is that your statement does, indeed reflect the current US economy more so than actual held beliefs! I also extend my "hope" for the virtuous citizen when the times change. Perhaps, the government will be the moderating force in the future?

I offered my thoughts in: FOA 6314: "I ask you, how can a country planit's direction without establishing a protocol for responses to international assaults? Be they attacks of physical nature or economic in form. The average citizen goes about their affairs and views these actions as "highly controversial", yet given the same set of attacks in private life, they would peruse the same course of action. We are governments of "organic" people with common wants , desires and responses not "machine like"!"

Again, we view our leaders as "controlling elite" during the fat years, yet all of us hold the same human values in times of stress. That being, "not only protect what is ours, but grasp what is our given right to control"! The given prosperity of oil, of course.

In #6303, canamami states, "As great powers go, the US is positively saintly, at least most of the time." I add that saintly actions will be a "steep hill to climb" if the US dollar is threatened in a fashion that generated the German inflation leading up to the World war.

In PHinLA #6317, he writes,
"Such a military adventure would negate every historical trend in international politics of the 20th-century. The US does not pursue such naked political and military adventures; it prefers more subtle measures such as the cultivation and maintenance of a reserve currency to bring
about the desired results."

That, my friend is a very true fact! It is also the very "chain of thought" that leads me to ask: will the trend in politics be negated by the loss of a "reserve currency"?
PH, I should just print your entire article, as it says much about western concepts. Here is more:
"Any contemplation of such a military course of action, even if it were labeled a civil rights campaign in favor of women's liberation (a concept I doubt could be seriously entertained by any sane and/or thinking person in 20th-century America) would imply so many philosophical changes in US policy that the natural evolution of this idea would change the world as we know it beyond recognition. It would bring about enormous and radical changes in the global balances of power it would seek to prevent; an obvious contradiction! The flow of oil and today's economic system
would be vastly and unrecognizably different."

The next paragraph in your post was (I believe) directed towards another discussion about "conspiratorial nature of international power plays" and did not apply (completely) to this subject.

And this fabulous discussion continues with:

canamami 6367:
"I submit the main change in the international order is the abandonment of the theory that what goes on within a country is that country's sole business (let's call it the "Westphalia principle"), replaced by the new notion that the international community can intervene to protect "human
rights". The current actions of NATO (unapproved by the UN) in Kosovo are conducted in the name of "human rights", to prevent ethnic cleansing. When the Soviets "cleansed" eastern Europe of ethnic Germans, when India and Pakistan religiously cleansed themselves, when the Turks cleansed eastern Cyprus of Greek-Cypriots, where was the international intervention in the name of "human rights". I submit that something new now exists - countries will now go to war in the name of "human rights".

And he add the question of: "The problem is: what are "human rights"?

I would add that this answer will be in context in the future, to repeat myself, "the human right to a sound reserve currency and a stable economy brought about by cheap oil"!

Mr. PH writes again in 6373,
"No, it is one thing to topple a dictator here or there in a marginal country with little clout. It is quite another to take on a behemoth like China or Saudi Arabia. I take the liberty of putting those two countries in the same category because an attack on the Saudis would be taken as one on all
countries in the region by local inhabitants."

PH, I think the recent move by Arabia to bind with Iran is telling in that they may have read our minds. However, their conclusions were directed towards a future era. Not the present atmosphere that produced this excellent discussion. With the US unable to complete it's goals in
Iraq and now other parts of the world, a charge into the oil fields brought on by the repricing of oil would be a disaster. The precedent (and soon the troops) are now in place. All that would be required to triger an event, is an incident, financial and far reaching in nature. When, as
USAGOLD #6386 noted, "Britain's Tony Blair is about to step up pressure on the Clinton administration to use "American" ground troops in the Balkans." it becomes evident that the
financial system is at risk today, more than ever in history. And the only currency that can survive "risk" will move to the forefront of attention. I believe that in the future, this discussion will take the lead in world media, if no other reason than "this cannot be happening"!

"Britain and Iran Move to Restore Full Ties"
Compiled by Our Staff From Dispatches
LONDON - Britain and Iran, whose relations plummeted 10 years ago after Tehran issued an Islamic death edict against the writer Salman Rushdie, announced Tuesday that they had agreed to restore diplomatic relations to the level of ambassador.

Britain was the only European Union country without an ambassador in Tehran.

''This step marks the end of years of dispute,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said. ''It fulfills the agreement we secured with the Iranian government in New York in September 1998.''

@FOA--Timing of oil rise
------"It appears that every manipulation possible is being done right now to hold the price of gold down, the dollar up, and the euro down."------- I agree, it does appear that way. But manipulation is not the best word. "Manage" would work much better because this is done in the spirit on national politics, not "internationalist control" as you often state!

------"Consider my hypothesis (I know you don't like this)"------ I "like" all discussion that offers
a "chain of thought" and / or the "sequence of events" that brings one to make their "logical" conclusion". These may be offered in many posts, over time, or all in one. If able, please state your "historical precedent, natural human tendencies or "feelings" that brought you to make a
statement. Facts are always good, but often unavailable.

------"Consider my hypothesis that all this manipulation is going on right now to facilitate the internationalists in exchanging dollars for euros. I know your thought is, like most others, that we are simply seeing the last gasp of the dollar as the US struggles to maintain the stock market,
etc."---------- Christine, many have read "my thoughts" many times and drawn their conclusions, good or bad. What are your thoughts? How did you conclude "internationalists are exchanging dollars for euros" not necessarily why? What do they gain?

-----------"Price of oil was raised firmly by OPEC in March. This was likely orchestrated in response to the euro being "ready to go."-------- Did you infer this from my thinking? Or do you have another "chain of thought" that makes this clear?

----------"Recently we have seen the tone of OPEC as well as the price of oil soften again some. Do you think it is possible that OPEC has been maneuvering for some additional advantage via controlling how rapid the price rise in oil is."--------- No. Reading through my posts should
suggest that their moves are much more slow and long term. The price rise in March, was because the Euro was "ready to go". However, is was a long term change. Again, I use the the thought of "management of price" in a political format, not "conspiracy" as you often infer that I do.

------------"My thought is that OPEC knows that the process of dollars to euros is underway, and they would have some leverage to gain advantage during this time" -----------This is very different from mine and Anothers thinking, as their "advantage" and "leverage" was established some time ago. Please read my posts and his Thoughts. What is the advantage and leverage you speak of? Are they buying dollars, or silver, farm land? Why do you think they would do this, your thoughts?

----------"A too rapid rise in price of oil would hurt the dollar and interfere with dollar to euro exchanges at a bargain rate. Just a thought."------------ How would the dollar to Euro exchange be interfered with by a rise of oil? And, what brought you to conclude this?

Christine (5/18/99; 20:07:09MDT - Msg ID:6424)
@FOA--I can only say bravo for your post today

----------" canamami states, 'As great powers go, the US is positively saintly, at least most of the time.'---------- (FOA note to Christine: I stated the next line ) I add that saintly actions will be a 'steep hill to climb' if the US dollar is threatened in a fashion that generated the German inflation leading up to the World war."

-----------"You have verbalized what I am very fearful of in a very different way than I have been able to. I feel the US has lost its way."--------------------I agree with this!

----------"Those that control our country are out of control. I don't know what can be done to stop them. And I don't know if we the people have the will to stop them. They will mislead us with many lies and false blame for what is going on. Will we the people be able to see what they are doing and the wrong of it."--------------- I did not say or imply this. This is your interpretation of my post. I concluded that it was the "people / citizens" , "NOT THE Leaders" that would demand action. Please read it #6403 again! Please explain "your theory" about "out of control
leaders" and how you came to that conclusion?

------------"And FOA, the only point we now disagree on, I realize, is that I do not think those who are running the US are going to be defeated by these currency events." ------------- What historical precedent, human tendency or sequence of events brought you to the idea that "currency events will not defeat them? In review of my many posts, one may conclude that the US / IMF factions will be defeated. Please read them.

----------"I do not think "they" have been outwitted or outmaneuvered."-------- Why?

----------"I believe that they have engineered this for their further gain and control." --------- How did they engineer this? Thoughts?

--------------- Christine (5/17/99; 23:37:04MDT - Msg ID:6374)@OverHerd If I understand you correctly, you are offering a similar argument as FOA. And certainly not implausible. But you raise one of the core issues that has made me a "conspiracy theorist" I do not think the BIS has some great wisdom or vision that the IMF does not. What I
mean is, IMHO, the IMF/dollar has been well aware of the eventual outcome of what it was doing all along, as has been the BIS. After all, someone else commented that there is much overlap in who are key players with BIS and IMF. The fact that the IMF must have anticipated the present situation just as the BIS must also, forces me to look for another explanation. I have concluded that this is a designed outcome by the IMF/dollar. ----------------

What actions has the BIS taken that leads you to this? If not actions, then what is the "sequence of events" or what "political advantage" would they gain. Their written history has always been one of "adversity" with the IMF. What actions have they recently taken that change this "feeling"?

----------Why would the IMF/dollar deliberately set the dollar up for a huge crash. For one thing, I think it will create the kind of economic disruption to convince the US citizens and Congress to start entering a global currency, as Martin Armstrong of the Princeton Economic Institute suggests is the goal.----------- I agree that this may be the outcome, but the only other currency to replace the current system would be the Euro. Unless the trend is changed, it will inherit the global currency system. The BIS is much more politically and financially aligned with the Euro. A review their many written articles will confirm this. You must offer how the IMF / dollar faction will benefit by crashing their system. Trillions of assets will be lost, long before they are exchanged for Euros. If your theory is that they are holding the Euro down to facilitate an exchange, then how will the lost assets be moved without spiking the Euro? The dollar faction would be wiped out , as I have stated in many posts. Please address these issues.

As OverHerd 6372 states: -------"The BIS is merely getting out of their way and letting them fall on their own." ---------
I absolutely agree with this assessment and do not offer that the BIS is in a "secrets deal" to bring down the dollar. Christine, that is your interpretation of my posts. The ECB, BIS and the Euro faction are only filling a void. Indeed, it is to their liking and have done nothing to support the dollar, rather it is a political / management operation, in place from the early 70s. The actions of
the private citizens and companies of this world will strengthen the Euro, as they leave the dollar. Not, the "industrial controllers theory" you subscribe to. We are very, very different in this aspect.

----Christine (5/17/99; 20:50:22MDT - Msg ID:6360)------------- "FOA, I do not use the term conspiracy in a derogatory way, although others may view conspiracy in that manner. I believe your hypothesis that there is a covert attack on the US dollar by the BIS is a conspiracy theory.-------------
My hypothesis does not and never has concluded that the BIS is operating a "covert attack". That is your interpretation. Just as stated above, they are working in the open as events reveal this.

---------"One of your main arguments is that in your opinion such a secret maneuver by the BIS would be both justified and necessary on the BIS's part, to save the world from dollar fiat currency" ----------- Wrong again!

------- I do agree that the world is in a mess now because of US dollar expansion/inflation. I do agree that we are going to see some dramatic economic events.------------- Agree.

----------"But your statements that the BIS has planned a secret attack on the US dollar to save the world from the dollar problem is strictly a theory" ----------- Your thoughts!

------------" I believe there are likely a number of equally plausible theories to explain events going forward. What is a theory versus a conspiracy theory. There really is not a difference in my mind" ------------- In my mind and many others there is a large difference.

-----------------You or others may say the BIS/euro motives for the hypothesized attack on the dollar are logical economic policy and high-minded, so therefore it is not a conspiracy theory. ----------- High-minded, no! Logical, yes, because they follow a historical political
precedent that continues, unbroken through this day. One must use a thinking process of evaluating past events to gain future perspective that is used successfully to guide national leaders today. You have not offered this to support your ideas, therefore they do remain in a "more theory" form.

--------"The BIS is doing this to save the world from the dollar. My opinion is the world needs to be saved from the BIS and the IMF, the euro and the dollar. What if I am correct that the US is the country that has been buying the gold, and is also planning a new euro-like currency, and the
game just goes on and on, only with further loss of freedom." ----------- Is this your "feeling" or can you offer "political analysis and history" for support?

-----------"I do not think there is only one interpretation of what is unfolding. It may be logical to assume the world needs a new reserve currency, but I would not be sure the US dollar can be simply overthrown."----------- History has shown that currencies are "overthrown" by citizens
failing to respect them. When people no longer want to hold or use a currency, it is thrown down from lack of value. "Internationalist" must conform with the medium of exchange and can only control a failing currencies use, not value. Therefore, they gain nothing from it. Christine, this is
not logic, it is the history of your past!

--------(But overthrow might be the best thing that ever happened to the US in terms ofstrengthening ourselves, our economy, and our freedom.) We are all either proposing theories, or we are all proposing conspiracy theories, but IMHO, I am not proposing a conspiracy theorywhile you are just reporting the inevitable logical valid scenario of what is going on. That does not mean that in the end you may not be 100% correct, FOA, but at this time we are all
unproven.--------------
As Another has said, "time will prove all things" and "the history of your past is before you"! My money is on the "never" changing history of human interactions with
paper currencies. A theory for some, real life for many.

-----------"I would be curious as to why you worry as to what those lurking will think"--------- I deplore the callous nature of that remark. We all search for understanding of current events in the context of how they impact our lives. I do not worry "as to what those lurking will think", rather, I am considerate of what they (and myself) understand"

I repeat my earlier post.

Christine,
Your position holds (#6305) that the world is coming together. The "power leaders" are working together to create a "one world" "all controlling" currency /economic system. If true, your thinking will rewrite history as the actions of the past are not supportive in this aspect.

Nowhere in the recorded history of mankind have world leaders "colluded" successfully without opposition!. Always, our earth has been broken into power groups that have fought each other. You will find no agreement from scholars, that our "human nature" supports the actions you

What you ascribe to would represent a true international "conspiracy" of a strange nature, as thepolitical elements would all be on the same side of the "gold position". They would "in effect" be buying gold from themselves. Nor do capitol flows indicate the US as the buyer. The vast pool
of dollars that support the purchase of gold, all reside outside that country. Indeed, the very concept of linking gold to the dollar, by the US would hasten it's demise under the current reserve system. You will have to resolve that conflict of political wills, for your thoughts to be
constructive. Also, you stated that the US could issue a new currency in the same format as the Euro. Again, you will have to resolve the debt / international currency reserve issue, residing with the dollar that is not present with the Euro.

Please do address these in depth, we look forward to your thoughts.

@FOA--Please help check my logic

------------------------------FOA, even though I have some economic education, it is not even in the ballpark of yours. In response to how the US would liquidate debt, I will have to rely on Mozel--

Date: Tue May 11 1999 05:04
mozel (@If I have this wrong, tell me.) ID#153110:
Gold is at about $300 in round numbers. If the greenback falls to 10,000 per ounce of gold, then Euro denominated debt will have an improved exchange value ratio against greenback denominated debt. The advantage will be a function of the ratio of gold as reserve and is
theoretically unlimited. The more greenbacks required per ounce of gold, the greater will be the improvement in the exchange value ratio. This circumstance has the potential to liquidate greenback denominated debt from the international monetary system pretty quick, I should think." -----------

------FOA, please give me your thoughts on this. After the dollar was devalued, assuming that the US has been accumulating much of the gold involved, then wouldn't it be
feasible to establish a new currency at the point, converting the old inflated dollars into new
dollars at some rate"----------

Christine, Mr. Mozel is an excellent thinker and uses his sharp mind to "make his point". The above is a fine example of the dynamics that support my statements. Among other things, it outlines the "impossible nature" of the US buying gold to back it's money or further create a new reserve currency. Long before this action was concluded "greenback denominated debt", the very assets that would be used to conduct the transaction, would be destroyed or immobilized!

------------"I have always contended that everybody who is anybody is busy right now exchanging their US dollars into euros-- those who have power will not suffer the devaluation. ----------------- True!

--------------"Once the devaluation is over, then they can move back into the new US dollar".------------
"Human emotions" and "historical logic" do not suggest that this would happen, even if a new dollar was offered, it would be "politically scarred". Besides, why move back? Just stay in Euros and or gold as they will perform the "one world currency" function you subscribe to.

-----------------"Regarding your second question/critique--I can only surmise that Western nations are hardly separate nations any longer. Whoever runs things(internationalists) already is esentially running things.----------------- OK

--------I would repeat my reference to Martin Armstrong of PEI's comments. Global currency implies a single global power. I have heard recited that historically a currency does not survive if the entities that use the currency are not politically as well as economically integrated. The
euroland countries are moving toward political union--that right there would go against what you suggest. How is it possible that euroland is cooperating and moving toward unity. -------------

It is not only possible, it is happening! Current events as reported daily point in the direction of unity. Even the American Enterprise Institute has commented on how the European family is finding happiness with the Euro system. If Martin has erred, it is in that the Euro will become the
very global currency he is looking for.

Christine, I offer this montage of comments (as TownCrier called it) out of respect to everyone's interpretation. Your thoughts / theories are interesting / enjoyable and I wish to read more of them. As events change the landscape, so does public opinion change political outcomes. More
analysis will be needed. Thank You FOA

FOA's morning course in Logic #101

Peter,
No one, including myself, always follows these protocols. Sometimes, I try to make a point over several posts using ongoing news events. Even the logic and knowledge of Another is still in the process of playing out over time (perhaps years?). My purpose was to address the many items Christine had applied to my writing, but I was never able to respond to. Even now there are several posts from others I want to discuss, but have no time.

Also: I have now completed another addition of bullion to my portfolio, as have many others. We shall see if I have the chance to "make more gold" if prices drop further. Several weeks ago I offered that "NOW" was the time to buy bullion, as it's price was in a stable range due to political changes. Even with the BOE "emergency" shuffle, gold has only dropped about $10US from the $283 range at that time. It would be "our loss" if the BIS does clamp down on the market, as this opportunity to "make gold" would be lost in a spectacular flash. It seems that most people still do not grasp how the currencies will react to a major spike in gold. I read where they are trying to find an entry point to buy gold stocks or futures, so as to sell (trade) for more paper on the upside. As Another says, the move in this market will be "as none before". Indeed, the dynamic
selloffs and runs will lock 90% of the traders out, and they will never ever, in their lifetime catch it again.

I don't know about everyone, but some people are "making gold" on this move! FOA

How long before the BIS intervenes?

Canamami,
I have to ask the same question, how long?
When one looks at the total exposure of longs in the physical gold market, it amounts to major money! It's major if for no other reason than the total amount of gold in existence is owned by "someone". Add to that the longs that have taken the opposite side of all of the short paper, and we have a huge block of real investors, many of whom are influential! Viewed in this light we can grasp that it isn't just gold miner stock holders that have a stake in the value of gold.

There is another class of gold owners that are the most influential of all, the Central Banks. Yes they are portrayed as the villains, but, "as a group" they have actually sold very little of their reserves as a percentage of holdings. A look through the WGC site will give details to confirm this. Most of the industry is consumed by the short side of the story and their connections to CBs.
However, the long side faction also represents some "big time connections" to the CBs and they share a common interest of not allowing gold to fall too far! The difference between the two groups is that the shorts utilize louder mouthpieces. I think Mr. R was talking again today! The longs are more quiet but are truly the larger guns. People in the background (Another?) already know where these players want the price of gold to stop. The public gets to hear it when the price passes a certain "no fly zone". TownCrier #6458 posted: "Market players today paid little
heed to statements by Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet, saying that France, US Federal Reserve, Bank of Italy and Germany's Bundesbank were not planning to sell their gold reserves."

All of these entities are major "ticket holders" on the BIS! Even the US is talking now, in obvious conflict with Mr. R..

Canamami, when I offered several weeks ago that now (then) was the time to buy, I said that the US was throwing in the towel on resisting an upmove in gold! They now want it higher, because all of the major benefits of having gold fall against the dollar (making it look strong) have
dissipated with the advent of the Euro. I offer this because the Euro is now the competition, not gold! The ECB stopped all gold sales / leasing this year because big money (oil) doesn't need to take gold any longer. It's a political "sea change" of huge proportions. That's also why I feel the
BOE made a sudden "emergency" turnaround and sold gold. They were not trying to force it down, they were wise to the "new currency competition" for the dollar, and what that implied for gold! As I said, they are only partially bailing out some of their favorite Bullion Banks (not Goldman S.) because the gold carry game is over. The US is now going to try and make some "political hay" out of the fact that it has a lot of gold, just like the Euro! Even though, it belongs to the US Treasury and is not treated the same as the ECB gold. It's will be seen as a ploy to attract
further settlement of international trade in dollars, if it has high priced gold in the background.

With Arabs tying with Iran, it's obvious they are about to "disinfluence" themselves to a small degree with the US. For them, a loud political statement like, "we will now settle oil sold to Europe in Euros" will be the beginning of the change. We have but to only look at how much oil
Europe gets from the Middle East to see how they are tied, trade balance wise. Note that England has now sent ambassadors to Iran. I posted this the other day, TownCrier, did you see it? All of these factors, lead me to see that Britain is going to drop dollar ties and head for Europe.

Thanks and welcome JC! My thought is that the BIS may wait for the US to privately push for gold through the contention that the LBMA has created a monster and let's do something. That would most certainly work politically for the US if England has "cut and run"! After all, London is the one on the hook if gold takes off. I can add more if this is not clear. Am open for interpretation or critique. Discussion? Anyone? FOA

@Aristotle
Don't you find FOA's words unusual--"If the trend is not reversed".

Christine,
You took my meaning as I intended. Thanks. I do believe that the ECB issued Euro will become the dominate currency system. Much as the dollar has to date. The largest difference between the two (Euro / Dollar) is found in how the exchange rate value of each is "Managed" for political
purposes.

The dollar is ruled by one country and one country only. This implies that only one Economy is taken into consideration when policy is discussed, the USA. The management of interest rates, inflation, dollar value and crisis intervention, are therefore politically motivated to benefit one world group, again, Americans. We have seen the news events of how this tramples upon the needs of other geopolitical groups (countries).

On the other hand, the Euro will utilize a totally different structure of consensus management. It
will be governed by many nations of obvious conflicting needs. This very weakness, that is so well documented by analysts, is the "major" strength that will contribute to the popularity of the Euro. In time, it will be governed by many cultures, including an "open market" valuation of gold.

Your observation of it becoming a "all controlling" system may come about. However, I submit that people will be drawn to it more so than the current "America only controlled" dollar system. I "feel" (my interpretation) that you are looking far across the valley of plenty, to observe the mountain of fear. Let's see how it works out as we (Another says) "walk this trail together".

The Euro and Gold

Hello Scotsman,
I don't know if gold will follow the Euro. It may at first, but I believe that all currencies will fall
dramatically against gold in the crisis atmosphere that is coming. Then, because the BIS and the ECB saw fit to isolate the Euro in, what is currently perceived as a private trading block, the Euro will be seen almost as the only alternative after gold. This perception of "geopolitical isolation" of Europe's money is working against it now, but will be an inspiring attribute later.

The countries that "make gold" from the ground will get a good run in their currencies, even as the authorities "try like hell" to keep them down. The Aussies will no doubt sell gold again, but this time in a rising market. Will the All Ords. follow gold later? Your call!

US treasury owns gold?.....the 260 million ounces the treasury is "suppose" to own is listed under "assets" on the weekly Fed data....260 mil.oz @ $42.50 = 11 bil...same number Fed uses.....so the citizens might not own anything...the shareholders of the Fed have OUR gold!

Chicken Man,
Have you ever tried to sell American Real Estate with a Deed full of attachments? If yes, then you know how it will be for the Federal Reserve to sell gold. Just because they say they own it doesn't mean they can sell it. It's held "for the benefit of the treasury" as an "asset of the Fed". Right now, the Fed would like to sell it privately "for the benefit of GS and LTCM and the like", but that would conflict with the treasury's rights. Don't you think Mr. R. would have sold it by now if it was available? As vocal as he is, it would have been published in the WSJ as each ounce was sold.

No, between the old BIS attachments (perhaps judgments is the better term) and Congress, the US gold is available only as a "talking tool". Besides, the BIS would only allow it to be "auctioned" off in the true meaning of the word. Just the way it was sold in the late 70s. That way they could buy some of it through 2nd parties. thanks FOA

"Rubin told the House Banking Committee:

"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted that the issue of U.S. gold sales had been debated in 1976 and the authorities had decided not to sell."

\`\`The reason is that gold still represents the ultimate form of payment in the world,'' he said.
\`\`Gold is always accepted ... and is perceived to be an element of stability in the currency and in
the ultimate value of a currency.''

future of US economy
I would maintain that the US has never been in better economic condition, except for the trade deficit. The US has low inflation, low interest rates, control of an emerging world economy where it holds all the cards: the computer hardware, software, internet, markets, money, language
(english future world language), management organization, accounting systems, laws, computer literate populace, best farmland, best factories, best transportation systems and best political system. We are a full blown democracy!. These are the reasons the $ stays strong and probably will continue to do so. For all the US's faults we are like democracy: "a terrible system except for all others" (sic). I wouldn't bet against the US economy.

Hello Koan,
I would like to comment on the above, and also an old post I think you produced some time ago. It was offered that the new currency of the world is now "knowledge"! A most interesting thought and one that has been considered by many of the "new age" investors of this era.

I agree, in that investors often hold their assets as the value (quoted on an exchange) of ideas and how that knowledge is used to create a better world. It has most certainly promoted a new "medium of exchange" that can, in this new day, be used as a currency.

The problem is that this is not a new concept! It is only new to those that suddenly grasp it as it pertains to this modern economic system. Truly, a search of history will produce many examples of people using "productivity enhancements" and "inventions" as wealth for centuries. It's only, the "meager form" of these old thoughts, as compared to modern advancements, that render them "different in concept to modern minds".

What this generation of "modern thinkers" is about to experience, is the "ages old" human emotions of greed, robbery, cheating and distrust. This old "mental baggage" comes back to haunt every "new era". It's only when people start cheating each other as economic conditions
deteriorate, that the "new currency of ideas" becomes fraudulent. This is the reason that, in the old days, the "medium of exchange" needed gold as the "medium"! When hard times force humans to steel, "knowledge" becomes a currency of "unknown" value because people always "hold back some of it" for insurance. Suddenly, the "trading of knowledge" as money, also needs a "medium" or "something in between the transaction" that has a long standing, trusted, historical value that completes the trade, "up front". Gold.
All that I have offered above also applies to the new concept of "paper money"! Yes, No?

In discussion of your above post: I submit that all of the favorable attributes, you subscribe to the American economy, were purchased using a "fraudulent" dollar reserve system. That system has cheated many world citizens into selling goods and "knowledge" to the US for far less than it
was worth! All of this to the benefit of the American consumer, yet cheating honest workers of a fair exchange. Truly, a new "medium" is needed. As for your "I wouldn't bet against the US economy", neither would I. My bet is for a replacement of the dollar in world trade. Yes, no?

Thanks for your thoughts, please continue! FOA

Further to SteveH's Question re US and BIS FOA,
Further to SteveH's question, at one point you said that the Europeans could pull out of the IMF once the new financial/currency order is established. What if the US simply pulled out of the BIS?
Then the right of the BIS to US gold at about $42.00 (which you once mentioned) no longer exists. One negative result of the negative balance of trade is thus eliminated. (Excuse me if my grasp of the currency settlement rules is shaky, but this field of knowledge is new to me.)-----

Steve, Canamami,

I want to discuss both of your questions, but first read what someone sent me from Mozel:

--------Date: Fri May 21 1999 04:35
mozel (@JP @What would your scenario be if you found out that USG has no gold) ID#153110:
to which to connect its paper legal tender ? Gold it has in possession, but how much of it has clear title ? How much is due BIS for claims ? How much is due other creditors that were seized from in 1933 without due process of law ? Claims of perpetual entities never go away. If USG exposes gold in its possession to settlement via its currency, it exposes the gold to claims and process. International Law outlaws 'R US ? Financial armageddon 'R our fate ?------------------

Right on target! It's the same reason we cannot go back to a gold backed dollar, the old dollar never lost it's international contract as an "exchange contract for gold" as in "the gold exchange standard". Read up on the history of how the dollar came out of this.

Just because the US said, in 71 that it would not ship gold any more does not mean the dollar isn't still a contract to represent it's old international obligations. Every analysts makes comments like, "let them sent their army if they want it", but that is simply not the way the world works. It's cheating, fair and simple! Why didn't the US send out all of it's gold at $41 to the ounce, then go
off the system? As Another say's, "think long and hard on that one"!

The entire international financial structure is based on procedure protocols that are not binding, repeat, not binding, but without them, the system will not work. If the BIS did not coordinate inter bank (CBs) transfers the whole system would stop. Using the same "line of reasoning", the US cannot just back it's currency with gold at say, $10,000 and start all over again. What manner of "rules of engagement" would prevent them from halting gold shipments again? "Come on", people of the world are not that stupid!

No, the dollar would have to be totally destroyed, and a new currency, sanctioned by the BIS, and most likely controlled by them, would have to be created. The US will go down to the wire before that happens, therefore, the Euro was created!

Canamami, The IMF is a function of the dollar reserve dynamic. If the IMF did not the guarantee dollar debt of countries that could not pay, it would start a chain reaction of dollar reserve destruction. When dollar assets (debt) is no longer serviced (interest paid and debt rolled
over) it no longer can be carried on the books as the backing for local currencies. Hence forth, all currencies that are based on this system are "imploded". Now you see why the IMF does such "perceived dumb" maneuvers, it's to maintain the dollar, not rebuild the foreign economies.

When the BIS, ECB and the other major world economies are ready to drop the dollar, they will stop supporting the IMF and pull out. The IMF "needs" their support, they do not need the IMF. Likewise, if the US ever disassociated itself with the BIS, they would simply stop all transfers of dollars and most likely buy gold in the open market with them! At that point the Euro would become the only tradable currency. Simple political blackmail, or should I say
"international protocols". It's nothing new, but some call it a new "world order conspiracy". They just haven't liven through enough years, as Another has. By the way, he is back from travels. I don't know if that means he will write? Thanks FOA

Further Comment
ALL: If you follow my logic in #6570, then you can also under stand why the US can never call in gold from it's citizens again! As long as they are using "dollars", the same dollars that were exchangeable into gold in the 30s, they cannot Rebecca it with gold. To reverse that decision
would open the American government up to lawsuits from local dollar holders to return gold at 41 (or whatever price). If they again, called in local gold, prior to re-backing the dollar, Everyone would demand, first the exchange of gold at the old price, then they would send in that gold! The
Government would "Never" risk it!

Yes, they could call the dollar "dead" and issue a new gold backed currency for "internal use". See my last post to understand why a new currency would be unacceptable "externally". But, that money would not function, as it could have no ties to outside transactions. Nothing would be
gained. As noted before, they would most likely encourage gold holding by citizens while taxing the local gold industry and private transactions. Still, a dyeing dollar will spell massive gold increases in value for private bullion holders as this proceeds. FOA

Julia, I get your point and will try to offer what you ask. Keep in mind that this is all like a chess game, with each player holding a different motive for their course of action. Just as has happened with Britain and the BOE thing. Their purpose differs greatly from the wants of the USA. Even the US was walking one direction and may now have changed that!
As for the citizen / investor, their perception of most modern political maneuvers is difficult at best because most Westerners have no formal education of real money and how the recent (20 years) events have been an anomaly.

Peter,
I read several articles / opinions about how the fed has talked "raising rates" while doing "coupon pass" operations (adding money). What a mess they are in! M3 (broad scale of percentage of money creation) has been falling for some time, even with the massive money creation (by the fed)
during this same period. The group view, from where I sit is that the world dollar expansion during the 90s has hit the end of it's mathematical ability. All of the various "carry trades", weather using currencies or metals, no longer add liquidity. They are being neutralized by an reserve asset
shift away from the dollar. This is not to say investors are buying Euros, but all it takes is a "pause for thinking" to change perceptions. That pause is slowing world money growth and it is being reflected in the local (US) money supply. What does this mean? The system is shutting down, stopping the fed from raising rates. We are at the very edge of a major world reaction to the loss of dollar liquidity.

Did you read the article in the WSJ on May 20 " The Dangers Of Derivatives, by Martin Mayer. What a fine piece! Many of the areas covered could easily be applied to the gold market. We are very happy that so much of this is coming out and more is to come.

Smoke and Mirrors, you say / ask? I find it interesting that so many of the world investors see these actions as new (not necessarily yourself). It has been going on so long, I forgot when it started. I guess, with so many fresh investors entering this arena, with "new era thinking" that they are shocked when finding out that things work this way. Yes, the derivatives action has taken on a "higher level" of respectability and use, but they are just a substitute for "ego insurance" by managers. It used to be if a maneuver went against your company, you lost a lot of money, the
business and your job! Now you lose all of that plus some other persons hedge. When they reapply for a job, they state that they had "insurance" but it didn't hold! Things never change.

It's hard to stay on the trail when people around you are being picked off. I have seen the exact thing you describe, happening in other countries also. The best advice is to get liquid and out of debt. Such a drastic change from what life was suppose to be like in America. A taller
order, indeed when we see "gamblers" and "major risk takers" offering up their lifestyle as something "everyone" can do if they just "apply themselves"! What isn't seen behind their success is the complete "immoral" business ethic that is applied in the process of "applying themselves"!

This kind of "dynamic" can infect an entire economic structure, as every person tries to grab a piece of a smaller pie. An education in reality, that teaches what the impact of false economic values can have on people that have trusted a paper prosperity. Holding gold through such an
upheaval will not be fun, and humor will come at a premium. However, as "Aristotle" says, "He who has the Gold, has the last laugh." Please

SteveH,
Would it work? You tell me? What is your opinion? Given a choice between two competing currencies backed with gold or silver and not considering political stance, where would you go? Everyone??

other thoughts:
Also, considering the current framework of economic conditions in Britain, I don't think they would want into the Euro either. However, would a floundering industrial base, soaring inflation and high unemployment, brought on by a failing dollar change their minds? Perhaps Another was
right, in that they will remain a "lost country", caught between a future prosperous Europe and a sliding America? It has happened before and may happen again.

The outcome of England is important to gold holders, if for no other reason than that is where LBMA is. The changing of London, from the "financial center" to the outskirts of a new geopolitical block would also rework the denominations of much of the worlds gold trading. I think this was considered when the BOE decided to close out some of it's bullion house loans.

The considerations of this are many and may require the support of a "star trek" computer, if it were not so busy. Michael, would the citizens change their minds? FOA

On the topic of England--- Did you know?
http://www.khaleejtimes.com/
BRITONS' love of fast food and curries received unusual affirmation this week after burger giants Burger King's launch of the world's first fast-food curry hamburger. Burger King unveiled its latest creation this week claiming the BK Masala Burger created a mix of two of the UK's most popular take-away food - hamburgers and curry. The Masala Burger features Burger King's usual flame-grilled beef patty topped with two onion bhaji rings and a spicy Masala sauce. The burger goes on sale today priced 99p.

A Burger King spokesman said the company had enlisted the help of curry experts from among its Asian franchisees to develop the new burger and that it had been given the thumbs up in taste tests among curry lovers. The burger will be launched with a television advert featuring at Bhangra band.

Curry is the most popular take-away meal in the UK with around £1.6 billion spent on Indian cuisine every year. A Burger King spokesman said: "By tapping into this trend Burger King is offering its customers the very best of the East-meets-West eating phenomenon."

The Masala Burger is the latest in a long line of ethnic variations from the two burger giants. McDonald's recently held an Italian themed season and previously ran a Chinese promotion.

ALL:

From a psychological viewpoint, I am always amassed when hearing people discuss the aspects of using common gold coins as currency. Usually it contains the phrase "how could the average citizen ever use gold, no one would know if it was real. Nor could anyone afford it when the time comes to use it, it would cost to much!"

Boy, these real life comments do indicate just how far western thought has traveled from a true understanding of commerce and the money that makes it possible. The people that made these statements (and many more similar posts, mentioned in text) are mostly, well educated, entrepreneurs with successful backgrounds in business management. All of them have a firm grasp of economic theory as it applies to their field. The basic concept is that you provide a "real"
product in "exchange" for so many units of another real product. In this case "product" represents, services, concepts, thoughts, entertainment, items or resources, etc.. The business of "exchanging" these "products" is what the world economy and life in general is all about. The human factor in all of this that the "worker"/ "creator" of these "products of exchange" operate in an even tradeoff. Nothing is gained or loss. Even the difference in human productive capacity allows for a "time / energy" balance.

It is only in the realm of "business" that a profit is made to coordinate the "exchange" of these "units of production". The profit is the difference in the value of the "exchangeable products" and by definition cannot be anything different. We all know that in today's world, a "medium of exchange" is used to compare the diverse values of "products in exchange" so one may fairly determine the "business profit". We also understand that this profit is not the "medium of exchange itself", rather it is the value of the "excess products from the exchange" that this "medium" may purchase.

From this point on, it seems that most people have lost the concept that the "medium" truly has no value, and never has. It is only a "subjective evaluation" in the human concept of product trade. The medium has "use", not value, and the "need" for that use is manifest by the value of billions of transactions of products done daily.

This brings us back to the original comments above. If we hold a dollar in one hand and a gold coin in the other, everyone will agree that the gold has value. This is obvious, however, the dollar is used daily for trillions of transactions and it has no value what-so-ever! So why the concern as to "is the gold real", yet no oponion of the dollar? It is it's "use" as the "medium" that generates the
human "need" to poses it. Not it's value as a commodity. Therefore, when one "needs" the use of a new "medium" to exchange products, we have but to look for it's "use" among people to affirm it's "authenticity" as a currency. In other words, when you see many others around you using gold
as money, just as using the dollar, don't worry if it's real money, it's use say's it is!

To conclude: Don't expect the commodity value of gold to generate it's use as a "medium of exchange". The commonly used phrase "it has value as a commodity, therefore it's money" was never the reason gold has maintained it's demand as money. That may have been the reason it "evolved" into money (read it's history at WGC site), but it's not the modern reason it's needed. Gold in your hand need not represent any more value than a paper currency for it to gain the "need" for use. Paper currencies will destroy their own ability to be useful "mediums", as the weight of the very debt that created them becomes "overwhelming". People will grasp and "use" gold as a replacement, because history has proven it to be the only money that the weight of
billions of daily transactions cannot corrupt. Unlike government controlled "paper debt currencies", gold can and will increase in "it's unit of product exchange value" to accommodate it's "need" for "use" as a "medium". It's use and need will, no doubt, be reflected in it' new paper
currency price.

As this transition occurs, remember, in this new roll, it's not something you "afford"! Just like the present dollar, "it's something you earn for it's use". FOA

Dorchester,
I think it would be imprudent or harsh for me to just comment or reply to your post. Or to clarify what you suggest of our origin. Therefore, I will offer what I feel and what I see. Much of it learned from Another.

What you have said, not only strikes at the heart of who we are, but where all of us are traveling. It could be said that it is a snapshot in time. For you, I know that picture represents the moment of the entire journey. Truly, it is not.

The worldly knowledge we have gained during our travels in life does represent part of our wealth. Sometimes a price is paid in real things so that people gain in experience equal to the history they never lived. The scale of such wealth is measured by the loss one takes to gain that
moment in time. For many, this moment pays a lifetime of return!
Some become lost in this moment and never find the path that leads from this forest of emotions. Trapped are they by knowledge because fear rules the heart. The mind is indeed willing but the feet will not move. So, as it is in the poem "Pioneers", so must it be for you, the first step taken will thus define the trail.

Dorchester, others would divide the assets, they wish to redirect into ten parts. Sell the first ten percent and convert it to the wealth of the ages. With this move, mentally, the path becomes clear. As gold rises each five percent, sell the next ten percent and so on.

"Good fortune follows a determined path". Therefore, make your trail clear, for yourself first, and you will not walk this journey alone. FOA

Gold
USAGOLD, and all,
Now it should be easy for everyone to see that the gold market has become two separate operations. One is the physical and the other as a paper market. This new paper market was created and encouraged so as to increase the base of gold owners world wide. This increase could not have been accomplished prior to the 1990s because, basically only physical gold was traded in size, worldwide (comex futures were much too small then) and the dollar price of gold
would have exploded, thereby shutting down any expansion of ownership. As gold was the only competition for the dollar at that time, the BIS embarked upon this "encouraged" expansion as a means of offloading dollar reserves into gold at a decreasing price. It was known then and now that much in the same way the US / IMF controls the dollar market, the BIS manages the gold market. In this light, one can understand why certain entities would willingly buy gold , at a decreasing price, as a means of adjunction the settlement of trade in dollars. With the confident
knowledge that each dollar of paper gold purchased, during an extended time would eventually represent ten, twenty, or thirty times the present reserves.

At some point in time, the BIS would help deploy a new reserve currency that could be used to "settle" all paper gold trades that could not be closed, to the benefit of the paper gold holders. To further encourage / guarantee this "new market" the BIS would not allow gold to fall under
$280. With the successful launch of the Euro, the BIS / ECB will now allow the paper gold market to "implode" from it's own weight! As such, we arrive at today's point with gold
ownership, some ten times what it was during the 1980s. Most of this "dollar contract" gold cannot and will not be delivered, because "there was never enough gold to satisfy these contracts at present dollar prices"!

My friends, the choice is now "clean" and "clear"! The writers of paper gold "outside" the Euro realm are cornered with the lack of available gold! Completely! Presently, from inertia, they still control the "paper price" in the dollar / IMF arena, but they can never convert. They must do what
any cornered being will, continue to create (short) contracts of worthless nature. At some point, their market will suffer a total collapse and cease to function. It will happen no other way. Now we understand why England must enter the Euro world, if they are to have any hope of saving
some part of LBMA. One can also see why the US will encourage a higher "world" price for gold, even as it's native market is destroyed! Politics will always make good use of a unretractable situation. That being, the US has a gold reserve it can "talk about" but can do nothing with, on a large scale. Perhaps, a western reason to buy gold for cash "now", as it's local market may soon end?

Perhaps, this is why Another (long ago, in the $350 range) pointed only to the physical gold, for ownership. Much of what was said, makes sense now. The call for $280 gold was made some time before the Euro was born, and no one even knew if it would happen (BIS either???). The point that this was a "New Gold Market", "unlike none before", in that the dollar market of gold would totally disappear in a blaze of paper fire! Not to mention that the entire world gold industry is on a "dollar gold contract" standard. Is it no wonder that no analysts of the gold industry can afford to see the outcome of Another! Conversely, every free citizen, worldwide, that holds and continues to buy physical gold will welcome this change. Dynamic times, indeed! We speed
quickly to the conclusion of one of the greatest changes in currency values ever seen. thank you FOA

More on Gold.
SteveH (5/26/99; 20:15:31MDT - Msg ID:6767)

An addition to my #6766.
SteveH,
I missed your earlier question. The physical buying of gold, in coin and small bullion form is the smallest portion of real demand. As such it is the easiest to supply. "Big money", of world proportions does not travel into these areas. I have written of this in other posts. Over the years, the large private and almost private holders of gold physical have slowly sold it to purchase paper gold. This trend is the very action that multiplies gold ownership and supplies the demand deficit. Large holders still consider their new paper as gold. A good deal of that paper is as good as the real thing, but some of it will have to be converted into a Euro currency in the future. That trade
will be to the benefit of the holder, if it has ECB genealogy.

One of the reasons this trend worked so well is because the US went for it, early on. A falling gold price encouraged a strong dollar and offered Western dollar holders an avenue to hold gold in leverage form. An action they will, no doubt regret, later, as it has taken the form of stripping gold from western hands. For them, this new allocation allowed for free dollars to earn a return. Do not confuse these entities with non-western dollar reserve holders, as they (mostly) purchased straight gold future certificates (with BC backing) using resources as the leverage, not gold. Usually, this was the actual gold in the CB vaults as it was leased out, but never moved. Truly,
this was the source of the same money that went into mine forward sales (barrick?). The gold and the money stayed in the CB house and control. The entire above outline is why some analysts (Ted Butler?) cannot understand why the gold doesn't physically move, yet physical demand is being supplied. This conversion process was accounted for in the LBMA volume, as it became evident after gold fell below $360US. It was then, and only then that LBMA announced these
huge monthly transactions. Truly, it was here that one could witness the dollar being removed from it's reserve status. For many, it was the only public conformation they would ever get.

I think this view of "one world electronic currency" is a "joke" on investors. The entities that are now locked into standing behind short positions are trapped and will be saying anything to get investors to sell physical into the market. The black hole they are sinking into will crush them from the weight of all the further paper sales they must now make.

As the ECB faction has aligned itself with physical gold and cut off any new supply, the mines found themselves in the only position of having to continue to sell forward because they are part of the dollar gold market (see my #6766). A process of taking in ground gold reserves from the
stock holders. The entire industry of mining and trading dollar future gold is failing. Even now their paper has value only if the fabricated dollar gold price continues to fall. The time has arrived to witness the final destruction of the US market for gold. As the authorities have taken the stance of allowing this action to play out, it will later create a phenomenal spike in the "real" physical gold
market as all futures "lock up "from lack of backing. They will become worthless because the only way to support them is by selling more paper short, an action that will be stopped when it can but political votes (by you're SEC?). It's an obvious contradiction, that is becoming visible to
everyone. In such an atmosphere, I expect the US to state that the futures gold market is a threat to the public good and allow only physical sales (at huge increases in dollar price). I would also not be startled to see the BIS take this moment to buy gold. The dollar would "implode"
worldwide! Now you can see why many of the local US Bullion Banks are now truly trading for their lives.

I believe many investors ( myself included) are executing "final" transitions into physical gold. As events play out, this course of action should be a rewarding one.

I will be busy for several days. FOA

Major Currency Battle Now Underway Masked by Equity Bubble
by
SteveH

Current economic events boil down to a two economic forces at work that
essentially divide the world into two camps: debt holding countries of
the US dollar and countries who are distancing themselves from US debt
by way of physical gold possession and the Euro. All current world
events seem to be explainable when viewed in this manner. The two camps
are the US/IMF faction and the Euro/BIS faction. The US/IMF camp is
dollar based paper and debt; the Euro/Bis camp is gold-based currency
and gold bullion and oil.

The current run up in the US dollar and equities market is a result of
the skewed influence of the US dollar in world economic events and shows
its strength when viewed from its holding the existing role of the world
reserve currency. It is this role of 'reserve currency' that is the
center focal point of a currency war currently in progress. This war is
masked by the power and control of the media of the US/IMF faction and
by the apparent strength of the dollar and the dollar stock markets. It
is this apparent strength that blinds all of us to the hidden currency
war now playing in the world's markets. But it is this media influence
that hides the battle from our view. Yet knowing that the battle is
progress does provide a perspective from which current economic events
become crystal clear.

The strength of the dollar might be its aquilles heel, though. The
equities market in the US has been fueled apparently by two major
sources of funds: baby boomer 401K mutual funds and Yen and Gold-carry
money. It is this latter source of money that has just now come into
question as legitimate and healthy -- just look at Japan's economy and
what the YEN carry trade has done there. It is the gold-carry trade that
maybe the David of the dollar Goliath or the hair of Samson, the dollar.

Carry trading in Yen and Gold is simple to understand. It is borrowing
Yen or gold at a low interest rate, selling it into the market -- which
drives the price down and the dollar up -- then buying US bonds or
equities at a higher interest rate. The loan is repaid and the
differential interest is pocketed, and the process is repeated for as
long as the price of the YEN and gold drop. Not long ago, the YEN carry
trade was essentially stopped. More recently the gold carry trade has
been slowed or stopped to, but in the case of gold-carry, many of the
many borrowers of gold rolled over their loans and NEVER paid them back.
This is because they didn't have to until NOW. Now the gold price is at
or below production cost for most mines. Once the Central Banks (mostly
Europe) stopped leasing gold a short while ago, the estimated 14,000
tons of gold that has been involved in the gold-carry trade needs to be
paid back. It is impossible to pay it back in gold as most of the
Central Bank loans demanded so now it would seem that the financial
parties in the gold-carry business need a source of gold to pay back
these loans. It appears that only two escape hatches exist for the
gold-carry players. Keeping the price of gold down by shorting it on
COMEX (this is akin to naked shorting as insufficient gold bullion
doesn't appear to exist to cover the 200,000 open interest contracts) or
repaying the loans in a medium acceptable to the banks who loaned the
gold in the first place. It seems as though the Euro may become the only
accepted means of repayment.

One can see that the carry trades have driven the Yen and gold to all
time recent lows. In the case of the YEN more can be printed or made
available for repayment. In the case of gold, only 2500 tons of gold are
mined each year. To cover the 14,000 (alleged) shortage of gold would
take over five years at current production levels.

The remarkable thing about the carry trades is the shear number of
financial institutions who have participated in it. In other words, the
carry trade is pervasive and to unwind it will affect major world
financial institutions.

So back to the war of the Euro/BIS and the dollar/IMF. Two anonymous
representatives of the Euro/Bis camp have for the past two years come
forward with their interpretation of events. They have used the Internet
as their medium of discussion and have provided a tome of information
and opinion on this hidden war now unfolding. I believe they believe
they came forward after the cards, have been played that will ensure the
outcome of the currency war for title of world reserve currency ends up
in the Euro/Bis camp.

Let me explain. They claim that the BIS and the European Central banks
allowed the gold-carry trade to go on for years to proliferate
gold-based debt and ownership worldwide, using leasing as gold leverage.
Now it has become so pervasive that much of modern financial
institutional debt is a direct result of the carry trades, especially
gold-carry. Simply put, gold is the payment due in short order.
Insufficient physical gold stock exists free and clear of central bank
vaults and mining production of many major mining companies is hedge up
to 10 years hence that the only way to pay back without gold appears
destined to be Euros.

In other words, somebodies were suckered. Nearly risk-free (or so they
thought) interest money was available through the carry trades that
everyone got on board that knew about and cashed in. The result? The
Central Banks are owed an alleged 14,000 tons of gold with interest by a
wide-variety of institutions. Now you can see why they believe that the
dollar/IMF faction has lots. They can't pay back their debts without
converting to gold or Euro's and that means converting US bonds and
equities into Euros or gold. Since their is virtually no physical gold
to be had, we see gold continuing to be held back in price and kept away
from the $300 number that could trigger a failure of the COMEX exchange.

Now, light has been shed on the hidden battle for reserve currency. Up
until the Euro was introduced the only possible competitor for world
reserve currency status was gold. Gold doesn't lend itself freely for
exchange. (hard to email it) But with the introduction of the Euro with
nothing near the debt load of the US dollar and 15% in reserve
currencies being that of gold bullion, a proxy for gold was born that
can now compete with the dollar for the reserve currency status.

So, look now at recent world-wide financial events using the above as a
filter:

--Gold approaches $292. Bank of England announces a sale only available
to members of the LBMA (London Bullion Market Association). Price of
gold drops to a 20 year low.

--IMF announce a sale of gold to help poor countries (who would have
benefited more if the price of gold was higher as most them were
countries with producing gold mines.

--Swiss vote on a national referendum to delink gold from the Swiss
Franc and it passes.

--Major TV and printed press publish countless stories about gold is
dead, gold is no longer a modern requirement for currency. People become
confused by this. Gold's popularity falls to an all time low. Gold no
longer acts normally during major world crisis. Normally it would rally
in the event of war or inflation.

--Major rumors of Goldman Sachs and other investment banks heavily
shorting gold on Comex further holds gold down during these major
world-crisis.

--Formation of GATA (Gold Anti-Trust Action) committee to investigate
the apparent manipulation in gold markets. --Recent announcements of
copper and drug company price fixing.

The list goes on and on.

Where are we today? If you asked the two anonymous person called ANOTHER
and Friend of Another who post at the www.usagold.com web site and who
used to post on the www.kitco.com web site, they would tell you that in
their opinion, we are seeing the last leg of the dollar as the world
reserve currency and that the Euro will soon replace it in that
capacity. The would further tell you that when that happens, in their
opinion, that the COMEX gold exchange that trades in gold futures will
cease to function or become totally ineffective in establishing the true
value of gold in US dollars as the open interest contracts that trade
their can not be satisfied by physical gold as it is all spoken for.
Because of that, they would say that gold will rise to over $10,000US
per ounce. They have said that owing physical gold is the only true
measure of secure safety for ones wealth.

As extreme as that opinion is, recent events behind the scenes seems to
point to their theory of current gold markets events as the only one
that plausibly explains why gold and the dollar are behaving as they
are, why it seems that gold is being held back no matter what the cost.
I for one am open to any suggestion as to what else could really be
happening. But for now, I think Mr. ANOTHER and Friend of ANOTHER have a
message worth understanding.

Some of discredited Another and FOA (Friend of Another) because they
made a few predictions based on a timeline that in hindsight wasn't
entirely under their control. Because humans can't predict the future
rather only report it when the future is past, we shouldn't really
discredit the A and FOA message because a timeline is tampered with or
changed due to events beyond their control. If we remove the predictive
or human element of prediction or surmise from the A and FOA message
what remains?

I believe that what the A and FOA message represents is the inside track
of a powerful group of nations that have difficulty with the debt load
of the US/IMF faction and the negative influence this debt will
ultimately play upon them. The A and FOA thread then becomes one of
viewpoint within the larger realm of world economies that essential have
two major influences: the US/IMF faction with the dollar as the reserve
currency (major players are US/England/Japan) and the Euro/Bank of
International Settlement (BIS) with the European Union Countries and the
Bank of International Settlements. From their standpoint, they believe
the Euro has already won because gold is owed by so many institutions in
the US/IMF camp that it is too late for the dollar not to succumb to its
own debt load. They believe that what we are witnessing now is the last
act of the dollar as a reserve currency. Like it or not, their opinion
deserves to be heard if not for the sole purpose of the US/IMF faction
to gracefully deal with its current situation with the full
understanding of what exactly might just be going on.

The following is an actual exerpt from Friend of Another. You can see
within this text much of the substance I address above. The introduction
is by the Michael Kosares who was the editor of the "In the Footsteps of
Giants" and the system operator of the Gold discussion group at the
www.usagold.com web site.

8/10/98 Friend of ANOTHER

(Editor's Note: Please read what's below carefully. This is an
extraordinary analysis from the Friend of ANOTHER at a time of much
confusion and uncertaintly in investment/currency markets. We are told
at the outset that the largest pro-gold groups -- the Europeans and the
Gulf states -- want a world currency "not subject to the performance of
the American economy." In other words, a currency not tied to American
treasury obligations, or the percpicacity of any other nation for that
matter. That currency for those of us who have reached for the deeper
truths of economy is called gold. As an American, I must say that I have
never seen the concept of American hegemony explained in quite the same
way before. Perhaps, my eyes were closed. I keep getting this feeling
that Americans must necessarily begin to understand a new role for this
country in a rapidly changing international political and economic
environment -- a role for which our political and economic institutions
appear ill-prepared. I will not be so presumptuous as to explain what
the Friend of ANOTHER is saying, I will let you read for yourself. I do
not think it could be said any better than Friend of ANOTHER says it.
The fact that his analysis implies how one should design one's portfolio
is a happy side benefit.)

Michael Kosares,

It has taken some time to send this, but now I can also offer my
thoughts to your questions.

Your statement: "As a matter of long term policy, do you believe that
ECB will "sell" gold to defend the Euro or "buy" gold to defend the
Euro? Each of course would entail a different course of action with
respect to reserves of the new national bank. Along these lines,will ECB
buy gold from its member treasuries, or will it simply force them to
transfer it to ECB coffers if needed to defend the Euro? I am prompted
to ask this question in view of your assertion that there will be much
selling of Euros to defend the dollar. If the Euro, as you suggested, is
being printed to buy dollars isn't this just another manifestation of
the U.S. exporting its inflation? It appears to me that the Euro will
need to be defended -- and not with dollars -- but with gold! "

Michael, I believe the most difficult part in understanding the modern
gold market is overcome by seeing all the various political factions
involved. Essentially and basically, the largest pro gold groups are
those who want a world currency that is not subject to the performance
of the American economy. At this moment and in this period of economic
history, all currency reserves held by foreigners (non-Americans) is a
debt of the US Government and by extenuation through tax collection, a
debt based on the ability of the American economy to function
profitability!

In essence, America has told the world that as long as the business of
this country is functioning, your wealth, as represented in Marks, Yen,
Pesos, etc. is backed with performing US debt. It's like saying, "as
long as your neighbor, next door, does not loses his job, you will not
lose all your money! Most people would be surprised at how clear this
is, outside the USA sphere of influence. This, the largest of the pro
gold group, is largely made up of countries with economies that have no
need to sell most of their production to the US. The business of these
communities would not totally fail without the American engine. Yes,
they would slow down, but not collapse, as trade with other countries
would continue. To add what was said before: If your neighbor loses his
job, you can still trade with the other people in the town, as long as
the currency system is not based on your neighbors debts!

This group, made up of much of Europe and the Middle East, is not
looking for a return to the old Gold Standard, but perhaps something far
better. They do not see any advantage in holding the currency bonds of
one country, as a reserve asset of future payment, over holding physical
gold as a reserve asset in full payment. The fact that the debt reserve
asset pays interest is little more than a joke in these banking circles.
Any paper currency, the dollar included, can fall in exchange value
against your local currency far more than the interest received! In
today's paper markets, the only true value in exchange reserves, held by
a government as currency backing, is found in it's effectiveness for
defending the local currency from falling against other currencies. In
other words, use the reserves to buy your countries money. But, this is
a self defeating action as sooner or later the reserves are used up!
This fact is not lost on many, many countries around the world, as they
watch their currencies plunge, lacking reserves as defense. Ask them how
important the factor of earning interest on reserves is under these
conditions.

On the other hand, buying gold on the open market, using your local
currency, works as a far different dynamic from selling foreign
bond\\reserves. This action takes physical gold off the market, and in
doing so increases it's value in dollar terms. Gold is and always has
been the chief competitor with the dollar for exchange reserve status.
The advantage here comes from the fact that governments do not run out
of local currencies to use in buying gold, as opposed to selling foreign
currency reserves to buy the local currency on the open market. Of
course, the local price of gold goes sky high, however, in this action
you are seen as taking in reserves, not selling them off.

Also, as gold begins to rise against the dollar, the local gold reserves
are seen as assets of increasing value, backing the local currency.
Under these conditions, with a stable currency, citizens will purchase
more gold as it is seen as a positive asset. Not unlike a rising stock,
everyone wants an increasing investment. Contrast this action against
that in Korea, where everyone sold gold as it increased in an unstable
currency!

Basically, this is the direction the Euro group is taking us. This
concept was born with little regard for the economic health of Europe.
In the future, any countries money or economy can totally fail and the
world currency operation will continue. What is being built is a new
currency system, built on a world market price for gold. Michael, you
are absolutely correct in that the USA will see a hyper inflation of
it's currency and a gold price in dollars that reflects it.
Unfortunately, for most investors, the gold price rise will be sudden
and also hyper fast. as it will occur just after a rapid plunge in
dollar based assets including, stocks, debt and the entire banking
system. This action will destroy virtually all gold based paper assets
as they are also dependent on a functioning economic system. A local
gold mine, in any country, must sell production to realize a profit. The
contract system they deal with will not be functioning during this time.
Contrary to many hopeful investor, local treasury officials will not
allow miners to pay employees or buy equipment with physical gold. When
the dust does clear for mining to continue, gold will be recognized
worldwide as real money, and the mining of money will, no doubt, carry
Extreme taxation. Stock prices of these operations, after being priced
to zero, will then double or triple in price. Zero times three equals?

Back to your original question. The Euro will not replace gold, it will
evolve into a gold transactional currency. It will also price Euro gold
very high, perhaps $6,000 in current dollar terms buying power. However,
in actual dollar terms of the future, $30,000 US will reflect the
American debt as the negative reserve asset it truly is. The ECB will
have an easy time issuing Euros to buy gold from the member banks. The
real political warfare will be in trying to force them to sell the gold
at all, once this ball starts rolling. The Euro has, in effect already
been dispersed in the form of Gold Leases not gold sales. One has only
to look at the official gold holdings of most central banks to see that
physical gold sales are little more than the average, with a good amount
of that coming from nonEuro countries. Gold is a funny thing, it can be
sold many times and pass through many countries and still remain in a CB
vault. Truth Be told, some 14,000 metric/ton have been sold this way.
Far more than the street thinks. Using this amount it's easy to see how
certain entities have moved off the dollar standard in the last few
years. If we use a future price of $6,000+US, the move is about
complete.

The process: An oil country (or others) goes to London and purchases one
tonn of gold from a Bullion Bank. The BB borrowed this gold from the CB
(leased). The one tonn gold certificate is transferred to the new owner.
The gold stays in the CB vault and the owner goes home. The CB leased
this gold to the BB and expects it to be returned plus interest. The BB
financed the Actual Purchase of this gold mortgaging assets of the
buyer. The BB, who created the loan, then uses the cash arranged in this
venture to contract with a mining company (or anyone wanting a
gold/cross financing deal) to purchase production gold, using this cash
to pay for it. In the eyes of the mining company, the BB just sold gold
on the open market, for cash, and will purchase future production at the
contracted price. The mine does not know where the gold came from, only
that it was sold and a fixed cash price is waiting. Of course, most of
this made more sense when gold was higher. There were thousands of these
deals, structured in every possible fashion. Look to the volume on LBMA
and you see where the future reserve currency is traded today!

Now when we look at this picture, who is at risk here? The Euro CB Group
still holds the physical gold and will buy it back from the new owners,
if asked, using printed Euros. The new gold owner has just replaced his
dollar reserves with either bargain priced gold, or Euros at an exchange
rate never to be seen again! Some of this was done to buy the pricing of
oil in Euros. The BB owe the CBs 14,000 tons of gold that they must
collect inthe future from producers or currency speculators. And they
must collect it by paying what will be a, then, ridiculous price of
$300/$400US, while the world market price will be, well, a little
higher.

With Canada, Australia, and perhaps England having sold much gold to
hold US$, much of the English speaking, IMF/dollar world is about to
change. Any country, Japan, Mexico, etc., that has locked their future
by selling most of their production to the American economy , is headed
for a depression. Another is answering some of your mail questions and
is also sending a letter. Will send it on arrival.

Steve,
I want to thank you very much for your clarifying post (#6820). There is little I can say that would change any aspect of it. You have presented these views in a manner that reflects a "local" style of thinking. For many, it will now be much more clear to understand.

I am not and never could be Another. My writing is an effort to further his thoughts to conservative people that wish to grasp future events in their true light. Not the illogical, often conflicting reasoning presented by "money traders in need of clients", "the media in need of viewer
ratings" or "political leaders holding debts that control their public pronouncements".

Another's reasoning and writing can be summed up as such (my writing / editing of his words):

"If someone knows who you are, they will first look to your status as confirmation for your Thoughts. The message receives not true consideration. Indeed, why betray your close friends and associates by divulging "privileged and private information", what means of honor have you
gained by presenting this same into public view? Nor does it build the character and reputation for someone that acts upon this new knowledge by making the unfair deal ahead of their friends. No, it is better for people to "travel their path" using the signposts of "human nature", so readily
displayed along the trail. If we state that a bolder is about to roll down a hill, most would not hear it. So let us show why the rock occupies the hill for the wrong reasons. Some will openly berate others for considering such nonsense. But, truly, behind the quiet mind, the fair person with an ear for such pronouncements will keep the most private eye upon the hill.

"the profit in life is paid in the honor never received, for respect has no price higher than when truth is displayed for free"

Eddie Georte: British Gold Sale "A Very Sensible Portfolio Decision" http://finance.uk.yahoo.com/news/19990525/businessday/busstory142283.html
"He (Eddie George) dismissed accusations that the policy was a device to prop up the ailing euroas 'conspiracy theory gone to extreme'.

Towncrier asks: "What happened to the days when central bank reserves existed to defend one's currencies, not garner the best returns?"-------------------

TownCrier,
The above is only part of your post, but still an important part. Most of the public discussion concerning the BOE gold sales revolves around the obvious. Such as "they sold gold to bring reserves in line to join the Euro" or "they leased gold earlier and now this move is just to cover
those leases gone bad" or it was "open manipulation because they announced it first in order to push down the gold price".

My point all along was that they did none of the above. Your statement, TC, is the closest to the truth. Let me explain:

If they (BOE) were selling gold as a direct course to join the Euro, they would have handled it exactly in the same manner as the Dutch and other EMU nations did. Sell the gold quietly and direct it towards contract completion. This was done quietly to bring the best trade and to deliver
the gold into "private EMU friendly" hands. All of the pre EMU deals were done in this fashion and the BOE would have done the same "IF" the purpose was for "reserve balance" prior to Euro application.

It is true that they are active in the gold leasing market. No one would expect anything less when the members of the LBMA are so very close to the BOE. I believe one of the members is the very agent for the government! (Someone here should be able to help confirm this for the group). However, this new sale of gold could never be used to "square the books" for gold already leased because the old leased contracts were done at a much higher price. The "auction" would have to be concluded at a much higher price than today for the numbers to match. A rare event, indeed!

The open announcement of sales did move the dollar price of gold, but that was not the purpose of this "verbal action". They had no choice but to announce, because they (BOE) were about to sell "unencumbered" physical vault gold to LBMA members. It was an obvious public statement to show that the LBMA had a "line" on "freed up real gold" to satisfy "a pressing situation"! Someone in the world community needed to know that this "future" gold was available with no way to reverse the sale. A public statement does just that! The credibility of the BOE to
perform was put on the line. Otherwise, the sale would have been held quietly and privately, over time, just as the EMU sales were.

Back to your item, TC, "What happened to the days when central bank reserves existed to defend one's currencies, not garner the best returns?". Well you have hit the nail exactly upon the head. This BOE gold "IS" currency reserves and it was being used to defend the currency. Only,
it was not the pound that was being defended, it was the dollar! As USAGOLD once said, some nations grow weary of using their reserves to back a foreign reserve currency, so to do the british grow tired. Because they were part of the IMF / dollar faction (thanks again Steve #6820), England used the services of the LBMA and the gold reserves of the BOE to help strengthen the dollar. They expanded the gold supply (and world ownership) by selling various paper gold
securities. They did this because the dollar is "their" reserve currency also, it mainly backs the pound! Today, we come to a point where a major reserve currency change threatens every dollar holding nation, and London is in danger of becoming the "odd man of Europe" during this time.
With the BIS having succeeded in leveraging the dollar into the brink of "implosion" Briton must make a dash for the EMU, even if the resulting "dollar slaughter" will destroy their LBMA through an exploding physical gold price. This, my friends, is what the BOE gold sale is all about. They
are clearly saving a small portion of their bullion bank empire prior to EMU. The sale has nothing to do with "balancing reserves" to meet ECB criteria.

Many words to make a small point. On to other comments. FOA

"For those who say this has been an exceedingly long and dark period for gold, I would counsel that these cycles play out over many years period of time. The stock bear market that started on a constant dollar scale in 1965 did not come back to the level from which it first descended until
1982-83. Similarly, the stock market high of 1929 was not reached again until 1942. Bear markets can be long and merciless but always darkest before the dawn. Gold's overdue, Steve, but I still wouldn't go out and load up future's contracts or call options."------

Michael,
A very nice post. I read it all. Your last item should give people an idea of how long term these things can be. We must all remember that the perspective that most analysts write from (the last Barrons article?) is only using the action of gold from 1975+/-! They do not allow the "history of paper currencies" to influence their thinking. The US dollar is only some 30+/- years old when one considers how long it has been off a gold standard. During that time it has created more debt than has ever existed during the use of "any" form of money! Truly, a failure of this modern paper would turn the current analysts of gold on it's head and make the wait seem like only a moment in time. We will see it happen and chronicle the results on this forum.
thanks for providing it, FOA

Gold seen well supported near lows.
http://www.barney.co.za/reuters/may99/gold25.htm
Flemings global mining group said in a report:
The unique liquidity provided by Central Bank lending to the Gold market had prevented severe lease rate spikes, allowing the market to be played for the short side for extended periods.((3long years)).
While it was hard to say when this dynamic would change, for now and while there was negative sentiment,"this structure creates an Achilles heel which invites attack,"Fleming said. Click above URL for more.------------------

Hello beesting,
Boy, "unique" is the right word! If I wanted to expand a market, the best way to do it is to offer almost "zero" rates to finance it, right? Then, after some 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of gold were leased around, I would control the equity of every player by controlling the lending interest rates. The above "lease rate spikes" can easily be created by withholding supply through open bidding for gold! It's a political sword that the BIS now holds over the paper shorts. All the market can do now is keep creating short paper by using "company equity" instead of gold. In time, the entire paper gold market drowns in "fictional" sales and becomes completely discredited as a true physical supply source. What a mess for them! What a success for real gold! thanks FOA

Your question of "which one has the deepest pockets ? Well it used to be that the one with the most gold made the rules and maybe it still does. Currently, it's the geopolitical group with the "world reserve currency" that holds the reins. However, this new open market for gold is about to award that title to a new entity.

Brief Musings I only have time for a couple of sentences.
1. The POG is not completely unimportant, even for hardcore physical gold buffs. Would one still feel the same about gold if it were valued at $10.00 per ounce, to use an extreme example?
2. The recent and continued price slide appears to me outside of the realm of the hypotheses of FOA/Another and must subject those hypotheses to further examination, to any person who seeks objective verification of hypotheses. Obviously, the BIS is not intervening to hold the POG
at $280.00. The POG has dropped more than a $5 to $6 fluctuation from about $283. Our friends are learned, and I eagerly look forward to their input on this, IMHO and respectful opinion, unpredicted weakness.
Thank You, canamami.

Hello canamami,
I know you posted again about this, but I wanted to comment. If you have kept up with the massive writing here, I hope you were able to grasp some of the other fine points made by all. In addition I add:
The range to purchase gold looks to be the same. Yes, it has dropped further (another 10 lower?), but as the shorts attempt to lower it, the physical market will, no doubt "discredit the paper market" through a large disparity in prices. Soon, one may not be able to purchase bullion
as the entire system begins to break down. At the point of breakdown, physical may not be available, except at much higher prices. The "risk" is becoming obvious and clear, worldwide! We shall see. Thanks, FOA

Hello Cassius,
I hope some of the recent posts added to your other stated considerations. As for the US anticipated actions? It's the only play available to them! They cannot sell their gold in quantity (see my other posts) and the current shorting is based on the "equity" of the local bullion traders, not the future supply of gold! That equity is at "major" risk as I write. The dollar "will" be devalued
with a rising world gold price and there is nothing the US political factions can do to stop it. As I said before, they will make as much political hay out of an inevitable situation as possible. In that light they may close the paper gold markets as they begin to fail from non delivery (a future event). Then begin a series of verbal prouncements about "how much gold the US has" and "how much backing it provides for the dollar". Remember, gold is no longer the threat, the Euro is! Thanks FOA

paper gold contracts
I am puzzled by the statement that there is an excess of paper gold "shorts" in the market. It is my opinion that you cannot just open a "short" position without an offsetting "long" position being created.
Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

tlc,
Hello, usually, the short side of a contract must (theoretically) supply real gold to complete the transaction. The long side must supply currency to complete. True, every position offsets. The problem arises from shorts not being able to supply gold because they don't have it. It's not that there are excess "shorts", rather no excess gold. does this help? FOA

FOA,
Is it your position that the BIS will not intervene to protect the POG at $280, or any level, given the existence of the Euro? How does this theory jibe with the Euro's declining value in relation to the $US? When did you arrive at the conclusion that the BIS will not, or no longer, ensure the POG stays above $280.00?

I look forward to your return, to hear your contributions to the discussion. Thank You, canamami.

Canamami,
They gain more leverage against the dollar with each new gold short written. I believe they decided to allow the market to "implode" when it became apparent that the US was going to encourage gold. This political decision came about around the time that Mr. R. quit. As I said earlier, they now hold a sword over the market that everyone should be aware of. It could fall at any moment and end any further purchases of gold at today's values.

I think the $280 price was based on an old formula they used long ago. I'll offer it later when I have more time. Also note that the Euro was never to rise against the dollar until the dollar fell from it's own weight. The Euro was to become the "fallback" reserve currency that received the
flight from a failing IMF / dollar system. The BIS / ECB was very surprise that it opened as strong as it did. Many who criticize the ECB for not supporting it are the same ones who object to the "dirty float" and "rigged" dollar. Yet, here the ECB is trying to offer a fair, self evaluating currency and the speculators are crying for "intervention"! No doubt the same ones that currently "intervene" in the paper gold markets to save their skins. We shall see. FOA

SteveH (6/5/99; 5:37:09MDT - Msg ID:7186)
SteveH and ALL:

Steve, I believe you are following a chain of thought that leads to many answers about this gold market. Most everyone agrees, even more so today, that this is a "new gold market". It truly is unlike anything seen sense the dollar went off the standard in 71. Analysts have often used
"technical interpretation", "supply and demand" or "price inflation changes" to explain it's past value trends. Yet, during these twenty some years, each of these "methodologies" have been shown to work only "part of the time". Truly, a thinking person can plainly see that the correlation between the dollar price of gold and the amount of "dollar currency inflation" is far out of line.
Some other factor is clearly at play, yet few will accept any "premise" that could, potentially, destroy their "present paper gold portfolio". Many investors talk about the terrible "gold - carry trade", "CBs leasing gold", "bullion banks shorting gold", "mines selling gold forward", and they want it all to stop so gold can return to it's proper commodity price structure! Yet, their perception is as such that all of this will end in a blaze of "short squeeze fire" with their own paper gold investments intact. Yes their personal "gold options", "comex gold futures", "mining stocks" and "gold certificates" will soar in value as this entire industry "practice" melts before the eyes of a disbelieving "wall street"!

This form of "gold investing logic" was born during the recent history that allowed for a super - expanding world dollar reserve to exist along with a gold market of "static value". As few as five years ago, no one questioned how the equity value of practically every world asset could be
expanded far beyond their economic worth without the gold value reflecting that "asset inflation". Lost in the reasoning was the "common sense" conclusion that only an "expanding currency base" could represent these asset values beyond practical, useful, economic purpose. So, many gold
bugs just shrugged off this "extended conflict" and said "someday people are going to recognize it and buy gold".

The lost fact in all of this was that "people were buying gold" on a massive worldwide scale and the dollar price was not reflecting it. Current "gold investing logic" says that cannot happen because "there is a buyer and a seller" for every commodity and the price quickly reflects it. This is true, except that only gold has been warehoused as money, to an extent far beyond it's commodity use (thank Mr. Parks of FAME for pointing this out to the WGC). It is here, that we confront the reason for "why gold has not kept pace" these past years. And why this new market is coming to the end of it's "era".

Steve, I again thank you for reposting my writing. In those posts it was offered how the overall gold market ownership was exploded during these years as every entity embraced the concept of lending gold. Truly, they all saw the money to be made for themselves, but did not fully question the "motive" behind lending gold for almost "no return" by the lenders. Most just accepted the public pronouncement that the "CBs were at war with gold" or that they were "obtaining a return on assets". I think any person, with a brain in their head knew that no one in this world lends anything for free (without a motive), so lets not discuss that one. Also true, some of the CBs are at war with gold, but only "some of them"!

The Euro / faction only appeared to be "at war" as some of them sold gold. However, one must look at the facts behind this, before reaching a conclusion. Haruko Fukuda, World Gold Council chief executive, pointed out on Friday that only two EURO CBs had sold gold, Belgium and Holland. I (FOA) know that those sales were done in private with the gold going into "friendly hands". It was the US / IMF faction that proclaimed to the world that "all of Europe was
selling off their gold reserves" with the purpose to "unmoney gold". Nothing could have been further from the truth. A quick look at statistics as given by the WGC offers:

""In fact the NET amount of sales from the official sector in the last 10 years was only 312 tonnes. Hardly a
landslide," she (Haruko Fukuda) said."

Steve, that is only an average of 31 tonnes a year hitting
the streets. This very fact negates the analysis of many "gold thinkers", in that they say the "CBs are filling the gold consumption deficit. The current deficit is being filled buy investors selling physical gold and holding paper gold. This was recently pointed out by myself, using Another's Thoughts from long ago. It was scoffed at then, now this logic is coming into view.

If one looks, clearly the most gold being sold onto the market is coming from entities that occupy the US / IMF sphere. Australia, Argentina and Canada to name a few. Yet, even these sales are consumed into this massive "new market" with only the small amount mentioned above set free. This same faction is also the one that is flooding the world with "gold paper" that has little behind it except the "currency equity" of the issuer. Their idea of a backed short sale is the holding of "OTC options". Many of the sales over the last few years were little more than "naked" shorts.
In this light it should be easy to see that the world paper gold market is "degenerating in quality", to a point of no return. Small investors are clearly "at risk" from an impending destruction of the current "paper mechanism" that sets the world price of gold. In much the same way the US
stopped the function of the COMEX silver market (in the 80s), because of inability to deliver silver. So will it shut down the gold market. Let's face facts, it was never intended to deliver gold, rather it's purpose was to "bet" on and manage the direction of gold's price! It's an old function, of this short history of gold that worked well as long as investors wanted to expand holdings using paper. But, all eras come to an end and so does this one.

The world wanted cheaper gold to replace dollar reserves. Some entities have taken advantage of this and invested in gold marked with a new "genealogy", that of the Euro and the BIS. Others will have to fight the war on a different front. I suspect that many "IMF / Faction" paper gold holders will be in the US courts for years trying to pursue what never existed, real gold. We shall see.

More likely than not, the BOE sales will mark the end of the road for this current gold market. While their decision appears "foolish" in public, Another knows that these actions are not taken lightly. The currency creators of other nations (Canada?) must also be "feeling foolish" as they stare into future national bankruptcy from price inflation. An inflation brought about from backing a failing dollar by selling their peoples gold to other CBs. The citizens find them to be "smart operators" as the appearance is that of earning interest as gold falls in price. Few understand, as do the treasury officials, that the lower price of gold comes from hollow paper selling. Nor will
they equate $200 oil to a lack of national gold. Later, many investors will grasp why physical gold purchased anywhere from $400 down was a fantastic chance of a "century in nature". Seldom does such a major change take place in ones lifetime.

I ask, what comes first in creating dollar value, "confidence in the dollar" as many think or "confidence in the ability of the dollar to settle contracts"? The history of paper currencies shows that citizens will continue to use even worthless currencies as long as they will settle old contracts. Find your books and research it for yourself. Then ask the question, "in the near future, will I be
holding paper contracts in need of settlement in dollars"? In this light, one can see why the real gold market is cornered, the physical market, that is. You see, oil and gold mix well in these new troubled times.

Michael,
Your post about the convoluted court "workout" of bankrupt mines is one for much consideration. In the event of mine assets being managed by a court trustee, I add: A massive increase in gold prices during this time would require the trustee to reopen the mine at a large profit, even during long drawn-out negotiations. Any new government taxes on such profits would require escrow for later payment "ahead of other players". Also, bullion bank claims would be
fully paid in gold (over a very, very long time) as the new economics of mining make such claims worthy to be satisfied. I do think the BBs will be fighting the government over any new taxes. Truly a mess. Please see below!

Please note that Mr. Faber suspects some CBs to buy back gold at a much higher price. I would add that they will use Euros to do this as that currency will be the "transactional" settlement medium for gold world wide. A price of $1,000 and higher will mark the end of the dollar as is presently known.

Also, his thoughts of "excessive profit taxes" are becoming a more common view as trends reverse. Again, I add that the "journey" from $280 gold to $1,000 gold "will" bring his massive increase in mine stock prices. The problem for most investors will be in timing the selling point. I
think, few will be able to sell their positions in the two or three days time required for gold to make this trip. Does anyone that thinks the shift from this era of gold price management into the era of paper gold "loss management" will bring a gentle price rise over months and years. If one
trades their position on that "premise", I think they will be holding these mine investments for much longer than anticipated. Any new tax legislation will be, no doubt, "grand fathered"! We shall see.

I apologize for not having the link to this story. Perhaps someone can provide it?

Dr Doom: gold, Murdoch, Soros

By Tony Boyd

Dr Marc Faber is the Hong Kong-based contrarian also known as Dr Doom. He writes a monthly newsletter called the Gloom, Boom and Doom report for 900 institutions and wealthy private individuals including some of Australia's better known multi-millionaires. Here he talks to Tony Boyd about his latest views.

On the gold price
Let's assume for one reason or another the psychology in the world changes in favour of an inflationary psychology
or for whatever reason people say they want to own gold.

With the world's population of 6 billion people, if each
person buys one gram of gold each worth about $13 that
would be about 6,000 tons of gold when there is an annual supply of 2,500 tons. The swing factor will be dramatic.

On gold and central banks I am prepared to bet with anyone in Australia that the central banks, which today are selling gold at less than $US300 an ounce, will go back and buy it at more than$US1,000 a ounce in a few years' time.

I am convinced it's going to be that way because I think
eventually the power will be taken away from the central
banks and the world will go back to some kind of financial system that has automatic built-in stabilisers.

The gold standard had some faults but the whole industrial revolution and the tremendous growth in the
world that occurred between 1800 and 1930 occurred under a gold standard, so you cannot dismiss the fact that the gold standard had some merits.

On a soaring gold price I think the gold price will go up so dramatically that governments will introduce excessive profit taxes on producers or, worse, expropriate them altogether.

If the gold price moves from say $US280 at the present
time to $US400, gold shares will go up by up to 200 per
cent, easily. So you have more leverage in gold shares, but if the gold price goes to more than $US1,000 then I would worry about excess profit taxes.

Beasting, thank you for thinking through my post #7188 (7186 was steveH). I have always found that the "masterful" mind belongs to the one that can understand what the writer has written! In this day of language "slang", offered in every country, reading has become the most difficult task.

SteveH, also thank you for your grade of "A". I believe everyone that follows USAGOLD will pass this class in good economic health (myself included). We live our lives to produce something of value to others. This is indeed the basis of world trade. However, "fair" trading requires
understanding of each other as much as mastering the knowledge of "the transaction". This forum exposes the true nature of that progress as we gain the knowledge understanding people as well as ourselves.

Also, I add this story to your evolution. "Have you ever talked to someone that said the sun would rise in the east and then the world would end? When asked if they could explain? The reply was, I don't know the mechanics of rising suns. I'll leave that to the experts. But truly, this

In the U.S. there is currently demand for certain skilled occupations;Doctors,nurses top athletes. These occupations can very easily legally work in the U.S.(with proper immigration papers) demanding and receiving higher wages than they may get in their respective home countries.Hence, a higher standard of living for themselves and their families.
Now, my point is,wages may not vary from country to country(as they do now)with the use of a single currency(Euro),in the long term,when workers are payed in Euro's only.FOA do you agree with this?

Let me put this thought in perspective for our North American friends. Example: A Canadian,or Mexican loses considerable purchasing power when exchanging their
Peso's or Dollars for U.S.currency when traveling to the U.S. In my humble opinion if North America and other Latin American Countries ever went to the all U.S. dollar system (similar to what the Euro Countries are doing) after a long time would an equilibrium be established?

beesting,
I see your point, and it is a good one. Yes, wages will tend to converge and compensate equally for each form of production and skill. However, this will only work if the money creation is under one "many government" roof, such as the Euro zone. Many point out that this is a weakness of this new currency and will pull the union apart. I disagree and state that it will become it's strength.

Prior to EMU, each country changed it's exchange intervention policy to the benefit of local workers, usually providing a loss to it's currency. At least that was the overriding game plain. Now, the currency will retain the favorable attribute of "management" with the control of "diverse government needs" and lose the baggage of "maintaining mismatched skill compensation". Yes,
some citizens will be shocked to learn that their "better pay" was the result of currency intervention, not their special standing in life. It will promote a bitter struggle over time. But, it will result in far lower inflation rates in the member countries where citizens had no strong currency.

In contrast, this dynamic is far different from your example of Mexico converting to dollar use. They will have no "usable opinion" in the money policy of the US and yet still retain a lower living standard. As an example, Kansas as an independent country? All labor and resources would be
exploited from that state for the benefit of the rest of the US.

Also, note that the dollar is well past the point of management. It's timeline has come to an end as it's debt has rendered it into a "collection only" currency. For it to regain any balanced reserve use, worldwide, it's base would have to be contracted many times over. A loss to US citizens that will never be allowed. Again, this is the very attribute that so drives the quest for Euro success. In
time I would expect many other countries to join the EMU and convert to exclusive Euro use.

The gold of Arabia has made this path, for them, a very level one, indeed. The coming free market in gold will, not only judge all currencies and nations for the entry status, but create a fair way to value their contribution to world trade. We shall see.

Please continue your consideration. FOA

Question to FOA
-----------Where in your opinion will Aragorn III's "Thunder in the night" occur ? --- Now we watch the Spot gold start out the week "Downunder" and move to HK before reaching London and ending in the US. -- Do you await the BoE, bailout of the Brittish BB's before the blastoff in the price of Au ? -- OR will the cause be from another tightning of the OPEC taps before the Y2K effect sets in ? -- Let us hear your pronostications on the timing of this event. Thanks for everything you have pointed the Goldhearts toward, and we shall all meet you sometime at the future world gold trading site in the East. ;-)-------------------

Hello Gandalf the White,
If we listen closely, I think Mr. Aragorn III's "Thunder in the night" may have just begun with a quiet statement. As USAGOLD and TownCrier pointed out today, the BIS is talking.

"General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Andrew Crockett said today that despite sales of gold reserves by central banks, gold would continue to play a major role in the reserves of central banks.
He said that since most central bankers seemed not to want to sell much more of their gold soon, he did not expect the price of gold to fall much further."

I suspect this statement is the beginning of a "threat of action". The WGC knows that (GW, read my last few posts) only two Euro CBs sold gold for "reserve alignment" prior to EMU. No public accounting was ever made as to the placement of that gold. It is no longer on the books, but did it remains in Euro friendly hands? Now consider all of the writing that analyst and officials have offered over these last few years, that Europe was unloading gold! Yet, after untold physical sales and paper shorts by dollar / IMF factions, the BIS states "gold would CONTINUE to play a MAJOR ROLE in the RESERVES of central banks"! I ask you, what Central Banks could they be referring to? Does the ESMB (Euro System Member Banks) come to mind?

Does this statement, "He said that since most central bankers seemed not to want to sell much more of their gold soon, he did not expect the price of gold to fall much further." really mean, if the dollar / IMF wants gold lower in price, they will have to sell gold (not paper)??? And, if they don't / can't sell any more real gold, the paper price will fall no further?

Further, as I have stated before, the current paper short position only has "credibility" if gold falls further in price. Otherwise, the paper is worthless as no gold can be delivered against it. Also, with the G-8 meeting about "derivatives" about to open the shorts books for viewing, this gold era is about to close! Watch Comex OI these next few weeks!

GW, the timetable will be as long as it takes for the next chess player to make their move. Not long, I think! FOA

"Thinking Through The Thoughts"
http://www.smh.com.au/news/9906/19/national/national4.html
ALL,
I had considered writing many letters (posts) to address each of the different questions / concepts posed on this forum. This was as a similar process that Another used to get readers to view and analysis events in a different light, using their own concepts. However, this subject is
now much to large and all consuming for brief points of comment. We have reached a time when "everyone" has seen the obvious management of gold prices and accepts this as fact. Only a few years ago, most investors considered the gold market as a "somewhat free" supply / demand situation and invested using that premise. As Another pointed out that "events" would prove all things so do we witness the evolution of investor logic into the realm of "reality"!


Gold: Saving Real Money In A Time Of Transition

I am going to offer a series of posts (chapters) starting at the "beginning". We will use simple logic and common terms to explain "what has happened" along this "journey through time". Another will edit it for direction (as he has this post). This will be a long process, and I hope it will
offer a real value for "thoughtful minds". As many are now starting to discover that most of the Western ideas of gold investment were flawed from the beginning, so to will they find their present (gold) portfolios "unprepared" for the storm that approaches! With that I leave you with a portion
from the "Sydney Morning Herald" and a quote from Another.


---------Miners and prospectors at the historic town of Kalgoorlie, 550 kilometres east of Perth, said big operators were sacking staff and marginal mines were facing closure as gold plummeted to around $US260 ($400) an ounce.
One high-profile prospector, Mark Creasey, said this week that although Australia's$5 billion gold industry had experienced periods of economic gloom in the past, this was its darkest day. "It is the quality of the gloom that makes
the difference: pitch-black and horrible. This is the worst downturn I have ever seen."------------

Gold: Saving Real Money In A Time Of Transition
Introduction

------ A gentleman leans over the fence and tells his neighbor that gold is going to rise in price from it's current $300. As the person on the other side of the fence thinks differently, they both agree to a binding bet. In three months, we will settle up with a payment of the change in the price of one hundred ounces of gold. Whatever it rises, the "bull" collects that amount. Likewise,
whatever it falls, the "bear" collects from the bull. Each puts a $1500 payment guarantee into a common shoe box and gives it to another neighbor for safekeeping. ---------

As an observer of the above, we have just witnessed the creation of a wager not unlike a comex futures contract. On each side of the fence stands a long and a short, that together create an open interest of one contract. Neither has any intention of buying gold, nor do they expect
physical gold to be a part of this bet. Yet, at cocktail parties and on public internet forums, one claims to have "brought gold" and the other states that he "sold gold".

To build a further understanding of this transaction: Both of these gentlemen, probably don't have the $30,000+/- to buy or deliver 100 ounces of gold. Human nature being as it is, if they did have that much, they would most likely increase the bet to ten or twenty contracts. Clearly, the
intent of this paper market, is to bet on the price of gold as it is determined by the buying and selling of other physical traders. The western public should take these trades for the concept they truly represent. ""I (the long side) bet on the "price" of gold not because we need or want the physical metal. Rather, my wager is that others will need real gold to protect themselves from bad monetary systems. In fulfilling that "need to own", these others will drive up the dollar price and I will make money while working within the confines of our good monetary system.""" The shorts make the opposite bet, in that they think the world monetary system will work itself out and induce "the others" to sell all their gold. That is, gold they brought in the first place, because they did not know that our money managers could repair the world financial system.

Yes, today Western longs and shorts are playing out these two views of the gold market. Yet, both sides are using paper gold bets to represent their beliefs. Truly, the major majority of this market does not buy or sell physical gold to represent their investment concepts. There are a few
that buy coins and bullion, but, even in their large amounts, it is only a drop in the paper gold bucket.

This, my friends, is the very nature of western trading of gold. The mindset is to treat it as a concept for making currency, not protecting existing wealth. The exact same mentality exists when one invests in the gold mining industry. Even when these players see the faults in the dollar, and loudly proclaim it's inflationary downfall, the largest part of their assets go into the business of
producing real gold in exchange for more of the same paper currency. It is a means to build wealth through paper asset appreciation, using the very financial system the "concept" says will fail without physical gold.

There are many mental angles and philosophical side steps one can take when understanding the above. But, in this concept lies the very basis of the flaw in the current gold market. A paper market, built upon world misconceptions of currency values and the historical reasons for owning
gold. The present deployment of world assets into a paper system of valuations is liken to traveling a trail of no return. History has shown that the assets accumulated in this way will never be transformed into "the things of life"! The paper wealth you currently own is no where near the real value your currency says it is. With the above introduction, we have begun close to the end of this journey. In the upcoming chapter one, we return several miles to walk ground already well traveled. We will observe concepts on the right and the left, not discussed by other guides. The very sights that make such a trip, "worth wile".

out, did you think the London gold market would just sit there and allow the paper price to soar and wipe them out? No, the world gold market as we know it will be completely dishonored from inability to deliver. But only after they have flooded the system with worthless short securities.

In our introduction, we witnessed two friends with a fence between them. Neighbors, betting on the "price direction" of gold. Not it's future impact on their daily lives or the use of gold as money, but rather how much currency would other people use to buy gold at any given time. Contrast that perspective to our concept of gold and you will see that a wide gulf of understanding stands between our "minds from different worlds".

-------- "They never said it wasn't money! Only, that they could no longer use it as money for their purposes" ------

The author of that statement is unknown, but it was spoken sometime after the "Smithsonian Agreement" of the early 70s finally closed the door on using gold as part of the world monetary system. The old Bretton Woods articles were then officially dead and the dollar would no longer
be a "contract currency" for the delivery of gold. Shortly after this event, banks, governments and large investment entities still agreed that gold was real money, but it should be held only in reserve. So, instead of using the dollar as a contract for gold, the world would substitute it as real gold in the currency system and thus sent it down the road of being "demoneyized".

From the 1920s to the 1970s (with striking similarities to today), gold loans between private and official sectors had periodically become so great that they simply couldn't be paid. The world economy was being built upon a debt of gold that no one could pay off.

Early on, it was agreed that because the repayment of loans in real money would break the banks, payments in newly created real money substitutes would suffice as gold. Over time, the reaction to this concept was easy to understand. Every thinking person knew that creating more (inflating) paper currency to cover existing debts would lead to devaluation's of such fiat currency. Therefore, we will all hold gold in reserve, while these bankrupt deals are worked out with fraudulent money payments. Money that was no longer "contract currency". Later, gold will be revalued upward to balance these newly created money substitutes. In time, all world currencies would finally be officially devalued against gold. That, my friends is why so many investors
continued to buy and hold gold as a long term savings asset throughout the 1970s. It was perceived that the world would eventually return to using gold as the money for payment of debt, instead of using paper money substitutes.

This perception was extremely prudent because history had proven, through the actions of countless generations that creating paper money to save governments and banks from bankruptcy eventually destroys the "concept" of using created money for currency. No one ever expected the general populous to continue using and saving "non contract dollars" for any extended period of time. Mostly, everyone expected the citizens to patriotically continue to use the "new inflated paper legal tender" as asset savings until price inflation exposed that they were sharing their life savings with the state. A process that would require five years at most. Never the ten to fifteen years that have passed. In the end, it made little difference how long it took, as the
adjustment in value always compensated for the inflation plus interest. The only investors that didn't think gold would outlast this new system, were the ones with a "short life of little history experience".

Again, from the failure of Bretton Woods to this present day, there is an ongoing event being further played out from the early twenties. By now (2000) the world can no longer use gold as money because to do so would require virtually every debt to fail. But, what is never considered is that a fiat currency system always "fails" the debts anyway. When the price inflation begins, old currency debts lose value at the same rate as the inflation. A history lesson soon to be performed today right before our eyes. We have but to watch and learn!

But, why do we nowhere read that it would be OK for these banks and businesses to fail, thereby allowing others to buy them up for pennies and save the system? Truly, this was the same real problem with the use of honest gold money as it forces "the important" people to fail. People of influence and prestige. Persons that will not allow their debt assets to fail, even if they gain only a few years. For them the world cannot function without an "expandable monetary system"! An ages old scam that is presented to each new generation as a new and improved currency system.
Custom tailored for their own technological advances and special time in world History. A special system that wil force the average worker to "share" in the loses but still retain this new generations wealth! With this system, any government can then borrow or print money to inflate (expand) the money system so as to bail out failing businesses and foreign entities. Does this sound like the
present IMF?

Yes, gold was our money back then (pre- 1920s). But, the bad business debts and wars of the world had "used up" much of those gold savings. Over time, the savings stock of much of the gold that every citizen, business, government and bank had, was borrowed to finance expenditures. It is imperative to understand that using the expression "gold used up" meant that it was "lent out"!

Of course, back then, even if gold is "lent out" it went somewhere, and from that new savings account (somewhere)it can be borrowed again. However, if the world financial strains become great enough, failing governments and businesses could not borrow gold at all. Therein lies the solid law of real money that scares governments today. We must totally fail and start again.

"It is to say, the gold you thought be in your bank, was not. In your account, the real money was lent and the credit claim represents your wealth" Another

It was here, in the 20s 30s 40s, in that context of time, that we witness the harsh reality that wars and governments are financed by borrowing real savings assets and spending them. When gold is used as money, it effectively demonstrates the real risks in lending ones life savings. That being: you may not get your money back. Is it any wonder that many families decide not to lend their savings? A compelling truth, that allows one to separate their money from the state and not share in the loses of others. In this light we confront the real issue of why so many governments always move from using gold as money, to using fiat currencies as money. It enables them to force you to lend!

During the time (1930s) that the American government called in gold from it's citizens, it would have been very simple for the US treasury to revalue gold upwards into the $300 +/- range (from the low twenties). Yes, many major financial players would have fallen from this dollar
devaluation. In addition, America would have lost much international prestige. However, the real productive assets of this great country would have been kept, "intact"! Those assets were much of the private savings of working people, and most of it was in gold, in their hands. Again, in that
time, it was the only money not lent out. This unprecedented action of devaluing the dollar would have clearly identified the loses from wars and poor lending decisions. It would have forced the large wealth holders and governments to lose assets in proportion to their size. As it was, the small citizens were forced to share in balancing the destroyed assets by turning in unlent gold.

History has shown that "some great leaders" have taken the honest gold "deflation" route when they are not under the influence of "money lenders". In these situations, the context of deflation is not the destruction of the money supply, which was gold, rather it was the destruction of the debt securities held as assets. Assets, due to be paid in gold, and cannot! Deflation, in these terms is a far different animal than what is discussed today! In our time, all currency assets are debt securities. That is why any form of price deflation or price inflation, today, will destroy the entire world monetary system. Forcing people back into using real gold, the only money that cannot be
deflated!

"It is the clear view for an honest eye, yes?" Another

The Bretton Woods system was bound to fail because the world governments continued to pursue a a strategy of saving the integrity of all debts. Even while holding an international pledge to use the dollar as a "contract currency" for gold as money. After the US had robbed it's citizens in the 1930s (of gold money) to help balance the books, the stage was clearly set to proceed into currency inflation. They continued to print "dollar currency contracts" as the dollar was a legal contract to deliver 1/35 of an ounce of gold. They did this knowing full well that this process would further demoneyize the dollar. The final destruction of Bretton Woods was but a further step to no longer using gold as money: not using gold because it's use required debts to fail. If the debts are "to never" go away, the currency substitutes must be continuously nflated. Thus, the savings of workers must be diluted in order to always save the system from default. As long as the next generation believes that their money assets are growing, they will accept the currency and the fraud it represents. The price inflation (that history shows will always follow this process), is totally dependent on how many currency units the citizens will hold without spending them! If the
world population can hold one trillion dollar debt units, and ten years later hold ten trillion without spending them, then no price inflation will show. However, even though each person thinks they have ten times more assets ( and are as much more wealthy), that wealth is quickly degraded if and when such currency savings are exchanged for real goods. Again, history shows that only the spending of a small percent of such highly inflated currency holdings will quickly jump the price of things to such a level as to revalue the remaining existing currency. It then becomes equal to real world buying power, not the fiction in your savings account. This, my friends is the realm of price
inflation and currency destruction! No currency has survived even a short time, once this spending process begins from the money inflation levels that exist today.


Now you have read some many views of the old dollar and gold. We will discuss these much further in other chapters. So, how do we (myself and Another) view gold?

I want to openly state that we have absolutely "NO" faith in gold! None! We do have "absolute", "unending" and "complete" faith in the judgment of our fellow humans. Because we travel this life journey as a society of like kind, our success over time depends on the ability of
people to deal fairly with each other. There is nothing to gain in this life but the honest productive efforts we bestow upon each other. These are represented as the goods and services each of our special talents can produce. We also believe that no one, in this life, should be cheated out of any portion of their savings and will act to protect themselves from loses. This act of protection can and does take many forms as the "lessons of a long life" become the "tools of a families defense". For most of us, indeed, money is "the" lifelong lesson.

I believe, that in the time just ahead, most people will use their natural good judgment and leave the "world monetary system". Mostly because they will begin to lose savings from price inflation. If the history of human kind is any guide, they will return to the safety of the past. They will use the only "conservative money" the world has ever known that cannot be deflated or inflated They will do this until the currencies are correctly revalued against gold. Gold will then become the de facto world money as currency will be used only for commerce and trade. It's
value in trade closely governed by it's exchange rate into gold.

To this end, we do not hold gold for any currency return. We hold it as money. No return of any kind is expected because it is not lent or invested. What is expected is a continuation of an open world market for the purchase of gold at lower paper substitute exchange rates. These values of world currencies, as expressed in gold will be governed by the "tolerance" of world savers to hold ever increasing amounts of paper currency as savings. In addition, the ability of governments to keep the market open with physical gold at lower prices are necessary for the
continued use of the present currency system.

It is our current perception that the performance of both of these functions is coming to an end as the dollar currency creation process has ended. As this progresses, the value of gold will be best judged by it's ability to purchase real things. Out of necessity, the failing paper market place presently called the "gold market", will price gold at ever lower values even as their ability to deliver gold is failing. This situation is not unlike the massive gold loans of years past. Using dollar "contract currency" as a proxy for gold, the world found out that the promise to pay at even $41=/- per ounce was a fraud! We shall see.


In chapter ((2)) we will build upon the workings of the gold market as it represents oil, the most strategic world commodity. Thank You FOA and Another

Reply to: USAGOLD (7/10/99; 19:35:16MDT - Msg ID:8634)
Mr. Kosares,
The time from our thoughts has been long as your Forum does well for all. As you ask, then Intellectual our conversation will be.

In reply to your post I add. The sands have indeed moved a considerable distance, and we should not seek to survey it's new location. For it seems the same grains of sand, like gold, can have many owners at the same time. Better to stand your face to the wind and prepare for the next storm. It may be many seasons before the fury comes this strong again.

I suspect that many are unprepared for this gold market. They write in many places about it's falling dollar price. A common conviction all share that the dollar price will one day explode. True this be as the sun will rise. Yet, blind in one eye are they! For all paper gold will burn first
from a "destroyed world market"! First it be destroyed from a fabricated low price. Contrary are their paper portfolios to this wisdom of ages. Gold bulls, fully invested in securities that must have the higher currency price to return profit, even as history proclaims the dollar war that attempts to bring gold to zero. Say they, "All paper gold will burn, just not my paper, yes?"

The dollar, once the "contract currency" for gold at $35. Even the fool did know that $35 could not be right! Yet that paper market was accepted around the world as the true value and price for physical gold. Gold loans were outstanding for millions and millions of ounces from the
US treasury to foreign treasuries. Non payable then as they are non payable today. The dollars Europeans held were as the same as the leased contracts we see now. Part of the financial landscape that provides liquidity, liquidity that saves the system. Never to be paid, but still accepted, then and now! The trading of old dollars represented the low gold price that closed mines and broke markets, yet the fraud did continue for some time.

Today, the gold sand blows from Central Bank to Central Bank, and is loaned many times. It has become the "fractional reserve" currency that we dare not speak of, but have it we must. The BIS and the ECB now hold the London market in the palm of their hand. And this old British
market holds the fate of the dollar in it's hand. Truly, if no fraction of Euro gold is forthcoming as reserves for the Bullion Bank market, then it will become as only a "wager" arena.

As the old dollar was once a "contract currency" that everyone accepted as creating the $35 price of gold, we soon found that value was a fraud. Today, it is gold that has created the value for the dollar. A value to be lost as this currency is put to rest in the pages of history.

At all costs, England will save all of their houses possible, before the Gold market is destroyed. We may see gold at "any dollar" price. Every entity in the world that trades gold, will have some loses from "non delivery" as this work is done. Some major gold mines may see their shares at "0" before this is completed. Physical gold will become "almost impossible" to obtain on your "legal"
market. I suspect, that the "legal" trading of gold on the Euro market will find the dollar buying 1/
10,000 of an ounce (or less), in time.

Yes, my friend, this "lost land" does hold much control of the currency price of gold, because the currency price of gold will now have no influence with the House of Europe. I believe oil wealth is leaving the Pound for the Euro. If oil do not join the EMS soon, they will suffer. If England stays with the dollar, they will fail.

My words to you,

Good sense of humor.

Re: your leasing post. Generally, I agree. I think when making a point about dangers of gold-leasing, the part about gold-property leasing for mineral rights, although, valid, is not poignant. It has relevance to gold-mining operators but not MA and PA. Now, your gold leasing explanation itself was on the mark. I would have to re-read it, but I did see a point about Comex not having to deliver. It is my understanding that deliveries occur every day and in fact they are being made. The problem with a COMEX delivery is it takes a while. To my knowledge they don't give a hard time about it other than make you wait a bit (I have heard six months). So although it can be used as a delivery method, it is not efficient.

Secondly, the Central Banks (as a rule) act as a guarantor who backs up a Bullion Bank with a promise to make good on their gold loans. A bullion bank only need make sure they can deliver if they have to, but they will get gold from the market or another bullion bank. By obtaining the backing of the CB, the bullion bank is free to make trades with more gold. Since much of it is for hedging from mines, and the mine is the source of most deliverable gold, with the CB guarantee, the bullion bank can use mines as a source of gold but not more than the production amount. It appears to be the period of time that is being relied upon from the mines by the BB's -- up to 10 years of production is now hedged. Now here is what I think has gone wrong. The mine sold forward up to 10-year production. This allows the BB to sell out gold in the amount of 10-years production. It is back by the CB. Since most of this gold is used in derivatives and counter-party risk, physical delivery wasn't an issue until recently, as a BB could borrow from Peter BB to pay Paul BB. Now the demand for physical is increasing, as more and more dealers and brokers, and countries are taking delivery. Since the only gold available is in a CB or the production of a mine, the more physical gold is demanded to satisfy any futures contract or gold deal option or derivative or demand, the fewer places gold can be had. Some of these BB's are rolling over their contract in hopes of not having to deliver or ever having to deliver.

Add to this, the thought that certain Mid Eastern countries are buying up these contracts for repayment of mining company gold in gold. As the production is mined the country(ies) then receive the gold. In return for receiving the gold, they funded the BB with oil money. But now that physical demand is increasing, I think some of these countries are concerned that others may make a claim to the physical gold from the mines. I believe that this concern has prompted a country(ies) to ask for settlement of some payments in gold (as a show of faith that the gold will still be delivered). It must be the country(ies) didn't want to wait six or more months, nor to affect the price of spot, so they went after the BB to get the gold, who in turn went to the Bank of England and said, "We's got to deliver 25 tons of gold, you said you'd back us, that's why we pay you the money, now we are in danger of defaulting here, help us out, ok? Please?" The BOE probably figures that the ripple effect of these one or more BB's not being able to deliver will cause a lack of confidence in the paper gold markets, so they are obliged to deliver in a way to not force further demand of gold, thus the dutch auction method and the secrecy and the limited subscribership. If they admitted that the reason they sold their gold was to prevent a BB from not delivering on a gold demand, the world would know that gold is in short supply. This would further increase demand for physical delivery. Since it would take 10 years to deliver some of the gold, the price would be forced higher thus spiraling out of control.

In essence the BOE move to auction gold bought time, keeps the dollar at its position of strength and the pound too. I believe the theory of CBs must be that if we can keep the dollar strong, gold down, and let it be known that leasing needs to stop, then they may be able to unwind some of the positions and turn things around. My fear, and I believe most peoples fear, is that it can't be unwound without major harm to bank and market. As a crashing market and skyrocketing gold price are politically unfavorable, I believe the stalling game is in place.

I believe some of the CB folks are well-intentioned and are using what leverage they have to hold it together, but as you can see by ORO's post earlier that this is becoming increasingly more difficult.

Since, as I have previously stated, their is a Money clash between the Euro and the Dollar for reserve status, the trump card to be played in all of this (and here is what Another and Friend of Another (FOA) come in) is the following: A/FOA claim the Euro will become the payment media for oil. It seems that even as we speak, this is coming closer to reality, because NOT ENOUGH GOLD exists from the mines and the CENTRAL BANKS don't want to let it go. So, the only other alternative aside from accepting dollars to settle the gold debt is to settle in Euros. Check.

Gold and the Euro, that is where it seems to be heading. Since we are but bystanders all we see are the arms and legs in the fighting dust ball. We don't actually get to see the gory infighting and negotiations. Problem is the tickets to this fight have been free to the Consumer (a gift in the form of a rising stock market) because goldbugs paid for their tickets with their money). Yes, the gold lending, hedging, and derivative market money made its way into a behemoth stock and bond market, which has been our prosperity for the last four or five years. Throw in a twist of yen-carry trade, which was much of the same with the YEN as it was with gold, and you can see why we have a stock bubble and a beat up gold market.

SO, HERE IS THE BIG CONCLUSION: BOE AND IMF GOLD ARE DESTINED TO BAIL OUT BULLION BANKS TO MAKE GOOD ON GOLD DELIVERY CONTRACTS TO OIL COUNTRIES BECAUSE ENOUGH GOLD DOESN’T EXIST OTHER THAN IN CENTRAL BANKS WHO DON’T WANT TO LET IT GOLD. NO BOE GOLD SALES; NO IMF GOLD SALES, EURO WINS. CHECKMATE.
Euro was introduced with 15% in gold reserves.

Mr. jinx44,
In your post, we should consider using a much higher currency price for gold. If it does become necessary to demand a gold based evaluation for oil payments, the number of gram per barrel would be very small. Remember, the purpose is not to control the commodity use of gold,
rather it is to implement the monetary usage of real money. In the real world, all money does circulate to buy things and does not stagnate in accounts to monopolize value. The flow of gold in this new era would truly occur in a free market. A new market provided by the demand for oil!

Not a new concept, my friend, only a new evaluation of the worth of domestic currencies as reflected in real things. Even today, gold does participate beside the currencies as money. However, today it's price as a money continues to reflect the need to "prop up" currency values
already lost to debt deflation. A process that was expected and ongoing. The final destruction of the "reserve dollar" will not initially be shown as an extreme dollar price for gold. Understand that the real dollar implosion will be manifest in it's inability to honor "gold contracts" and "gold loans". Just as did happen to the "contract currency" this dollar once was. It only failed when it could no
longer honor the $35 contract to deliver. The present reserve currency is not "backed" by gold as it may not default twice. However, the "fractional liquidity" of gold has created the assets, as "gold loan" paper assets "marked to the market" do provide backing. Backing needed to balance the financial books. The breaking of a "contract currency" in the 70s was but a bookkeeping entry, where this new default will be of real terms. Such will be today as all forms of "gold commerce" as denominated in dollars is put to fire. It is, "the" very reason nations of resource wealth do not invest in "gold in the ground". Our wealth is already under the earth, in liquid form (real and financial meaning)! Gold above the ground is the real money for the future.

Why will gold paper be honored for special resources?

Mr. Canamami,
I do ask, what in this life can be proven for you? Does one not fall asleep for fear of awakening into a new day of unknown? Without proof, a new day may not arrive.

Many expected outcomes are born from the understanding of social interactions. If the king declares all thieves are to be executed, one does understand that death is to befall an apprehended pickpocket. It is the unproved, but "expected" result, yes?

Such is the case as one evaluates the world political game. A game we play with many kings. I place my wealth with respect to the past actions and present thoughts of current rulers. Seldom does one have the luxury of experiencing the actions of leaders, prior to the events that trigger said response! I would bow low before such knowledge!

Truly, $280 was an inflection point that would, indeed, have ended this present currency system as it is known. An action to have been taken, in another time and place, for a
predetermined event. Without the birth of the Euro?, as the expected action, "the purchase would have been done". For yourself, at that moment, it would have been proven. Yet, perhaps unprepared were many for such an outcome.

The "currency war" of Mr. SteveH? The lines are clearly drawn, the troops deployed and smoke in the field, but no proof is seen by many? As said before, I suspect most of the western gold investors are not of a portfolio position to weather this storm. They need evidence that this plunge in dollar gold price marks the end of this currency as has been known.

Your World Gold Council openly presents that over the last ten years only some 300 tons (net) of gold are sold from the Central Banks. That is 30 tons (average) per year, my friend. Yet everywhere, I see posters such as Mr. H. proclaim how these banks are filling the public deficit for physical gold. World investors accept the paper liquidity this gold does offer. Yet, fail to understand that this new gold is owed to someone at a price that can never be delivered against.

Sometimes proof comes as mountain air, so clear and clean it cannot be real!

Mr. Jinx44,
It would require only one large producer to demand a small amount of gold as payment. Even the smallest of payments would introduce gold as a functioning currency. Every other seller of oil would then ask for this payment method, as a higher price it would present. The draw upon
physical gold supplies would be very little, as the intent is to "transition" gold into said "functioning money".

At present, gold is used as an "asset currency", for the addition of liquidity. A process that builds upon the dollar use in trade. It is (and has been for some time), as you say, "the one way street of no return". Always lower gold for lower oil to build economy. With the Euro intact,
Europe does no longer need lower gold, as oil will join the EMU in fact or in practice from the use of their currency in settlement. With said intentions, no longer do the ECB lend gold.

It is now the obvious change of position, as oil prices do rise as gold falls. The falling gold price no longer represents the past intent of payment for oil. Today, the dollar world does war against gold without offering much real metal. It seems they do reach the end of this "one way street". The only outcome can be the destruction of the dollar gold market thru a "low price with no delivery".
Truly the BIS/ECB will stand ready to create the new "Euro Bullion Market Association" (EBMA). The present rising price of oil, so soon after the EMU does indicate this new
expectation.

Would be very interested in your response to Mr. I.V. Holtzman's 3 posts yesterday 7/16/99--msg. #8986--msg. #8987 and msg. #8988. He makes many valid points, that seem to
be the majority view, here in the western world. Thank You......beesting

Beesting,
Mr. Holtzman does indeed hold the secure western view. His support is found in the history of the dollar, as it's short life applies to ones assets. His last paragraph:

"The next few months, and probably the next few years, are going to be horribly demoralizing for gold bugs. But don't panic and sell at the bottom. Hold onto at least some of what you already own, if for no other reason than that selling it all now is exactly what "they" want you to do. And hold shares in the big gold mining stocks as well as holding coins. True, if Another proves right, the shares will be worthless and the coins will shoot for the stars. However, if Gordon Brown proves right, the coins will be permanently halved in value but the stocks will more than
compensate for that. Someone who owns both will have a small chance of watching both soar, a decent chance of having one soar more than the other falls, and a small chance of watching both fall. That's why you should own non-gold assets, too. Remember, the best revenge is to be
diversified enough so that only a small part of your wealth is having a bad year."

------
I submit that every thing upon this earth is the potential "asset" of an individual. Social order requires the diversification of ownership and use of these "assets" to promote a reasonable life thru trade and commerce. The interaction of this commerce requires "honest money" with a
"proven" history of "use" that allows for a true valuation in trade.

When an individual offers that he is "diversified" in holdings for the purpose of only some of it having a bad year, I agree. However, I ask, how will you assess your assets when the currency is changed? History has shown that society destroys government paper currencies when the debts
denominated in them can on longer be paid with honest daily work.
In this light, a bad year comes from owning assets that derived a high value solely from their association with the currency. This is evident in the wealth of most of the western world.

It is to say, your wealth is not as much as your currency say it is! Another

Mr. SteveH,
Your words: "gold up -- gold stocks up -- sell gold stocks -- get dollars -- pay off mortgage, cars, credit cards and put kid through college, and buy gold at 10K per ounce."


FOA did demonstrate in his "book of Posts" how two neighbors bet on gold. In addition, I add, one must make the bet on the survival of the dollar first, before investing in the gold industry.

The perception of most have been wrong about the dollar price of gold. All increases in price from the 70s thru today, were the result of "foreign" holders of dollars bidding for gold. IMF / Dollar nations did only supply gold at ever higher prices. A process that quickly stopped the
bidding before it became "out of hand". In such environment, investors projected this action as "normal" gold response to inflation. Modern analysts did now considered that gold "the
commodity", today, has the "natural worth of $400 to $500. To this day, all (westerners) invest in gold industry and wait for this "natural trend" and "tendency" to reassert itself. A poor conclusion that has lost the wealth of many.

Some also expected (correctly) that the dollar destruction would bring explosion in gold price. What was not understood in this perception, was that entire world gold market is based upon dollar system and the liquidity it provided. The destruction of this reserve currency would first bring the total loss of confidence in the dollar pricing of gold. The "setup" of a run by official Central Banks from dollar reserves would be preceded by total "non support" of the London Gold Arena". In such a process the paper price of gold could go to $10. Yet delivery would be
the "joke on the holder" of such paper. Just as the old dollar "contract currency" of Bretton Woods was also "joke on holder". However, today, most gold paper holders are "Western in nature". History in reverse, yes?

There is enough gold in world market to supply some coins. Even some paper is delivered to, if asked. If BOE, IMF and Swiss supply, some Bullion Banks will be only partially "made whole". How long will paper holders stand with "gold loans" as the new "contract currency"? I suspect a further increase in oil price will demand delivery of gold.

My friend, do you expect the mining industry to continue in business when they have a world market for gold at, perhaps $100? If London Bullion Houses cannot deliver to total conversion of paper to gold, would not their world market price, a paper price, be discounted to said $100 or
less? Just as a bond is discounted from "par" as it ability to pay is questioned, so do we witness the falling price of paper gold. The same world paper price that every mining house must sell into. A perception many have not known, yes?

The price of gold to me is an exchange rate between currencies. The dollars I hold are worth more as the exchange rate falls against gold. It does balance against the "perceived" less value of gold already owned. The difference between you and myself, is that I feel the dollar will soon have no rate of exchange with gold.

As one sold old Russian debt into a rising market, so do I sell dollars into gold. Like the dollar reserve of old, the Russian debt is no more!

Thank You

Another,

You provide much food for thought.

Here is a summary of your point as I view them:

Dollar/IMF/BOE digging a hole by staving inevitable inability to deliver against paper gold contracts at world future exchanges.

Most Western countries, led by the BOE, the Swiss, and perhaps the IMF and its represented countries, are the ones entrenched in paper gold leasing and loans. These will be defaulted, but not before driving the price of paper gold to possibly $10-$100 per ounce.

As paper price declines against dollar, physical gold demand will increase even more at lower and lower prices until it is apparent that no physical gold can or will be delivered at such ludicrous prices.

Then, the dollar will be discredited (as will the British pound), as it no longer can be used to buy gold: no one will accept it.

Gold mining stocks and perhaps even silver stocks traded in dollars will flounder because their perceived values will follow the price of gold downwards, such that they will be had for pennies on the dollar (an occurrence that is now in progress mind you).

The EMU is prepared to step in to offer a true and fair-priced market in gold in Euros, which will launch the Euro as the world Reserve Currency, forcing the US to convert its dollars to Euros at an increasing exchange rate, thereby devaluing the dollar and launching the US into major economic upheaval.

Somewhere in all this oil will become fairly priced in Euro's but exorbitantly priced in dollars, if available at all.

You defend the $280 price you predicted early by the event of the Euro's actual introduction on the world currency market. Had that not occurred on time, the oil countries or country would have demanded a small amount of gold with each barrel of oil.

Finally, you believe that London, the Swiss, and the IMF will permit the dollar price of gold to go as low as $10.00 as they attempt to defend the inevitable.

Have I missed anything?

Comments: I believe your perception on the sidelines of the greatest chess match in history is superior to most, as you show an ability to play several moves ahead of others. Being an American, and a proud one, I hope that our leaders make the right decisions to protect our way of life but at the same time be fair to those who you have pointed out have been (in my words) screwed by the dishonored 1971 gold debts. I believe I sense a certain animosity and a certain predilection that you don't or won't see this happening again. In fact, and as I have stated earlier on, I believe you believe the pieces of the puzzle are in place and their for all to see and that has been your mission to expose or to teach those in the forum of this. If it weren't for you, most would have been blind sided by such moves as the BOE auctions, the IMF gold sales, and the Swiss need of selling, as the reasons they have given are not honest reasons. Although I can understand this, I do not condone and in fact am disappointed by their lack of forthrightness.

What each of us chooses to do about your words in on each of our shoulders. I hope and pray that we do what is right. Thank you.

SteveH (7/18/99; 10:33:37MDT - Msg ID:9100)

Mr. SteveH,
I read your post and find agreement with most of these words. Indeed, your perspective comes from: "Being an American, and a proud one". A same view and feeling you do share with FOA, for he is also, as you say, "born in the USA"!

You write (analyze): "Most Western countries, led by the BOE, the Swiss, and perhaps the IMF and its represented countries, are the ones entrenched in paper gold leasing and loans. These will be defaulted, but not before driving the price of paper gold to possibly $10-$100 per ounce."

You have read my post, yes? #9099
Again, in this comment (analysis of my thoughts), I note your western perception of these countries now "driving " the price of gold. I think, one should observe that this possible pricing level is achieved from a lack of "confidence" in the gold market to honor it's paper! My friend, it is the "buy side" that has backed away from this arena and forced this new evaluation. They withdraw, not from want of metal, rather from no need of fraudulent contracts. Mr. Canamami once asked, in a recent post, " what is holding up the big players"? I add, indeed, at these levels should not they be buying hand over the fist? (more on this in next item)
A true market must have a buyer and seller of good strength, to provide the fair value. This current market has both, and the value is "fair" in light of paper product offered.

You write (analyze): "As paper price declines against dollar, physical gold demand will increase even more at lower and lower prices until it is apparent that no physical gold can or will be delivered at such ludicrous prices."

The demand for physical gold has already taken all supply for some ten years out and more. Only, at present, this demand is manifest in the holding of paper gold. The realization that this current falling price will create tremendous demand upon what little "spot" physical there is, will ignite a rush to convert existing paper gold into real gold. A rising oil price in the face of falling gold may generate this fresh buying and expose this false market into action. To this end, your present gold market system will fail.

I offered to continue my Thoughts from an earlier post, with: "Why will gold paper be honored for special resources?" This will explain why "gold paper" of oil will be honored at all cost.

Thank You Another

Another look at the Gold to Oil Exchange rate. I have not posted these calculations for a great while. The numbers are becoming rather dramatic.

Gold/Oil Exchange Rate. These calculations are approximate.

Oil in USD per Barrel [Avg. for Yr]….Date….Gold Price [Avg. for Yr]….Gold/Oil Exchange Rate [Barrels of Oil per 1 OZ Gold]

Average is 21-1 for 1968-1999
Average for 1986-1999 is 26.5 to 1.

We are now at 12.75 to 1. This has been a dramatic movement over a very short period of time. Oil has been in the position for a number of months to acquire Gold for Oil at an absolutely favorable rate, which has only occurred before during a few brief moments over the last 30 years. What is Oils plan for Gold?
---------------------------------------------------
Mr. Jade,
Thank you for posting these numbers.
A new trend of a rising dollar price of oil may destroy the "dollar gold market" with liquidity. All past oil for bullion deals now become a stronger asset for Euro banks to hold. This improving ratio does speak much for the integrity of these loans. I should think that $30 oil will "gold plate" these assets for "preferred delivery".
For some time I have asked persons to consider that all gold paper will burn! The investment in physical gold by dollar holders will collect a lifetime of value. A value hidden in the dollar price of gold! Today, all "gold industry" paper is on fire, for all to see, as the present system for trading gold falls into failure. Indeed, $10,000 gold may prove a "contradiction" that cannot be true, yet
does exists in the future. In the past, the thought of such a price of gold did present the "irresistible" urge to buy into the industry, this "Dollar based market represents". Only greed can explain the need to gain more than the value "real bullion" will one day present.

Perhaps, it be the same "ages old" human emotion that forced America from a contract with gold! A contract with greatness, that now passes on to others.

I will be gone for a time!

Leigh (7/18/99; 18:50:38MDT - Msg ID:9129)

Mr. Stranger and Leigh,
Many do often find that my words do not express the Thoughts I wish ones to consider. My intent is to promote "consideration" of these thoughts and the events they propose. Also included in my post was this: "You will soon see gold begin to strengthen the Euro as the dollar continues into a mighty fall.". The collapse of dollar and dollar gold market is the event that begins this process. Also, expressed in this: "The order of events will show that the dollar will now fail, first, then all will race for Euro."
However, the context was not well presented. My effort was lost. Some find pain in these words even as others find direction. My wish is that all will find understanding in their own way.
We watch this new gold market together, yes?

A lot to read!
ALL and SteveH,
Rereading what Another sent this weekend and all the other posts. I'm going to have to think about this as some new thoughts are coming into view. Am still working on Chapter 3. This post was sent to me from Kitco (interesting?):

Copyright © 1999 mozel/Kitco Inc. All rights reserved
A Sovereign can stiff other Sovereigns if it's willing to risk war. The United States Government has stiffed all other Sovereigns since 1971 when it reneged on its gold contract. When USG reneged on it gold contract, settling current account deficit on a country to country basis broke down. This was not new. But, it had never happened before with the official creditor nation. When it happened with lesser Sovereigns, they were invaded and the debt was collected by soldiers. For example,
Mexico in the 19th century, France the collector; Haiti in the 20th century, USG the collector. What is the solution ?

The solution is to require international trade to settle in gold so no deficit can accummulate and so the war power of the Sovereign is removed from the commercial equation. This is the BIS part of it. You can't securely and conveniently settle internationally without BIS's participation as neutral third party ( "moneylaundering" is how the drug trade does this ). Gold will assume the role that the reserve account has in the Federal Reserve System. The settling party's CB or the party itself will have to have gold on deposit to complete the transaction, I suspect.

Now, consider all that part of the world whose unpayable debt is denominated in greenbacks. Further, consider the proposal to sell IMF gold to buy US bonds to relieve their debt burden. It's a mighty small carrot, isn't it, compared to the carrot of having your debt devalued by a revaluation of gold against the dollar in the numbers from $6K per oz to $30K per oz which FOA is speaking.

As I see it, countries are going to have to step to the mark and declare their currency's international trade value against the gold pricer ratio set by the Euro. China is pondering on this.

China and Russia now buy gold from domestic mines with local currency. India is moving to buy gold with local currency. In case this is not familiar to you, it's the FDR official local currency POG money system.

"
"Currency system ?" "World market price ?"
Observations. Currency system means international monetary system means IMF.
Or it means a new principle for currency.
World market price means gold is the pricer. Gold is now the pricer in the Euro.
There is also a presently inactive gold as the pricer ratio in the Articles of the IMF.
The alignment of these two ratios would create a world market pricer. Can you see
this as a possibility from your window ?
The other declared currency is the dinar. What is the relationship between the dinar
and the Euro in terms of gold grams ?

From here, it's starting to look like what the POG is in London and New York is purely a problem for the anglo-american bloc.

All Posts this weekend!
ALL:
I have been reading and thinking about many of the weekend post here. If things play out along the path that Another has outlined, this gold market is going to be a very hard one to stay with! I should have known this would be the case.
What makes us think that the fall of the dollar (or even a major inflation with the dollar still left intact), would open the door to easy profits for savvy gold and silver investors? Are we so naive (or ignorant) as to believe that our winnings would come without major risk and pain?

Think about this? What if the 1970s wasn't a guidebook for gold investing. Maybe it was only a controlled explosion in the gold price as Another offered. If so, what lies in the future could truly be the downfall of the dollar, and we will participate in a massive transfer (and loss) of wealth such as this generation has never seen Such a turn of events would most certainly come with incredible risk for anyone that would attempt to financially survive.

My views:

Anyone that tries to time this market with paper gold investments (futures, mine stocks, mine options, gold certificates, etc.) is making a play for a repeat of the 1970s markets. Or even a quick turn around of the current trend. Perhaps those are good bets.

But, what if, in the late 1990s we are currently beginning a "controlled implosion" of the dollar? A type of slow dollar debt destruction, that breaks every market that uses the dollar for settlement ? A kind of dollar squeeze that changes the psychology of foreign nationals that use it for trade. An attitude like this one from Asia::

"This dollar thing is killing us and it doesn't want to go away. Their (IMF) solution is to lend us more of the same! After all these years, it's getting to the point where we wouldn't lose that much if we just switched our trade to something else. We'll pay the dollar debt when and
if we can!"

Do you get my drift? This sort of "implosion" is a viable direction and would impact the gold market in a far different way than in the 70s. The dollar wouldn't necessarily crash quickly, just slowly be defaulted on in a transition from it's use. In this circumstance, buyers could create a major short squeeze/run in the paper gold market that could drive it's price so high, so fast, that the exchanges close from immediate bankruptcy (without any gold delivery).
OR, the world does just what I outlined above. The players on the buy side slowly back away from the dollar gold market (the entire present paper market as we know it) and allow it to short itself into bankruptcy in an effort to protect the dollar. Let's face it, the London market could "burn" as Another puts it, in both of these fashions.

Both ways, no one is going to be taking delivery of any physical gold during this era! Except for a black market, gold will have no viable market makers and no official exchange from where we "usually" buy today. As Another points out, gold will probably be trading on a new Euro
exchange and that is where he gets his $10,000++ rate if one uses dollars.

Friends, this is new and chilling for me. I truly never saw both sides of this, in this way. If the market does play out in this second fashion, paper and mine gold is indeed finished! Yet, physical bullion buyers must be prepared to buy into a product that no dollar price may exist for! Indeed, before all is done, the dollar gold price could fall to the degree that Another has offered!

Again, I should have realized this because I often pointed out that what was conning is a change in wealth the likes of which we have never seen. The swings in the dollar value of all assets will be enormous. If one is right about gold, their holdings could show the same swings in dollar
prices.

I must think longer on this, because, truly, I don't know what else to say!
Thanks Everyone FOA

SteveH(07/19/99; 21:50:05MDT - Msg ID:9217)

SteveH,
You pretty much hit on my feelings with this:

"I think FOA is saying ANOTHER surprised him and he hadn't considered the logical end-game if the IMF/$ folks push it to the limit. IMO, it won't make it that far."

Steve, That is exactly what I wanted to express with my #9204.

In response to this part of your post:

"In the meantime, the A/FOA guys seem to have been not so good on predicting prices but excellent at predicting behind the scenes explanations and motivations and directions to look. Time will in the end tell all. And we wait."

Steve, What I offer up is the private "Thoughts" of a very private person. I believe his appraisal of this ongoing political game comes from his real interaction in world events. On that count, his is the very basis of thinking in major circles. The "Total" concept offered was never so much about gold as it was an impending political move away from using the dollar. Yes, the impact on gold values will be important to us, but the real asset wars will be in the currency transition. For the majority of world commerce, this action dwarfs the gold market! The price of gold, the when and how much are interesting, but are far overshadowed by the "having of gold in your possession" before this change occurs! He (Another) said, he doesn't care what the dollar price is because it won't matter anyway. He sees it as a real money currency, here and now. I agree and try to
position myself for this event.

Most of the major critics of his Thoughts (there are many outside this public rendition) can not and will not see his outcome. I think that's because they are blinded by their portfolio. The truly "BIG' critics have massive real world holdings of companies and trade credits that would be
imperiled. I suspect people like "Stranger" have quiet holdings in some form of paper gold (mining stocks?) that will be chewed up big time in Another's world of events. Whether gold goes to $10,000 on the black market (or new official Euro market?) or it goes to $100 on a fictitious
dollar paper market, they lose everything. Their response is usually to attack the messenger because they can't build an adequate "time line of events" to explain what's currently happening to gold. They have a "Strange" concern that talking about this will induce a reading public to sell their paper gold (mine stocks included) or other investments, in some form of induced mine control! It's not that this might hurt the public so much as it might hurt the "critics" portfolio if the public sells. Besides, let's face it, anyone that brought physical gold some time ago has lost far less than paper gold investments purchased at the same time. In some cases the mines are gone, completely! So much for offering bad concepts for people to consider!

In addition, Another has always welcomed any thinking response, reply or statement. He does access this site through several links, reads the good western views and the rational they present.

The public bantering of Another by the LGBs and Strangers of the world only reinforces readers interest to follow these events more closely as they unfold. He always said to me that "the more people who stand on his shoulders, the more obvious his Thoughts becomes" (Steve, let me tell you, his mind and knees can stand the weight). Another, (leader that he is) knows people and has intense respect for their ability to think for themselves, once the accepted beliefs don't jive with what's happening in the real world. This is exactly what has happened as he offered these Thoughts from long ago. At first this "new gold market" wasn't doing anything different. Then it went way against the 1970s guidebook of technical analysis and group think. I have seen
many people comment that he took their line of thinking, when they didn't realize that he (Another) had offered it, in public long before their writings. The difference between them is that Another has always encouraged his analysis of these trends to be offered as their own. Through me he has put it "out there" for free, right or wrong, for everyone to consider. Often he presents it in an "off the wall " manner, usually to create a line of reasoning and thinking.

If we believe the Strangers of the world and think that the 1970s are going to repeat, then follow the standard line of western gold investing. But, if you "consider" these "Thoughts" and conclude that they may occur, then physical gold bullion is the only holding. Steve, (and all others
that discuss this) my recent post was offered to demonstrate the physiological difficulty we are going to endure if events play out as I described. These events demand that we take delivery "now" (as I have done and continue to do) even though gold may be priced at an "undeliverable" price later. A dollar price that could show major loses. I expect to hear from some that they are still buying some ounces of gold at $100, or whatever. Good, so will I. But, some of us have
much more to protect that a few thousand delivered ounces will cover. Conversely, if the price spikes in a week from a short squeeze that bankrupts bullion dealers, who is going to take delivery then?

If I am responsible at all to the concerns of readers, then I am fully concerned that people have the opportunity to judge this market as it evolves. And view it in a different light than what is offered by traders. To date, paper gold is burning, the Euro was created at least above parity to the dollar, oil is rising after the Euro birth and the ECB has stopped selling gold. To our "advantage" and good luck, oil did not bid for gold and the BIS did not chose to break the LBMA at $280. At this time, both of these entities may, MAY be allowing the paper traders to break themselves in support of the dollar with short sales.

To close, I add "Thank You Mr. Another", Thank Mr. Kosares of USAGOLD and thank everyone here for reading and discussing these Thoughts.

And not least: "GOD BLESS AMERICA, MY PLACE OF BIRTH AND MY HOME"

I have more to talk about this weekend. Does Alan see a change coming?


---------As Alan Greenspan said today,

"Something has got to give somewhere... Where it apparently will give at some point in the future is a lesser inclination to hold dollar claims on the United States..."


Greenspan sees no reluctance to hold dollars [July 22]

With a view to the clear and present risks of economic warfare, it is indeed surprising and indicative of a great deal of complacency that the average investor does not include a precautionary level of gold, gold stocks, and bear market funds (which seek to perform inversely to the main stock market indices) in their portfolios. Try mentioning such instruments on a stock market chat room and see what happens! ------------


USAGOLD,
I have a reply for you from Another. It was about your "Deflation" question several days ago. I also have a thought about it. Will post later. FOA

GOLD
ALL:
Because most of this "educated" generation has never received a true course in "what money is, no one explanation could possibly impart the truth into every mind. We are creatures of varying thoughts and viewpoints. Each of us can see only what our past life's experience allow us to bring
into focus. Another knew that it would take more than just "his" explanation of this "new gold market" to bring it's evolution into the mainstream.

He planted these seeds of understanding in truly "hostile ground". If any of you have undertaken to read "all" of Another's Thoughts and comments, it seems to be a trail into a thousands directions. Although, some found them consistent, most read with curiosity as they grasped only what they could. Indeed, the seeds were planted, DEEP! Today, I am happy to say that more are placing these Thoughts into real context. The water of "current events" is reaching the sprout zone, as people begin to explain what could not be taught.

If someone want's to understand "The Full Gold Concepts" as they can be applied to real life, they should read all of these writings:

Mr. Kosares ABCs of gold.
Mr. Kosares "In The Footsteps Of Giants"
Mr. Aristotle "Book Of Posts" in the USAGOLD Hall Of Fame
Mr. Aragorn has offered many posts and influenced the "Book Of Posts" creation.
Mr. SteveH has presented many good posts on the subject. Also he offered "ORO" from the Kitco forum. Read them at Steve's #9405 and #9340
Read and be part of the many informed USAGOLD Forum posters

To date, many others that post here and on the internet are voicing new views that clearly show a better grasp of how gold will impact our future lives. The more that people read the above items, the better will be their grasp of this new money from the past. The destruction of the dollar
as a world reserve currency will bring to the forefront the number one asset for the future, gold.

The present pricing mechanics used the world over to determine how one values and buys gold is failing. From it's short birth, only a number of decades ago to today's end time struggles, the modern gold market is the work of promoters. The same promoters that advance the current fiat
currency markets as a modern system for modern people. At the same time we "New Era" travelers are urged to largely ignore the massive failings this system has had for citizens around the world. A failure that many dollar holders worldwide are about to share with American savers.

Is $250 a fair price? More fair than you can imagine, when the new trend begins. A new trend of "non delivery" that is. Below is part of an Email I sent to Michael. More later.


------------- Be prepared for your readership to explode with the further exposure of the gold market. We are now in the middle of an outright effort to break the mechanics of the world gold market as it is currently used. The major players that stand behind (by buying paper gold) the bullion houses (most these are the LBMA) are backing away from
it's buy side. Now the dollar price of most gold securities are being discounted to reflect the liquidity of the market.

Because the world has only known physical gold to be priced in the London market using mostly derivatives paper, physical trades are being handled at a major discount to the value current demand would normally represent. Truly, the Bullion Banks must be buying some of their own short trades to establish a price. Yes, you read that correctly! A dying marketplace always ends up fabricating it's use to justify it's continued purpose.

The west has little knowledge of how to bid for bullion without going though the dollar market. This is why we may see the current gold price plunge until it negates the use of London as the "price maker". When the function of the physical market exposes this fraud by going around all forms of dollar gold securities, LBMA (and comex) will close
and gold will explode on a somewhat "black market".

No one knows when the physical trading will supplant paper trades. Today's price could be the bottom, or western investors may continue supporting the "fabricated" price (by not buying bullion) all the way down to who knows where? One thing is certain, the turn in this new market will not be a repeat of the 70s guidelines. There won't be any bullion to bid on when everyone attempts to switch from derivatives to
the real thing.

This is why so many were perplexed by Another's ongoing Thoughts of this market. It is a market in evolution towards a predetermined end. Every Western mind (educated in current market function) will reject the notion that there will not be any gold to buy at the bottom. Nor, will there be any available for the first $1,000 off the bottom (if there is
a quoted market to show this price).

Is this the bottom? Could be. The persons, that have most of the gold are now are pulling out from participation and will not create the turn. It will come from those that hold undeliverable claims on gold (or are waiting to buy lower), that discover they hold nothing. The whole market dynamics will become very confusing as this unfolds.

---------PS. FOA, the first paragraph above seems to describe what a Gold contract for oil is. Did I get it
right?

Bullion Banks guarantee or deliver gold to a bullion bank for a small fee of 1 or 2%. Most probably only guarantee gold backing in the event a bullion bank defaults. A bullion bank cuts a deal with a mining for physical gold in return for money to operate. The mine pays back the loan over time with gold plus gold interest. One or more oil countries buy the contract from the Bullion Bank for the repaid gold from the mine with dollars from oil production. The oil country now receives the gold that the mine repays. The bullion bank's guarantee from the CB goes with the contract to the oil country. So, if a mining company defaults on a repayment, the Bullion Bank will guarantee the oil country payment against the default. It may actually have to go to a CB for the gold to repay the default. This is what I believe is happening in the Bank of England Auction.----------------

Steve,
It's right in that that is one of many ways. When one reads "Aristotle's Work", it's so easy to see the purpose behind it all. The maintenance of a world fiat currency system requires a constant expansion of liquidity (more money) to keep it working. In the old days, when a borrower
defaulted on a "gold loan" (that was what a dollar loan was back then) the entity that held that debt paper lost his buying power. Be it the bank or an individual, the loan security became worthless and was written off. The write-off was certain because no one could (or would) come up with the gold to pay off the loan. Eventually, the US did issue more "gold loans" in the form of the dollar ("a gold contract currency") than it had gold to honor the $35 contract. Just a plain old fraud of creating new money so someone of importance didn't have to fail (lose some of their wealth).

Today, all kinds of loan guarantees are used to back modern fiat dollar loans. If they default, someone (a national treasury) prints the money to buy the loan so no one loses anything. Usually, if the loan is guaranteed, the lending institution just lends more money to try and keep the business going. However, in real life, a fiat reserve system, just as in a gold money system, is always in a
natural state of deflation as bad loans appear. So, in time, a paper money system always swells large enough to pass the point that it can create more liquidity (money).

That's what happened with the dollar reserve world. Every US treasury obligation held as a Central Bank reserve was used to create it's maximum amount of liquidity. Sometime in the 80s or so they had to start borrowing against gold as debt defaults were destroying wealth faster than the dollar system could supply replacements.
We all worry so much about CBs lending gold reserves, my friend, every other reserve they hold is in the form of lent assets! I won't find any crisp, unlent dollar bills in any of their reserve hoards. The gold represented the last asset for the expansion of the world money supply. It's lent
because they can fractionalise (sp?)it just like a fiat currency. One ounce sold creates only one ounce of liquidity. One ounce lent, can create 90 ounces of paper gold and the dollar liquidity that provides. When they do actually sell it, most of it goes to other CBs. A "fact" supported by the WGC that no one wants to factor, because it destroys their argument about the CBs supplying physical to fill the deficit. Check it out, 300 tones or so over ten years is the net out reduction of gold reserves.

All of this bears out why this entire "new gold market" is SO important to the present dollar / IMF system. It's entirely a paper gold arena that really trades CB vault gold "as guarantees". Crash this Arena and the dollar is history as we know it.

USAGOLD (7/20/99; 10:37:50MDT - Msg ID:9275)

Your words:

It is important to note along these lines that Another has turned the discussion toward thepossibility of deflation in the United States (as I read it) at precisely the time that Greenspan and Duisenberg seemed to be acting against the same phenomena in the currency markets. Gold might
be seen here as a messenger -- and this certainly is the subject we should be focused upon. Do I think the U.S. economy has switched to a deflationary bias? I don't know but it is certainly a matter of interest to me to know what Another is thinking along those lines. (If I am wrong in my
assumptions, good sir, please clarify your position for me.)

By the way has anyone else had the thought that unbridled short speculation made possible through the proliferation of derivatives has driven down all commodities including gold and perhaps brought us to the brink of a deflationary failure? I am toying with the idea and I am wondering if this isn't a phenomena Greenspan and Duisenberg are thinking about. I have considered that perhaps when these two saw what was happening to gold (and the euro) -- being
mercilessly beat into the ground by the shorts -- at the expense of the producers worldwide that perhaps something needed to be done and fast.....Hence yesterday's interventions.

Comments anyone?

Sir, I would add this for your consideration.
This deflation of today, I think it is not the same beast of years past. See deflation in the Japans, it shows a strong yen and falling prices. Fight it they do with no avail. That is the performance you speak of, yes.
Not to be for the dollar. Mr. Greenspan does overcome any such outcome with the ink and paper at his disposal. His concern is loss of use of dollars. The beginnings of such an evet would create the far different deflation from which you speak. I think, "stagflation" would apply as prices
of imported goods rise as local assets fail. Loss of dollar as reserve currency would cause large external "collateral damage" for financial institutions. Such lowering of values would create the "deflation" beside the "inflation" of foreign costs. Bad mixture indeed. The walk away from dollar
use is result of "commodities values" of unfair proportions when viewed in dollar contracts. A result the Greenspan does not want and can not prevent.
I think your family investors will find the failure of this gold market to their liking. It always has been the world "institutional arena". It is there that this paper gold price decline will destroy assets. Your coins "of inventory" will show the "real bullion value in dollars" long before advantage is taken by public. News of $100 or $200 gold brings the quick destruction of Bullion houses, in
hours! It also brings the 500 customers to bid for last ten ounces. Your new price will reflect this, yes? A new market with a fair price. A price that reflects the true value of oil in free market of
gold.
It is the event to observe, that few will be part of.

Thank You Another

FOA, your continuing efforts are appreciated.

Aragorn III,
Thank you for the thank you, sir!

The revelation of a failing gold market always struck me as one with a sky rocket dollar price. It took me a while to gather the thoughts of where he was going with this. Your partial Email to a friend is a perfect expression of what is happening. Very well explained. I earlier understood the
dynamics when I realized that the "plunge" would be a "end" event with a very short duration. The positioning of the market, prior to such a catastrophe, will no doubt bring six month lead times for delivery of physical. A dealer with "bullion on hand" would never sell it anywhere close to "paper reality" in such a market. Just as Another pointed out tonight, the end time paper price is something no one is going to participate in.

Conversely, an external event could plunge the dollar before this all plays out. In that situation, the shorts would shut it down in a mad scramble to close. Then we have "Bullion Bank destruction" from a soaring price. This was my "limited" conclusion. I think everyone can now see the difference between my brain and Another's!

I agree with you entirely about Ted Butler and GATA. They don't realize what they are fighting, in that the entire Western monetary system is built on the same concept as gold lending. The system will destroy itself, as it always does. Yet, we will go to war before any "manmade"
lawsuit forces an end to the dollar reserve system.

Just as the WGC saw the error of their ways in promoting gold as jewelry, so should GATA change. If they want to preserve their members (GATA) lost asset values, as represented in mining stocks, they should be attacking the mining industry. Not the Bullion Banks. The quickest
way to wealth recovery would be for every mine to declare bankruptcy from "impaired assets" due to low gold prices. It would jam the shorts into covering and impair the Bullion Banks before they could attach assets in court. The big time rise in gold would still shut the market, however the
negotiating table would be full of "let cut a deal lawyers", supplied by the CBs, free of charge.
All of you stock owners out there would have to live with no market for your investments until this works out. I have to admit, this would make me invest in the industry. It will never happen, of course.

@FOA
http://www.usagold.com
Mr. FOA, I have not posted here before. However, I have followed Another's posts since they first appeared on Kitco. I have been particularly confused about the inclusion of gold shares in his "will burn" category. When I questioned this way back on Kitco, Another reasoned that when physical gold became astronomically priced in dollars, governments would seize the mines. Now, the reasoning is less clear except to refer to mining shares as "paper." Please explain how shares are paper. They are not promisory notes like debt instruments. Yes, they are dependent on some degree of civil order, but so is private ownership of anything, including my house. Perhaps Another is referring to the paper transactions which gold mining companies have entered into? Butlet's look at those. For example Barrick, in which I own some share, has borrowed physical gold from central banks and sold that gold. They then bought treasury instruments with the money.
They make money on the difference between the interest rate paid on the gold and the rate received on the paper they own. What are the risks? Well, THEY are the DEBTOR party in the physical gold transaction. It's the Central bank, or others, who hold the paper. They (Barrick) hold government paper. Does Another mean THAT paper will "burn?" Please explain this to me if you would. Respectfully, Carl



Carl,
I'm glad you posted here and hope you read this. Here is my understanding of the risks involved with owning mining shares.

From the very beginning, Another was offering distinct comments about portions of a "larger problem" in the gold market. Usually, these were offered "in the context the current events" and structured to make people think. A signal of sorts, sent to accepted western knowledge that "not everyone in the world agreed that the dollar was the only money. Descriptions were given as to the reaction some entities would have to certain "events".

A recent partial post as an example of his intent, in his own words:

--------------ANOTHER (7/17/99; 20:27:12MDT - Msg ID:9079)
THOUGHTS!
" Many expected outcomes are born from the understanding of social interactions. If the king declares all thieves are to be executed, one does understand that death is to befall an apprehended pickpocket. It is the unproved, but "expected" result, yes?

Such is the case as one evaluates the world political game. A game we play with many kings. I place my wealth with respect to the past actions and present thoughts of current rulers. Seldom does one have the luxury of experiencing the actions of leaders, prior to the events that trigger
said response! I would bow low before such knowledge!

Truly, $280 was an inflection point that would, indeed, have ended this present currency system as it is known. An action to have been taken, in another time and place, for a
predetermined event. Without the birth of the Euro?, as the expected action, "the purchase would have been done". ----------------------

Carl,
The ongoing problem with the world gold price, as expressed in the world reserve currency was that it's value was incorrect for a human reason. Not because of some supply demand effect. Gold today, was still the money it was a hundred years ago. The governments had only decided not to use it as money in an "official way" because they couldn't pay it's true value in the production of goods and services. That price would have included "official loses" and "real
bankruptcy" for their economies. Even after it's removal from the use of "local" money, they kept right on trading it against their currencies. Only they did it on what was called a free market "commodity" exchange. Through out the 70s and most of the 80s, Central Banks brought, sold
and loaned gold just like the paper currencies. Only the currencies were "official" government money and gold was "just a metal". A metal that competed like hell against the dollar.

Carl, call it what you will, but the gold bull of the 70s and partial rallies of the 80s were never the free market "textbook guidelines" that people buy gold mining stocks for. That period is the only moment in history that present investors have as their example of gold trading as a
commodity. A moment in time that never saw a "free market "in gold. It was simply a "controlled explosion" that eventually contained it's price. Gold did not, at any time come close to it's true value price that it's use as money would have required.

During this time (after 71), the dollar came to settle almost all trade, and it's use distorted the true value of all commodities, not just gold and oil. The very day that the dollar left the gold exchange standard, every currency in the world became a kind of modern day derivative
contract. Without the use of gold to settle foreign trade surpluses (and deficits), countries had to settle these differences in dollars. In real life, their Central Banks exchanged excess dollars for US treasury holdings and held them externally (outside the US). In effect, these foreign native currencies no longer reflected their citizens productive efforts in real terms. Their money became
derivatives of the value of the dollar, as "IT" expressed it's value in terms of the "commodity" market in gold. In effect, the very dollar that found it's value in a low gold price, was the same dollar that created the price of gold.

The most visible exchange for gold is comex. On that exchange one can sell thousands of contracts without owning one ounce of gold. Virtually all of the contracts are settled for cash. You don't even have to borrow gold to sell it. All you need are dollars as long as the trader on the long side settles for cash. Multiply this times the massive, far less visible world market for gold as it's easy to see how gold can be traded against currencies. As long as it is settled in "CASH"!

The present world gold market negates the true value of gold by removing the "real demand" that "gold settlement" creates! Break the mechanics of this market and you will find that gold is the most valuable currency in today's currency arena. Many investors, today think that the answer to this dilemma is for traders to take delivery and cause a short squeeze. My friend, in this arena, taking delivery means settling in cash! No, this market will not be destroyed by anyone but itself. Even a "short" cannot sell to himself, but for so long. In that light, major bullion buyers are walking away from this fraud of a market and allowing it to break itself from non participation.

I assume you have read my post: FOA (07/24/99; 14:26:57MDT - Msg ID:9585) and all the fine, up to date articles mentioned there. It will give a true background for this work.

When the dollar was on the gold exchange standard, all gold mines were effectively taxed into a a state of very low profits. The tax came in the form of the artificial gold price represented as $35 per ounce. With the dollar trading as a "contract currency" for gold, none of these mines
attempted to circumvent this fraud because the dollar was the official representation of gold value received. Their "business plan" was to sell gold for currency, not use gold as currency! For mines in the US, the latter was "against the law"! Only the Treasury could make legal tender. Except for brief moments in time, their shares were poor investments.

Today, many investors only see mining shares in the light of the 70s. Blinded by the fact that it was only a period of transition between gold eras. From a period of governments failing to use gold as money into a period of total use of one fiat currency value as money, the dollar. Now we enter an era where gold becomes the dominate currency value of the world. Even as other paper moneys continue to trade in commerce, a free market in the trading of "real gold only" will come to pass. It will "mark to the market" all currencies in question. During this time, gold mines (if they can remain private) will again, carry the burden of the heavy government hand of taxation because of the real nomey value they mine.

Another envisioned two paths for gold to follow during this period. Both trails lead to the failure of the dollar and it's many thousands valuation in gold. One contained an external event, such as a BIS intervention, oil bidding for gold or a major crash in financial markets At the time,
posters could hardly grasp these events as plausible, let alone consider them. In the context of the time these were the most possible if the Euro was not produced. Analysis did not even want to discuss the manipulation of this market, let alone move through a trend line of logic to consider
what may lie ahead! Some were even heard to say that such thoughts were "on the fringe of reality".

Now we can clearly see into the future as the failure of present gold market to exist is a real possibility. It's impact on the mines would be devastating as they would be bound to continue selling into this arena.

--------FOA, your continuing efforts are appreciated.
FOA, there was much made by several posters one week ago of the appearance that ANOTHER had "changed his mind" about the direction of the gold market and price. Your post today affirms my suspicion, as related in the opening portion of my e-mail (partially reproduced below) sent mid-week to a friend that also reads this forum.
-------
It seems to me that ANOTHER has not so much changed his mind as it seems he has recognized the potential for a path to be taken that from several paces back upon our trail did not seem apparent or even remotely possible. Yet here it is. Successful delivery/receipt of metal will truly be the key, as he says. You may recall a post a couple weeks ago with a seemingly obscure comment by FOA that essentially "the price could be falling because the banks were no longer able to find an adequate supply of deliverable gold". And while
that notion flies in the face of the "common" sense of many, you need only to consider how this price might indeed fall as the "Big Purchaser" would no longer be supporting what has become a ludicrous paper gold trade...no interest in
buying the paper with no hope for future delivery. This system did make sense as a contracting mechanism alternative from the dollar during a time that they could reasonably self liquidate. But a span of years and commercial speculators through fractional reserve lending has brought yet another quasi-fiat currency (paper gold) to the end of its useful life. You can almost hear them shout... "NEXT!"

Can you picture a person starving as "paper food" falls to a price of poor investment returns? No! The time comes when possession means more than price of paper by paper--an old fashioned run on the bank...for gold!
This is where Ted Butler and also GATA have a clouded view of the problem, and proclaim unfair institutional manipulation of this special financial commodity. If they would see it as pure money, they would easily recognize the "time-pattern of value" of paper gold follows exactly the diminution of any other currency under a banking system of
fractional reserve lending. Consider how many must think they hold the equivalent value of gold, when what they truly hold is only an illusion...an artificial portion of a lender's artificially inflated supply! With credit-based fiat currencies it is not meaningful to have a run on a bank for your fair share of ledger numbers. However, the gold-based monetary system that exists worldwide is not immune to such a "run". As this current paper system fails, the metal that remains will inherit the vast value spread thin over much imaginary paper supply. While they are to be commended for their passion, GATA's interests would be best served if their efforts were focused on education and lobbying for an end to the currently lawful banking practice of fractional reserve lending.

--"Compare with The Gold Market: Part 2 by J Orlin Grabbe--

"Gold accounts at a bullion house may be allocated or unallocated. The unallocated account is most typical. One holds on deposit a specific number of ounces of gold, but
these ounces of gold are not identified with any individual physical gold bars. These unallocated accounts may or may not bear interest.... All clearing accounts are
unallocated accounts...."

"Most gold trading takes place by paper transfers between unallocated accounts. Bookkeeping entries avoid the transactions costs and security risks of moving the actual
metal...clearing members clear their net trades with one another through their gold accounts at the Bank of England, as well as by physical gold transfers."

various thoughts
What is a "natural market" as opposed to a "manipulated market"? Do people really think that the only true natural markets are where every owner sells everything he can at whatever price current demand will bring? Like wise, every buyer buys all he can use at whatever price current supply will provide? When I read some of the philosophical reasoning presented on the net, I get the distinct feeling that the human factor should not play a part in the marketplace. In other words, anyone that holds off from buying or selling, waiting for a better price, is helping to manipulate the market. Has mankind lost sight of the fact that for a human marketplace to be "natural" it must show the imprint of "ulterior motives" in it's trading price! Yes? No?

Say, I am a big time oil owner and considered not to sell any of it. One day I decided to pump 100 million barrels into a giant tank. I'll just hold it there with the intent of selling it later at what I considered a better price. Am I manipulating this commodity? Or do my actions present the "natural" greed and fear that must be present in a human marketplace? Perhaps, I do not feel that the present world dollar prices of oil, gold, copper, cotton or corn, truly represent the "human use value" this currency reflects. If others think that fiat currencies offer the "natural" values that "supply and demand" create, do I have to sell to escape their damnation of my intent? Is it
manipulation because I play all factors into my reasoning? I do consider that, usually these "critical" voices come from "economies" that are already receiving more production value per barrel than the dollar price can reasonably repurchase in real things.
It's like the carpenter that is making $.05 per hour on a government job and his manager tries to convince him that is all he is worth. We should not blame the manager for taking advantage of the system? In the same light, nor should we underestimate the ability of Western economist to
justify the "supply and demand values" of oil as expresed in dollars. Their readers are coming out ahead, just as long as supply and demand is settled in "their" dollars, that is!

Some even profess that world trade must "play by the rules" and deal in a spirit of honesty . But, what are these rules? And what is honest in our world trading system?

The present world banking operation creates a monetary arena that demands everyone to settle the transfer of all goods and services in a "fiat money" system. One that is clearly "manipulated" to the advantage of each country. The Japanese wrestle the value of the Yen to promote their trade advantage. Every country has it's "behind the scene" method of "interfering" with the way world trade sets the value of it's currency. Do not the actions of these countries truly
reflect the needs and wants of their working populous? Even if their motives are, by design, manipulation, they do this with a perception to help their citizens. Even with this view, we see the imprint of "human nature" in world trade, as it's always been.

My point is that "manipulations" are a large part of modern trade valuations. Under a fiat monetary system, it is a "natural" tendency to hold for "your best terms" because the value received in paper currencies is always changing. Just look at 1985, when the G7 plunged the value of the dollar. What was that? Honest "value reduction" in a currency, "new rules to play by" or just a plain old natural response to a modern world?

So why do so many search for and cling to reasons that cannot apply in this current trading market?

A lot of people have been caught holding the wrong "outcome opinion" on this gold dollar thing. Just as in the above analogy, many "Western economist" that analyze the gold market also use a "western dollar perspective" to advise the same conclusion. That being, because we cheated
the rest of the world to maintain our lifestyle, we are due for a little inflation and loss of dollar value. So, lets compensate by buying some gold, leveraged gold paper and gold stocks to retain any of our lost wealth.

Well, it just isn't working out that way, is it? You see, that "perspective" is based upon several concepts that we have "evolved" past:

1. "The repeat of the 1970s international currency panic."
That panic never ended and is in evolution into this day! The dollar reserve system has been patched up with debt and more debt over all these years. It was maintained because, prior to the Euro there was no other alternative to go to without shattering the world economy "completely".

2. "A 70s repeat of a rise in gold prices in dollars, at least back to the $400 or $500 range."

That gold bull of the 70s was a controlled burn! Contrary to every thinker, they allowed gold to be sold into the market to take the pressure off the dollar. As the price rocketed, it was easy to see that only a tiny fraction of the dollars held overseas would ever be exchanged into gold at any reasonable price. To fully complete the deal would have seen gold in the many thousands.
The rising gold price sealed the fate of the world into using dollars in settlement. In effect they said, raise the prices of oil (and anything else) but you must settle trade in dollars. The USA would then write IOUs to everyone on the planet in order to keep the system going. In effect, to the world, stop buying physical gold, put the dollar on an oil standard, through dollar only settlement and "gold " will be priced to your advantage in a different venue.
Remember, in those days, they did not have a functioning "derivatives" market for gold. The only method of manipulation available was to allow it's price to rise in open auctions, well before any major portion of "foreign" dollars were exchanged. Stopping the auctions put gold back
undercover. Falling gold prices kept the dollar on an oil standard until alternatives could be worked out. It "IS" a different game today!

3. "The continuation of a world gold market, expressed and settled only in dollars."

Few people ever factor in what would happen if the London gold market stopped trading gold. It's a "given" among "Western economist" that this is "the way it is" and could never change. If the IMF/Dollar gold market ever failed (from Y2K or whatever) all gold trading would revert to physical, immediately!
The amount of gold held around the world in paper "derivative" form is enormous. It dwarfs any reasonable estimate I have seen. Every analyst that expresses current supply and demand for gold as under 5,000 tons per year, truly doesn't have a clue. London moves that much "demand"
around in a week. Much of it in the modern world form, "derivatives". It is in this massive new market that gold ownership has exploded without spiking the price. On the contrary, this market created the falling dollar price of gold as a function of "maintaining a dollar reserve system".
Without this new form of gold market, a rising physical price would have destroyed the dollar well before the Euro could be established. However, within this paper gold system lies the ultimate self-destruction of the dollar and the destruction of the entire gold industry that relies upon the LBMA for settlement.

more on various thoughts
Hello to all the new writers here! Old Gold, is that you?

If you have read my last post #10016, I assume you have also read my post: FOA (07/24/99;14:26:57MDT - Msg ID:9585) and all the fine, up to date articles from other writers mentioned there. It will give a true background for this work.

Back into #10016:
If one buys into any dollar based venture today, he is making an assumption that the Central Banks of the world stand ready to maintain this currency as the current world reserve. An assumption, that I believe will cause a major loss of wealth as this plays out. Today, we have "evolved" past the need to keep the dollar "above value" in terms of real things.

Forcing foreign trading partners to take on more dollar debt in an effort to maintain the credibility of past debt is destroying the world economic system. In the past, a US trade deficit provided a home for dollar reserves outside it's local market. Because these "foreign held" dollars
were held as backing for other currencies, they expanded the international monetary base during a time of increased world trade. Through out the 80s and 90s, as the American inflation of it's currency threatened several financial blow ups, this system still offered the only logical alternative.

Today, competitive devaluation's of foreign currencies is changing the "old expanding" qualities of the US trade deficit. The same dollars, once sent to buy "overseas", are now contracting the very currency systems they once backed. These economies no longer earn a "return on commerce" large enough to generate enough dollar reserves. Truly, the more Americans buy from their failing trading partners, the more their local currency systems contract. Generating the need
for more IMF induced debt. Debt in the form of dollars that flow back into servicing old debt without creating new money. An endless circle that points to the end of using dollars as reserves. Clearly, this new era has sent the IMF / dollar supporters searching for every form of liquidity
expansion possible in an effort to buy time.

This is the expected outcome from using a patched up reserve system, built upon an ever higher mountain of debt. The effect creates lower buying costs (price disinflation) in the currency host country (USA) as it destroys foreign financial holdings by building debt into the balance
sheets without increasing real assets. The only countries that can escape this fate are ones that can insulate their trading block with a new reserve asset currency (Euro) or have "commodity assets" large enough to back entire currencies (oil).

It is this "deflation" draw down in world trade that will force the removal of the dollar as the settlement currency in international transactions. The modern evolution of events clearly show that no other path can be taken. It is well within the authority of the BIS take this route. It is a reaction that the dollar has brought upon itself from the early 70s decision to drop gold.

The moment that this event transpires, the global deflation of dollar financial holdings will change into the hyperinflation of all local US assets. The exact same fate awaits every country that has tied it's economy and treasury to the dollar. A process completely out of the hands of the
Federal Reserve and one that will require "intense foreign exchange controls"!

I suspect that the gold market, itself will signal this event long before it's arrival. All or some major players in the paper gold market will pull away from it's use and create a void on the buy side of the trade. A logical point because the dollar gold contracts could never settle physical gold at the price a "non reserve" dollar would produce. As I said before, this could destroy the current
mechanics of the world gold market and could plunge the paper price as the trading market fails. Another gives this good odds, I don't?
I think (and have prepared for) a financial event, that triggers the withdrawal of dollar users and forces a physical bidding war beyond the confines of the current gold market. Either way, the dollar price of gold will soon soar as London is removed from the gold window!

In reply to Carl, I also think that gold mine stocks will (in some way) suffer as they are locked by their local governments, into selling gold at (new) controlled prices to honor dollar credits. Also, most all of them will, no doubt (in all the confusion) be trading otc options and futures in
current dollars, not to mention their gold loan repayments. I hope you are right in that they are smart enough to wiggle through this. FOA

If the market is going "against" one's BOOK,then it is perfectly reasonable to believe the market is manipulated....if you don't believe me ask M.Armstrong when silver spiked up to $7.50

Good point CM!

I was "in there big time" when the Hunts were knocked off! That incident alone was enough to show me that the silver market was internationally too small. Because it was an industrial metal in the minds of CBs, they didn't have an agenda with it. When Comex locked out the Hunts, the big
currency players didn't care.
The sane thing will happen again in a different format. Because the gold market is today the product of a paper expansion of epic proportions, every player in the world will be trying to raise liquidity to cover his gold short exposure if the market is closed. Just as most of the silver shorts brought gold in the late 70s to cover some of their silver exposure, then sold it, today, they will sell their silver in the same mad rush. Only the silver market is nowhere deep enough to handle the selling. It's price could go to? In the Hunt thing gold easily contained the liquidity selling by silver short holders.
What I'm saying is that, if they close the gold market because of currency problems, silver and most of the other commodities will probably keep trading. Only, by association, those with major short gold exposure will not lose that obligation just because the market is closed. They will sell into anything that is precious metal related because they won't have any other way to cover!

On another note: If you remember, a few weeks (months) ago I said that we should look at comex open interest to see when the gold shorts were establishing long positions to balance their world market short holdings. That would signal their run for cover. Well they never did. In fact, OI is plunging! This does nerve me a little as it gives backing to what Another said about the major players backing out of the system! I hope this changes, as it will be a real challenge for most bullion holders (don't even think about mine owners!) to understand this dynamic.

Aristotle (8/2/99; 0:04:57MDT - Msg ID:10122)
FOA thanks for your Saturday effort!

Aristotle,
If you have read my Saturday #10016/10020, I want to add on to that line of thinking. SteveH asked where it all started so I told him "Jamaica Accords". In good order, Cage Rattler #10065, found a nice rundown about the entire evolution of the world monetary system. The link is above.
Everyone here should read all of it because it helps put into perspective much of the Historical material that we analyze.

In section, 2.B Bretton Woods Agreements (1944-1973), it gets right into the breakdown of the money system. --------- "In January 1976, the IMF convened a monetary summit in Jamaica to reach some agreement on a new monetary system. The Jamaica Accords formally recognized the managed floating system and allowed nations the choice of a foreign exchange regime as long as their actions did not prove disruptive to trade partners and the world economy. Gold was demonetized as a reserve asset. The Jamaica Accords were ratified in April 1978." --------

This is where many investors lose the concept and start declaring "manipulation"! Right here, our leaders agreed in writing to a "managed floating system". I guess it needed to be clarified further in the form of "manipulated floating system". Nothing here about moving the currency markets in response to "free world supply and demand" is there?
Next, it gave an open hand to using whatever a country thought was best as a currency or reserve. This item, "allowed nations the choice of a foreign exchange regime" was hotly debated, I know! Because everyone knew what it meant. It was aimed directly at the "new" gold market. Buy on the market all that you want, but be prepared for the price to soar. If anyone, just had to get rid of their dollars quickly (in a year or so), you were not going to get a deal.

Their purpose was to sell gold over time (many years), so as to allow the markets to balance themselves. To do this, they didn't "demoneyize" gold as everyone on the planet has said they did. The Europeans and the oil countries would have dropped the dollar right then and there. They only demonetized gold as a "reserve asset", repeat, a "reserve asset"! This was the only way to unlock gold for delivery and or modern day trading without driving up it's price.

Notice that these accords were not ratified until April 78. Right after that , in the fall, the US started selling gold in a "controlled burn" (because it was no longer a reserve asset) to satisfy those who wouldn't wait. Don't get me wrong, everyone bid on it because no one knew if the
accords would work "over time"! Price inflation was to be the balancing mechanism until gold could again be sold into the sea of foreign dollars.

A big agenda for the US in all of this was to get the price of oil up! If this action didn't accomplish that, every US producer was going to run out of oil reserves because of our high cost production. The Middle east could, and still can, produce for almost nothing compared to us. But that's Another story.

We suffered through most of the 80s waiting for more gold to be sold. Europe (and oil) got tired of waiting and proceeded to build the Euro out of the EEU. Isn't it interesting how quickly the LBMA was born to market gold, in the late 80s in response to this new initiative. Their first
purpose was to create a paper gold market to trade commitments of CB gold. The dollar price of oil has been falling in fits and starts, right along with this new liquidity in the gold market.

This rough explanation brings us into the 90s. But that is where things started to change. SteveH is asking (hi Steve) for a look at a written agreement. The real contracts are written in the LBMA commitments. As for a international or heads of government signed accords, the Jamaica is a close as you will ever see. Often, in politics, protocols are but forced standoffs. Just like when two armies stop shelling each other. Someone makes the wise observation that "the generals must have come to an agreement to stop fighting". Yet, a reporter, trying to make a "responsible"
assessment to the public, asks "when will we see a copy of the contract?"! My friend, the observer exclaims, "the events and the actions are the agreement"!

Going back to my earlier posts:
Aristotle, when the dollar went off the gold exchange standard in 71, it was the modern day equivalent of destroying the gold market. Back then, all dollars were "gold loans" in every sense of the word! The world dollar market was the gold market that everyone used. When that market failed, because there wasn't enough gold to deliver against the "gold loans", everyone was left holding "empty gold loans" in the form of dollars!

Yet, today, tell people that the gold derivative markets that represents 90% of the entire gold market is going to fail from non delivery, and they don't conceive it can happen! This is an arena that isn't even a government treasury production, as the dollar was back then.

Every mining company in the world is required by their local governments to sell their gold for currency. None of them are allowed to barter that gold for goods and services. If the present world gold market fails as the dollar did in 71, the price of gold will continue to be established
through trading on this same "discounted" derivatives market. Just as people kept trading and using "discounted" dollars after it failed in 71 as a contract for gold. Yes another physical market will no doubt develop, but no new "from the ground" production will be allowed to trade "off the established exchange". Just as US "savings and loan banks" continued to operate as viable institutions, even though they were worthless, so to will the LBMA be propped up by the US/IMF because it is too big to fail.

This entire play will be acted out during the confines of a transition of currency power. The final evolution of the dollar from world reserve currency into the Euro as reserve currency. I suspect that an alternative physical gold market in Euros will begin to show this destruction.

Everyone should read Mr. James Turk "What Does It All Mean" to grasp just how "non-typical" this market truly is. Many of the old accepted actions of gold, in response to "usual" events are being invalidated. Through out the net, gold thinkers continue to look for a return of "inflation" to bring back the "good old days" of "bunker Hunt silver" and "fast rising comex gold"! The future may not repeat the past. We shall see. In the days to come, we will do well to consider following in "The Footsteps Of Giants" as they continue to lead in a direction of "physical only"
gold. FOA

I understand your reasoning, I think. You are presuming that the Euro will replace the dollar as the world requires a reserve currency. "Europe" has never been in the lead nor has any European country been a dominant player in geo politics since Hitler. I discount Russia because, IMHO, the
Russians are not Europeans. I discount Britain because I really don't believe the British are or were Europeans and I believe they believe the same. The Euro must be forced into a role of monetary dominance yes? Is this the oil position? Also, I ask you and Another for a third or perhaps fourth time now; why would the rest of the world let the economy of the strongest nation on earth ( debatable I agree)go into the tank? Yes, there is a penalty for sin even with repentance but why level the US economy? Can't it be saved? Please elaborate. Thanks.

Cavan Man,
When a currency dominates the world, it usually isn't forced into that position. It evolves there from forces governments cannot stop! Did you think the entire world wanted the dollar to be on top from long ago? A quick history read will show that other governments tried to prevent it, but couldn't. Just as the British Pound fell from dominance, they didn't want it to happen either, but
couldn't stop it.

Understand, the dollar isn't being forced out of position because it's getting better. It's building so much debt that it's destroying the current world economy. If you think it's been doing a good job, then please read the history of Foreign Exchange (in the link I provided earlier). My friend, battle after battle has been fought to save the dollar, not destroy it! Did you think Nixon took it
off the gold standard to "kill it"? No, they were trying to patch it back into some useful form, as nothing else was available.

The world economy will demand a useful currency as the dollar further fails to do it's job. They will go to the Euro for the same reason they have stayed with the dollar all these years, "there isn't anything else"! As this modern world has evolved well past the use of physical gold as a
circulating currency, a "free world gold market", not based upon any government will provide the "mark to the market" valuations governments need to measure paper money in trade. The Euro will indeed be held against gold, but not as a gold loan (as in contract currency at $35 to the ounce) standard of the past. That system clearly failed as the present dollat/IMF gold market shows.

Does Europe want this position? I doubt it, but given what is coming down the pipe for the dollar, they will most likely be glad for it.

My friend, I (as taken from Another) use the term "western view" because it is a clouded perception of how the world sees the dollar. For the dollar countries, it buys much at the expense of others. The very strong dollar that "bulls your stock markets" does not clearly represent the
value of the foreign goods it is exchanged for. Your view is to save the dollar and the US economy because it is holding up the rest of the world. That is the very problem, as only on a dollar based reserve system does this occur. Instead of using a currency based upon only one countries interest, the USA, use a currency based upon the "conflicting" interest of many nations, the Euro! Under such a system, world trade and exchange rates will balance more fairly. Would you still find fault if the rest of the world economies were holding up the US as opposite from what you suggest? A positive trade deficit for the US in their dollars would indeed "prod your perception", I believe. Let us see if this great economy can stand on it's own feet with the yoke of paying it's debts from "real production"? We may indeed get an answer to this dilemma.

@FOA on forced selling in currency by mines

FOA, On what basis do you make this statement?
Carl,
On the contrary, can you name one major mine in the US that "has" bartered it's gold production? I would like to see that dynamic in action. A large mining operation, with perhaps hundreds or thousands of employees, bartering gold directly onto the market during a full blown currency crisis. Foreign exchange controls and restricted movement of currencies would be enacted in about , oh let's see, 8 hours? Just in case you don't think your government classifies gold as a currency, wait until a banking crisis begins. The truth will be on the front page of your news paper the next day. When a Gold loan crisis threatens to collapse the world dollar based banking system, do you really think trading in gold will be open and free? If yes, you should follow your spirit.

Carl, the context from where I speak is not during these tranquil times. When you need the value that gold provides, to compensate for "other loses", gold in the ground will be "quickly" held in place as "necessity" changes the rules of engagement. Your government will not confiscate gold again, as long as it retains the use of the US dollar as legal tender, but it will, in an emergency block the movement of all gold until it's value can be shared through taxes. thanks FOA

My Dear FOA, Your words touch on so many things, they make my simple head spin. I have little knowledge and must depend on logic and simple consistency with what I do know in order to find my way.
FOA, When the illusion was dropped that you could get an ounce of gold for $35, was it not the $ that reduced its price relative to gold? When the time comes that people holding paper claims on gold wish to or need to lay claim to gold, is it not likely that existing claims will "burn", as
ANOTHER puts it?

Carl,
In the real world there are two kinds of dollars, ones held by persons living within the US and ones held by persons outside the US. Under normal conditions, these same dollars can buy any item in any country through out the world. In Japan you trade them for Yen, then buy a car. In
Britain you trade them for pounds and buy a TV. One can even live in Germany and send the dollars back into the US, without conversion and buy a computer. In these "normal" times, most of these "overseas" dollars stay overseas and circulate around, constantly being exchanged for other native currencies to buy goods.

This vast block of US currency, once termed Eurodollars, floats "with value" outside the US for two reasons:

1. The "confidence" that they can be sent back into the US to buy goods. Without this ability, they are worthless as every other nation has it's own money for local trade. That is why an Englishman (as example) usually has to "exchange" his dollar holdings for pounds before buying in Britain.

2. The world CBs make a vast inter bank market in dollars because they hold them as trapped reserves. They were trapped into these holdings a long time ago when they held these dollars as "gold loans". Before they could exchange them back into gold from the US, it negated these gold loans. In order to maintain the world monetary system, once based on this contract currency, the dollar, all CBs simply continued supporting (trading) the dollar. So the vast block of overseas dollars continued to grow. With the US having trade deficits all the time, these dollar holdings
have now grown into a huge proportion.

These foreign dollars can never come back into the US to buy real goods. There are simply too many of them. We could never create enough real things to sell for these dollars. Besides, much of them are held as "assets" for savings, and not seen as earnings to spend on daily bread. So, without the above two items in play, we see why the dollar value of gold is so important, "overseas"!! The gold price in local US terms is meaningless to most here because, being a local
currency one can spend his savings on local goods.

So in real life, a war, a financial upheaval or even natural disasters (California sliding into the sea) can create a situation where the "open door" for dollars to return home to find value, could be closed! Often referred to as "external foreign exchange controls". In this light, countries that run massive balance of trade surpluses with the US (many dollars flowing into their banks from the US) must look at the dollar in terms of what it used to be, a "gold loan" contract currency. Truly, in the larger sense, for overseas dollars, the amount of gold it can buy is still it's only true value. A local in the US would not perceive this threat as the door would not be closed upon his
holdings! Now you know why a falling price of gold makes the overseas holdings of dollars "strong" in reality if not perception! We have never moved that far from Bretton Woods. In gold value, yes. In concept, no.

What does this have to do with our original discussion? A failure of the world gold market would create a massive run to unload "foreign held dollars" for anything real. Gold first, everything else second. The flood of money into the US would bring absolutely solid exchange controls upon
dollars entering the country. Every other country would respond in kind. Any form of paper gold would be discounted in price to reflect it's slim chance of having gold delivered against it. The local US paper gold market (comex), would see it's dollar price fall to but a fraction of the value that trade for physical gold would bring. No one within the US could trade any gold inside or outside the country (where the dollar price would soar) because of the money flow controls (for reasons I stated in earlier post). To bring order to the system, the government could sell it's
treasury gold to the comex at a discounted price. Or they could demand the local mines to sell gold to Comex, the only market for them to sell into.

What about the value of gold mines outside the US. They would face the same problems as they would be blocked by their local governments from selling gold for dollars. They would have to also sell in local currency.

Or all trading in gold could be blocked for a while, worldwide. Sure, there would be a huge black market. Only big gold mines are "very obvious" traders and can't move their mines to hidden places.

Carl, none of this may happen. I do not consider you as simple a thinker as your post offered. I can only say that the Giants do not need mines or the problems they may present during these troubled times. Besides, when the dust clears, physical gold will offer more than enough return for
the average person. I expect a true world free market for physical gold to be coming. We have plenty of gold already produced and circulating to trade in this arena. Only, this time the currency price will not only reflect gold's value as money, it will allow a vast liquid pool for savers to hold their long term wealth. Unfortunately, the governments will most likely be attracted to using unmined gold for national expenditures. FOA

Hey FOA - thanks for your continued presence here. That was a wonderfully cogent explanation of the contrasting views of the dollar depending upon where you sit. Given your explanation, do you think that perceptions of possible problems surrounding the y2k issue might precipitate this
'closing' of the dollar door? I posted something earlier about the BOE and their apparent attempt to become very liquid come the end of the year. It is interesting that they intend to denominate this increase in liquidity in Euros, not pounds or dollars. Is this the first public shot across the bow of the US dollar?

ET,
Thank you for the compliment. I also enjoy all of the other presentations offered here, including yours. I'm always impressed to see everyone display their own perspectives in written form, and then hint at how they intend to put those thoughts to work. Some posters are into silver, others in mining stocks and others buy gold or options. For most of us, these pronouncements not only
openly display our view of the future but indicate our actions and how it will impact out wealth to a great extent.

I have often found that people will "bet" a great deal of their money to make a return. However, most never would "place" as much money in an effort to maintain their "wealth". This concept has grown right along with the current global expansion of the last 50 years or so. It's
easy to understand, because seldom does the world experience massive wealth destruction. Consequently, in those few times that this occurs, everyone is usually "betting" on a percentage return "on their wealth" not "a return of their wealth". They are caught in a once in a thousand year change, just as may befall the world from Y2K. If something is unseen over several lifetimes, it cannot happen, right? The constant successful repeat of an economic function creates a "common belief" among people groups that is hard to refuse.

If Another has not read the minds and actions of leaders correctly and I am completely wrong, I'm not going to increase my wealth very much. However, if the life cycle of our world monetary system is coming to an end, those that are expecting a repeat of the past will lose a great deal.
Even those that position themselves in expectation of similar "currency crisis" as in the past will lose. A line of thinking I have presented here recently.

Yet, for me to actually "lose" wealth, the entire history of human nature would have to be repealed. Gold would be pushed into the background as everyone made good on their debts. This is why I "place" my wealth in the "no return on investment" position. Gold rose 32% during the 1929 contraction, while most people lost "everything. Even though that gain was not a return from investment, it was an increase in value from the falling price of everything else.

There are truly many financial giants that currently walk this earth. Some "bet" on silver, some "bet" on gold, but most of them all position these "bets" to function within the framework of this present system. The giants I follow have "placed" a good portion of their wealth in a position for change.

Truly, there is so much more in life than loss or gain. We gather here to learn, to understand and share our perspectives in this changing world.

Yes, ET,
The BOE is sliding into the Euro arena as we speak. They cannot stand on both sides of the fence. Like it or not, the IMF/dollar and the london gold market that gives it value are failing. They sold their gold to back up a few survivor banks for entry into the EMU. The signal is loud and clear, England is NOT running to the Euro, they are running "FROM" the dollar! No wonder oil money is leaving London. I don't care what the odds are, the British pound is history and
Michael K. is going to owe me one US dollar! With all his millions of tons of gold, I'm sure he can afford it! (smile) FOA

FOA,

A fine and magnificent post - very clearly stated, and it contributed to a shift in my "understanding curve", as opposed to mere movement along the curve. One quick caveat: Does not a portion of the $US value and importance stem, not merely from the US goods it can buy, but from the US'
political stability, the rule of law, advanced securities regulation, fair treatment of foreign investors, immunity from direct military attack, etc. - in sense, is not the role and value of the $US based partly on the public sector or international relations equivalent of the accounting entry "goodwill"? Alternatively, could not economic/ political/military stability and the rule of law, etc., be
conceptualized as a US "export" which can be contra-accounted against the US trade deficit?

canamami,
Thank you. I have to say yes to all that you pointed out. But we have to acknowledge that the world has always functioned with these problems. There has always been a "strong country" where people held wealth. The problem is in the question: "what price am I paying for all of this?"
Conversely, of what value are these attributes if a crisis blocks my use of the "strong nations" money? Also, why do we have to hold dollars to obtain these benefits? Why not just sell us the gold? We can always sell the gold back to the US for dollars, can we not? Are we left to assume that no other country or group of countries could perform this same function? Indeed, the early US was also looked at as a "ragtag", "rebel" country, that could not be trusted with "my money". Besides, they didn't honor their gold loans at $35. How do I know when the "goodwill" will not be dishonored also?
canamami, I am American and to war I would go if needed. But these are real views that must be factored in, if we are to understand the unfolding problem.

Unknown Economist #33 (7/18/99; 21:15:29MDT - Msg ID:9143)
Gold is a Commodity-Currency is Labor

Mr. Economist,
Your words and my comments:

------First , Gold is a Commodity, and it always has been. It has had its ups and downs for literally thousands of years. As has silver, copper, corn, wheat, meat, & even water.--------

Agree. In addition, gold is also money. Fact: If you review history, it will show that gold has been money for over 90% of the time span that humans have used money.

------ Currency is not a commodity. ---------

Agree. Facts will also indicate that currencies have been used as receipts or "contract currencies" for precious metals during the majority of their existence.

------(currency) It can be in many forms, yet it is always the same, it is Labor. Currency is 'shorthand' for service rendered. It is something accepted by at least two persons toaid in exchange of wanted commodities. I serve you, you pay me, I trade it for what I need. If I buy more than I need , then I have 'stored my labor'. It could be a barrel of oil or anything.-------

Agree. What you have described above is also equally applied to gold. As I pointed out in the first item, gold has been used in this very application far longer than any currency has. It is a tribute to the ingenuity of the human race to equate the use of "currency receipts for gold" in this
same fashion. It promoted the ease of commerce and speed of settlement. It is to the disgrace of dignity that governments embarked upon using currency, by itself as a receipt for labor. If not for the ages old cheating nature of mankind, it could have worked.

---------If you are a trader, a Real Trader, you do not become attached to any commodity in an emotional way. The commodity will gain or lose value in only way anything gains in value, by the pressures of supply and demand.------------

Agree. Because you are a "real trader", you must certainly know that anything can be traded if and only if it can be measured accurately. Man can equate no value to anything without a constant rule of measurement. Being bound to earthly things, said measurements can only be in the form of
real things to be honest. We all agree, that an item of infinite supply, as a dollar created in an electronic charge, could never represent labor in an unemotional way! Truly, gold has a supply and demand, while the modern dollar is like the air of your breath. Always expanding and contracting.

-----------This year, Gold is in a downturn. Despite exciting reports of 'coin shop gold sales' it is
continuing to be priced lower because of lower demand and higher supply than what is sought in the world marketplaces. Period.--------

No, a "True Trader" would recognize that it is the dollar that is in an "upturn"! The emotions of traders can play tricks on their judgment. Tulips were once in high demand yet supply was infinite. Double Period

-------Despite all the distress expressed by many here , despite the anger felt for the Bank of England or the Swiss Nation itself, the hate felt for the 'short-sellers', whoever these dastardly persons may be, and the pleading for help to support the price of gold, the Truth is that gold is
Not In Favor and the short-sellers are the Real Traders. If you held a commodity, any commodity, and its value was sliding with little let-up, then you would be a fool to buy more! As a horse race progresses and your horse is losing ground yard by yard, do you bet it to win or to lose?---

--------------and the rest of your post----------

As Mr. Another said, "time will prove all things".
As I say, "Your experience with life has but only time to make wisdom sing"

------------If America's Wealth Bubble Bursts


By Kevin Phillips Los Angeles Times Service

WASHINGTON - The United States is approaching the millennium with a lotus-eating culture and e.commerce that some insist have banished the bad old business downturn. But what if it is actually living in its first major example of an aging economic cycle on the financial steroids of a ''wealth
effect''?

The next business cycle and politics could easily bring the reverse of today's giddiness: an ''unwealth effect'' in which consumer spending contracts as paper affluence shrinks.-----------------------

Buena Fe,
I'm glad it's clear to you. I'm also happy that you are able to grasp it without having any idea who myself or Another are. It's really a very simple message tangled up in a giant web of political cross currents.

There is only one investment direction anyone should have been able to pull from all of these posts. Buy as much physical gold, in your possession, as is prudent for your finances. In addition, Another always presented it in a way that should have signaled, "let the percentage of gold be in
proportion to your education of the current gold market dynamics"!

Also, people who buy gold in small amounts, will probably always be able to find physical at local dealers of extremely high moral standards (USAGOLD as Example). The ethics is important because the coming crisis will prompt many players to charge exorbitant fees to unsuspecting clients. Run from any company that offers high pressure sales people pushing leveraged plays. You have most likely seen their people posting on other web sites.

I have a further drum to beat about this, but will offer it later after more commentary.

Wow, FOA, I'm awestruck by your comment:
"We all agree, that an item of infinite supply, as a dollar created in an electronic charge, could never represent labor in an unemotional way."
Exceptionally well put! A week ago I was hold a discussion with various posters about the meaning of "$17." Aragorn had the last word with various comments and revealing questions that pretty much put the wraps on the issue in my mind. (Come to think of it, I don't think I ever said "thanks for the input, Big guy," so this will have to serve in its stead.)
I think your comment opens the next chapter. Not only must we be concerned whether this particular "$17" is an electronic counterfeit, but we must always contend with the emotional element that at any time could alter its prevailing sentiment to conclude that even non-counterfeit
dollars are bogus by the very nature of the government's willful and indiscriminant creation of them.

Aristotle,
And a WOW back to you for expanding on this item. We are getting right into it here. It isn't just confidence that counts, "credibility" from past performance is a "concrete" fact that haunts foreign dollar holders like the "Blair Witch Project"!

The "real" default on gold in 1971, followed up with a confirmation of that action with the "Jamaica Accords" begs the question, can it happen again? What would stop the IMF/dollar group from defaulting all present gold loans and trading contracts? It's obvious to everyone now that there isn't enough gold to satisfy all the claims. Are we headed into the same circumstances that lead to 71? If not gold, what about the pound? If they are running from the dollar, into the Euro, they have to change a lot of valuation to make this fit as MK points out. Changes that will impact my English holdings. In addition, if England is bailing, what do they know that I don't?

The same holds true for the dollar. If the American economy, that is supporting the world currency system, begins to slump, as a preemptive measure, they will "HAVE" to devalue the dollar. Against what? You got it, the Yen (fact in progress) and the Euro (fact in progress)! Guess
what else will be caught up in this, "GOLD"! A fact that if it is in progress, will bring the need for some big time bailing out of major banks! SteveH, perhaps this is what all the "collateral eligibility" increases is all about. Under cover of Y2K (still a real threat) the new credit is readied for other purposes.

As I have (only recently) said many times, Another guided me to the point that the entire gold market may fail on this move. That's because it's unlike the circumstances of the 70s and 80s. One person on this forum finds this to be "not responsible thinking". On the contrary, if it does
take place, some "simple people" may take massive loses as this plays out. It may not, but it's a huge risk to take. A gold only position may make this trip a lot easier to weather. We "are" going to see!! FOA

FOA, why the full-court press now? You must feel we are close? Certainly, the GATA release below'shows a move is immanent but why would it be different this time than all other failed gold rallys? After all, last time we got the BOE announcement. What this time?
What is it that Mr. Another senses from his fellow world leaders that tells him that 1999/2000 is the possible last notch in the dollar belt? Why now?

SteveH,
First I want to thank you for making this statement in your:

SteveH (8/2/99; 20:52:53MDT - Msg ID:10182) "The message is important, whether they are 100% correct or just 25% correct."

This may offend some, but this drum must be pounded home.

In the past, so many writers have come down hard on me for posting Another's Thoughts. Yet, they don't even examine their own writings and the agenda it pushes. Be it options, silver, mines, or gold options, it's always the same story to other investors:
"you can't just lay there and hold gold! Out of the investment capital you have put only a tiny bit in physical gold, then get a great return in all of these other paper gold products. At the very least, if paper won't do, buy silver"

If these thinkers are being responsible to readers "of lesser knowledge" why don't they ever talk about the loses these item can and have recently produced? Why does the "average reader" have to make this "good" return on this portion of their insurance holdings. Their matra is almost
like the CBs saying they must make a return on their citizens most sacred gold reserves!

Most of the mine bulls have been talking and trading these items all the way down over the last many months. Some readers that had decided to hold gold instead, have a loss to show, true. But, they still hold metal that can't go to zero as some companies have. I remember some friends
plowing big bucks, on leverage into ABX and laughing at others for buying anything else.
"I don't mess with the foolish stuff, they said".

Almost every one of them took far bigger loses than they thought. From a mine "fully hedged", they even lost more in percentage than gold bullion! So much for "brains"!

Each step down the slippery hill of this crisis, they said,
"oh no don't buy gold at these cheap levels, the mines have fallen even further and present an even greater value".

Today, gold in the $250 to $280 range is still considered crazy to consider! The mines are still cheaper they say, and
look at those mine options? Then, if someone says gold could fall further (destroying some mines) before it spikes, the "stockers" say, "how could you be so nuts as to cause these poor people to miss out on the greatest opportunity to buy holes in the ground?"

Well, people, the CRB is going up, oil has doubled, crisis is in the air and gold?

A think persons might, just might, consider that the gold market itself is failing. And, worldwide, on the sidelines, people may be taking gold where they can get it. And, yes, as Carl says, the mines may find a way to work around it. But, it's a "total washout" if they can't! What percentage of risk do we place on that?

Do we wait for "responsible", "professional" conformation before even considering this possibility. Remember, the professional "smart money", "money too smart to buy physical gold like the average people", has been trading in and out of leveraged paper and mine stocks "ALL THE WAY DOWN"!!!

Yes the paper investments may explode. I only point out that any explosion will be in proportion to the risk presently in this market. If one has risk capitol, Gold Fields (thanks MK) would be the one. As for silver, they killed the Hunt brothers and millions of simple investors in the last run of that thing. And they have killed it several times in between. This time, I think they will do it long before it ever gets to that extreme. As Another said, gold is presently the most important money in the world. This should make it important to you.

Steve, "Why the full-court press now?" Not now, but a month or so ago, around $280. The action was heating up then so I didn't wait for any lower. Delivery could have been a problem then and it could be even more of a problem now? For me, it makes little difference from here on out. For others, it's going to make a great difference.

I'll be away for a while. FOA

Response
Bill, The Scot, & Stranger,
As The Unknown Economist recently stated, '...let's not complicate the issue ...'
Gold is either going to go up or its going to go down. I believe Watcher and I are in the same school, that is, gold has an inverse relationship to money. If stocks, dollars, etc. (boom) gold will go down, if they bust, gold goes up.
I have 'poised' myself (cash) to enter into gold very quickly (15 minutes) if Y2K rears its ugly head. I'm, in general terms, 80% cash, 10% PM's, 10% resource.

Canuck,
I'm going to make several posts now. Please read all of them as together.

I would like to comment on your post. Most people in this era live their lives with little fear of change. As "The Unknown Economist" puts it, we are way too complicated. Just keep it simple! I agree. The majority of us can and do drive down the highway without seat belts. If we see to
many wrecks, then it's time to buckle up. On a golf course, don't worry about lightning. Get off the green only after several people have been hit, close by!

Most of the world functions in this way. Be it in private life or business, the perception is that we can rearrange our strategy "IF" things start to look bad. The reason we build on this mindset is because the odds are in our favor. Through out time, seldom do events turn so radically against us that we cannot dive for cover before all is lost.

This is the "steady as we go", "let's not go overboard", "play the odds of recent history to your favor" thinking that perhaps Stranger and several others here promote, regarding gold. It could be a good bet. But, if you follow the reasoning offered by myself, based upon the thinking of
Another, we could be about to make one of those "once in several centuries changes".

When things do change to this degree, history has shown that it's always these "regular simple thinking" people that get ground up, "unmercifully"! Canuck, you are "'poised' (cash) to enter into gold very quickly (15 minutes)". That's fine, but a "fantastic financial crisis" may, this time, lock up the very system you use to function in. Your order may book in 5 minutes, but if the other side of your deal can't close, you will receive nothing! During these few times that events reverse "big time major on a world class scale", everybody holds onto what is considered "most dear". You will hear this often: " Yea, I owe you 5,000 barrels of oil. Yes, I have it, but it's going somewhere else because your deal with me is not as important as my deal with this other guy. He has something I need more, so get in line and kill me or sue me! I'm bankrupt anyway!" This is the way business dealings are resolved during war, natural disasters and major international disputes. Your, so called "lightning fast trade", is killed by a much larger breakdown involving much larger players.

Truly, I don't expect most people to change from this current line of thinking that embraces a "western style" of secure economics. If they did, it would negate thousands of years of natural human behavior. Most of the time, people will continue to play with paper contracts right up to and during the "burning of Roam". The Hunts thought they had "big" oil in Libya. They even borrowed against those assets as banks clamored to lend against these secure in ground holdings. Right up to the last day, traders booked contracts against delivery of those producing wells. Then, in a split second, it was nationalized. All gone! The same will be seen with gold stocks one day. Traders will buy them right down to .05, and still say, "I know it will come back with the demand for gold because the asset value is in the ground". Heard this before Carl? Gold goes from $100 to $10,000 during the crisis, and someone bigger (the local government?) then the shareholders says:

"Yes, I have it, but it's going somewhere else because your deal with me is not as important as my deal with this other guy. He has something I need more, so get in line and kill me or sue me!"

None of this is anything new. It's just that most "westerners" haven't been defaulted on recently, in a big way. Think about it. FOA

Hey FOA - thanks for your response. Yes, as you have probably been able to tell I am certainly concerned about the return of my wealth. It is an easy decision. Your point about current 'bets' having to have the current framework to work is well taken.I think what few realize today is that the current framework is subject to the same market forces as any other. The dollar framework must compete with other forms of money. To think otherwise one would have to take a very, very short view of economic history. A 'bet' on one system exclusive of all others is actually a very risky venture. Not only must the 'bet' in the system produce a return to be successful but the system itself must remain successful. A two part failure here could cause one to lose not only the 'bet' but one's total savings if all is denominated in the system's units.
Too risky for me. I don't think one can be too conservative at this point in time. Thanks for all your thoughts, FOA. They are always most enlightening.

Sparks Fly Over GOLD Pegged At $200.
http://www.nationalpost.com
This article proves the tremendous tug of war that is going on to have two extreme views like this.It proves something is terribly wrong with GOLD!
I have to come back to F.O.A comments about how he disagrees with Another over the Market imploding or Exploding. It seems even the experts can't decide either way it should be very interesting to watch. Another says implode, F.O.A says explode, in my simple and humble understanding of the events to be played out.


GT,
Yes, I got hit right between the eyes when Another put this reasoning to me. Anyone that does not have a firm grasp of this "new gold market" is going to need a lot of guts and conviction to continue to hold even physical gold as this plays out. It could go either way, but the downside will
hammer the current "secure trade and paper mentality" of most Americans. (see my last post to
Canuck)
Most traders / investors are just looking for a little new inflation or some type of Y2K disruption to bring gold (and gold stocks) up. The process of moving away from the current gold market to a mostly world physical market could have the effect of driving down the quotes of London gold. Because, every physical dealer and trader buys from someone "upstream" from himself, we must look to the ultimate creators of the "gold price" to see how it's made. At the very top of the food chain, are all the menders of the LBMA, most of the major banks of the world. Practically all of their price setting function revolves around the paper trading of "allocated or unallocated" bullion accounts and the cash settlement of future delivery contracts. All marked to the market and settled in dollars. If the world begins to move away from "investing in gold" using dollar settlement and towards outright physical delivery (as represented by vault certificates) settled in, say Euros???? I think such a process will bring a shrinking liquidity into the dollar gold market along with lower quotes for "contract gold". Just as one bids the price of bonds down from $1,000 par to say, $300, not because the yield isn't good, but because the principal may never be paid.

Because "this new gold market" operates in a kind of parallel universe, most "western traders" will not see the dynamic at work. It will appear on their computer screens as falling gold prices on the world dollar market and increasing premiums on physical gold. If the London price is $100, and your dealer sells it at $650, the press will say that the premiums on coins have risen to $550 because of gold horders (or something to that effect). It will come across that anyone that buys gold at $650 is getting "ripped off" (english pronouncement) because everyone knows that the
true gold price is set in london at $100. This is the arena that the mines may get dragged into. Forced by the bullion banks to sell into London in much the same way they forced NEM to hedge. Today, LBMA controls most of the world mines. Believe it!

So, I hope this is understandable? FOA

IMF gold sale uncertainty priced in, dealers say
http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/990805/wr.html
So essentially, if by some miracle the IMF sale were to be approved, there would be no further slide in price. But if the official word came that the sale would not occur, a big rebound mayhap...?
"Leach, a Republican from Iowa, said a number of alternatives cropped up at the meeting, among them the idea of revaluing IMF gold closer to market prices to give the institution more assets with which to furnish debt relief."
If they were to officially mark the gold to market price, they essentially throw in the towel on the current system as we know it, right? The BIS- (and euro-)type system prevails. Right?
ANOTHER or FOA, do you have a wise word or two on this? Anyone else?

TC,
A lot of people read your items. Thanks for posting them along with your comments!

This is a perception everyone may miss, but, if the IMF gold "doesn't" come to market, it would further damage the LBMA paper system and force a further lowering of bids on the world gold market. See my last several posts, especially the one to Golden Truth.

A loss of gold backing begs the question: "why do I bid par for London gold is it may not be backed with full physical delivery"? So, to the American investor, he just sees a further confusing and conflicting event as the world gold price falls as the Swiss, IMF and perhaps BOE sales are
withdrawn!

Can we now envision why a new physical market for gold priced in Euros may evolve?

natural gas conversion
Cavan Man, Koan and all those who factor in natural gas as a competitor to OPEC. For natural gas to compete with oil above $20 per barrel is feasible. However the capital outlay
to build refineries to produce any meaningful quantity would be tremendous. Suppose OPEC raised the price of oil to $50 per barrel today. Eureka! We now start building refineries all over the world. Pilot plants first to perfect the technology, then plan for full factory construction and finally huge production into storage tanks for delivery into the market at a profit margin. Years of work, billions of dollars in capital outlay and the dream of a quick payoff. In this dream there is a $30 per barrel profit.
OPEC drops the price to $19 per barrel. Natural gas conversion plants operate at a loss, can't service their debt and go bankrupt.
IMHO natural gas conversion will not take place until the supply of oil is such that it cannot possibly drop below the conversion costs. Decades away.

Hello Clint H.,
Thank you very much for posting that. Your thoughts present the world in the viewpoint of someone "in the business". Not someone trying to project from a university desk.

A lot of people got cleaned out in the last oil runup and fall down. The average citizen only looks at the mechanics of BTU comparisons, then jumps to the conclusion that "we are saved from our sins" by this law of physics! A joke on the public, indeed.

It should be clear, by now that the supply of oil to the marketplace was never based on the amount of oil that could come from the ground. Politics and international money values have everything to do with how oil is sold. And these attributes are in a state of constant flux! They don't control the amount of oil, rather the value of oil.
After all these years and an actual hot war in the middle east, the oil price never went up and stayed up in dollars. As WWC #10461 points out , tanks are as full as ever. Now, suddenly right after the EMU, the price of oil starts rising, as it pulls up the Euro! At the same time, the gold market is sliding into a crisis that, as Mr. Turk wisely observes, has never been seen before?

While many wait for the oil price to come down from "competition" and "the Euro to sink because it could never work", the world reserve currency is being abandoned right before their eyes!

Stay right here at USAGOLD, where Mr. Michael Kosares is only a quick phone call away! The coming events are going to open some closed minds as they reverse the actions of many
investors. It will be poured out, a little at a time until the knowledge glass is full.

" I also believe that each of these currencies will be linked in some with gold. The euro serves as a prototype for the currency of the future. Stretching out the implications of such an international exchange rate system, gold owners who have assiduously exchanged dollars for hard metal over the years will be major beneficiaries of such a system. The dollar price of gold would have to be substantially higher than what it is today to make the reserve system workable, just as a much higher price than $35 was necessary to make the post-Bretton Woods floating exchange rate system work."



Michael,
Good report. I agree, In some way, gold will have to be brought back into the money system. Only, the current gold market will have to die first. That process could take London gold way up or way down. It's taking longer than I thought to play out, but it's starting to crack now. This
should get real interesting! FOA

Quabbin, Your link to this story is indeed a must read. Especially the one part I post below. As I pointed out in my posts a few days ago, the failure to deliver future sales by BOE, IMF or the Swiss could further drive confidence in this market to new lows. The result of "making new confidence lows" would be seen in the public as a withdrawal of bids for gold using LBMA menders. As such, the present world gold price making mechanism would be creating new lows in the gold price you follow, even as demand for real bullion soars "off market". A perplexing situation, indeed as most everyone muse sell their gold production and holdings into the paper "derivatives" markets using london prices.

To ALL: Before you discount that fact, find me someone that doesn't, then we talk.

A new gold market to be created soon, using Euro settlement and backed with oil demand. Believe it! FOA

Source: The Daily Telegraph London
A concern of his at home must be the future of the London market. As the world's biggest market in gold bullion, it contributes to the critical mass of financial services on which the City must depend. For historic and operational reasons, this market has always been close to the Bank of
England. Now it knows that there will be a SALE sign at the Bank until further notice. Its customers know that, too, and so do its competitors. Gold no longer comes to this country on the Union-Castle liners, and the market could go anywhere. Mr George, who understands the ways of markets, can work that out for himself. No wonder he winced when he was told to put up the SALE sign.--------------------

It seems the more you want something the less likely it is to happen. We know gold will ultimately rise. We know that FOA believes it will rise soon enough but we don't know when. Everyone's clock ticks differently. Further, it is becoming a sad affair of "us or them at this point." In other words, why is it that for us to benefit from gold's rise, those who hold gold back would suffer the most and they hold the purse strings? That is what is seems to boiling down to. I feel Bill Murphy's frustration. It isn't right that it has to be this way. But it sure seems as though it is turning out that way. And, that just isn't
fair, is it? Life is all about win-win, not we loose-they win. How can it have come this far? It is if we all feel guilty for wanting our investments to rise, knowing more everyday that for them to do that means a greater and greater chance of financial collapse. Something not right about that.


Steve, (just thinking):
I wouldn't think of it in quite those terms. Gold is an international savings account that spans every generation through out history. Even the use of currency as a warehouse receipt for gold is a short lived experience compared to gold. Further along, compared to the time line of gold, the
use of paper currency "by itself" is an experiment of this current era only. The young people that have grown up during this period can not be blamed for seeing little use for gold. The only reason they continue to follow this current paper trend is the lack of major loses from currency
destruction. No one ever forgets the impact of a "money wipeout" upon their life's savings. Once experienced, the discussion once again returns back to the "damming factors" of unbacked money use.
When we follow the politics of world finance, it becomes clear that the "present system" players are only fighting to keep what they have. This "present system" inflates their portfolios with "fictional values" that would not exist outside government fiat currencies. Yet they believe these assets were well deserved rewards, received from implementing prudent trading practices. The ideals of gold do not rob world investors of their holdings, rather it correctly denominates these assets at much lower values. It's like them using an unrigged scale to weigh the beef. It
shows them as having 10 lbs instead of the 100 lbs they really think they had. In this light we should understand that they (world traders) don't lose in the transition. They didn't have the extra 90lbs in the first place so why must we think someone is taking a hit?

So, will the use of gold take down the system? No! The "present system" will be "taken down" by the very same players that participate in it. Their own human nature will drive them to dump their 100lbs before it's weighed on a true scale. Recent history is full of examples of people
destroying their own paper currencies in a race to offload it on someone else before it's weighed. "Quickly now, exchange your currency to the next guy so he takes the loss!" Such is life.

oil thing
More thoughts on this oil question. I think, and someone correct me if am wrong, the oil industry - US, Japan and Europe- is working feverishly to perfect the technology and reduce costs with regard to coverting natural gas to oil products. It is my understanding that this is a big deal, as
there is so much gas, and it would reduce the reliance on the middle east - of course that begs the question would the middle east decide to make as much as they can now before the technology is perfected.

Hello Koan (just thinking),
Your words and my thoughts:

------US, Japan and Europe- is working feverishly to perfect the technology and reduce costs with regard to coverting natural gas to oil products.------

I don't think feverishly is a good term. Yes, they are working on it, but they are light years away from making it competitive. Any technology improvements would have to also price in the infrastructure to provide such a product to the marketplace. Present innovations would require $50+ oil to even get started. Besides, the US already has tons of natural gas yet it is still bottled up in political state to state regulations. It's already competitive in some applications, as is and no one is switching. Politics plays as big a part in energy as it does in money. It seems that no matter how much we improve our physical processes, the greed of people always get in the way.

----------of course that begs the question would the middle east decide to make as much as they can now before the technology is perfected.---------

The US was the very first to implement price controls on oil to prevent it from falling too far. Have you read Aristotle's work about the "TRC"? The oil producers were never worried about the US coming up with innovations that would drive the price of oil down. Our (US) own political
interest will always control the price of anything that would jeopardize national security. Low internal energy prices in the US would force foreign oil to switch settlement currencies and then deliver oil very, very cheaply. The resulting domestic inflation from a new reserve currency would cause the local US producers to become massively noncompetitive! You see, governments can and have manipulated technological advances just as much as they do currencies. That is the Human factor that blocks your "brave new world" of human advances. My friend, we are quick to steal from each other!

To Another from Yukon Gold (YGM)
By E-mail:
Dear Another: To keep this brief please let me join many others in thanking you for all of your time taken to share your vast knowledge and understanding of these interesting times and their relationship to Gold. My education grows daily thanks to you and many others. As a Yukon Gold Miner (YGM) who became pro-active in an attempt to fight gold price manipulation thru GATA,I now find myself trying to relax and go with the flow and flux of world events and rest assured, safe in the knowledge that I own many miles of Gold bearing river beds. (Placer Gold Claims) Also I have the equipment needed to mine at any time.
** So now my question to you is-- Does Government view this Gold on my claims as a future asset??** I must also state that Gov't meddling and a never-ending continuous flow of new and cost restrictive not to mention ridiculous laws and regulations come out of Ottawa (fed gov't) with a net result of hampering the operations of all placer mining here in Canada. The favourite avenue to restrict is thru environmental laws. It almost seems as tho our Federal Goverment wants all placer operations to fail thru regulation.
Do you, from where you sit think the days of freely being able to mine Gold (primarily small scale)by individuals is at risk??
Thanks for taking the time to read this:
Sincerely: YGM (worried)!!

Mr. YGM,
All legal tender is owned by your state. Government money is yours for the use only. It be the not legal act to destroy treasury dollar notes, yes? As private citizen, your ownership is in what these notes may purchase, not the notes. When gold was the "tender" of your country, the
government did have right to "repossess" it's "tender", where ever it be.

Today, gold is not your money, therefore, gold in ground is asset, most private of citizen. If America does make gold "Legal Tender" again, gold in hand would remain "in hand" as money. But, gold production from ground must be sold to state. As such, the profit from production of money, that was once the paper production and ownership of treasury, would again return to treasury.

A problem for the thinker of western thought. If government did take gold from foreign dollar holders, it, by nature, may take gold from you, coin it and then pay you the wage. These coins in return, not be the world price of gold. If one could move mine to place of safety, perhaps this fate
is escaped.

Thank You

Golden Truth, reading yur post and "just thinking":

Golden Truth (08/09/99; 14:47:03MDT - Msg ID:10756)
TO F.O.A, MSG I.D: 10737
I agree that Confidence or "lack of" could drive the GOLD to new lows. If i understand this correctly? Are you saying that who would want to buy "Paper GOLD" if ther is no physical GOLD to back it up? There for the paper price drops which then creates this "invented" World spot price for GOLD?
I had this thought pop into my mind just now about "Cheese Cake" It goes something like this "the price of cheesecake is dropping because they say no one is buying, I say it is dropping because many are buying" ANOTHER?

GT,
The Cheese Cake thing came when others lost the trend of Another's Thoughts. Some time back (perhaps way back) he offered something to the effect that "gold is falling in price because so many investors are buying it". This was a real lost effort on some readers that didn't understand the full dynamic of the lending business. If I remember right, in that time the LBMA and the BIS both wanted gold to continue trending down. Yes, they were working together, but for different purposes and different final results. World investors were buying physical gold in volume, so these
government entities pushed even further into lending to free up more physical from private holders. It had the effect of lowering gold's market price even as more buyers emerged. No one could understand it then as the full manipulation story was still mostly hidden. Another was talking to a larger audience then and didn't worry that a few didn't grasp it.

Today, the dynamic has changed with the now obvious differences of intentions between the factions that are controlling gold. The Dollar/IMF/LBMA group are clearly in trouble as their portions of the lending business is much larger and in need of a constant new supply of CB vault
guarantees. They were hung out to dry after the Euro birth and the Euro/BIS people blocked all further gold sales. A political double cross? We could talk for hours about this! (before you go any further, I hope you have read my last dozen or so posts) Anyway; the gold price as we know it, is created by the LBMA. Without a further supply of CB lent/leased gold or outright sales to Bullion Merchant members (BOE sale), most of the fractional reserve dollar gold loans cannot be closed with bullion. We are seeing the beginnings of this effect in the current rise of lease rates. This is the reason I urged the purchase and delivery of physical gold, several months ago. If you search my posts, I offered that major players were "grabbing the gold and running like mad".

"Another" counseled later that the gold market, as we know it was in danger of failing. In this case, failing means less and less major players are offering bids for future paper in the top tier markets because the gold can't be supplied. This loss of bids allows the paper price to fall further as present paper holders also attempt to sell. This is the "EXACT" reason that gold does not respond to the major financial events of today! Believe it! Local downstream physical dealers, because they use the Comex and LBMA paper market as a price creator, continue to sell gold at lower prices even as buyers come in droves. This brings me to MKs question of physical supply. I get to it in another post.

SteveH offered a very good timeline of these events on the Gold Eagle site. See the link above.

We are headed directly into a storm of events that are being created by the downfall of the dollar as a reserve currency. Gandalf the White wanted to know when? The BIS is letting the dollar slide down a slope it was going down anyway. So my answer is: Any day, my friend, any
day. FOA

Aragorn III (8/11/99; 2:39:01MDT - Msg ID:10880)
Coming to terms with the dollar and with money (a continuation from earlier)
My good friend Aristotle has relayed to you much of the modern story. (Where has he been these days?) I am pleased it met with acknowledgements regarding its assistance, and would like to continue with perhaps some additional background for assistance to some in the understanding of money. Please forgive me the many oversights for which haste may have to play the fall guy. As later time allows, I shall attempt to repair what is necessary, but meanwhile this should help continue our dialog on these matters.

This is where we left off from before, more or less... (08/08/99; 17:19:07MDT - Msg ID:10664)
"...It should be obvious by the nature of our topic (money) that our conversation is focused on tomorrow, in addition to today. Were we to be truly concerned about today only, we would instead discuss whether our needs of food, clothing, and shelter had been adequately met, we would not speak of money. To speak of money is to speak of today's confidence in our ability of meeting tomorrow's needs."

A currency with an unknown expiration date is arguably of limited use for the role we expect our money to play...to hold its value within acceptable limits of fluctuation based on normal market pressures and thereby successfully fulfill its ultimate destiny to be spent as a medium of exchange for our future needs (food, clothing, shelter, hardware, medicine, etc.). No one wants to be the one left holding the bag when the purchasing value drops out the bottom.

Prior to 1971 the dollar was truly money (gold standard defined the dollar as gold) in the international economy, freely convertible with gold, with an equivalency of 1 oz. @ $35 -- FIXED, no questions asked! (Though it is fair to say there was squawking from time to time when overseas paper came home for redemption). Unfortunately, the U.S. had painted itself into a corner and was trapped. Here is how it happened.

Prior to 1933 the U.S. was on a gold standard domestically, also, at which time the equivalency was 1 oz. @ $20.67 -- fixed, no questions asked. A bank would readily exchange paper currency for the equivalent gold currency on demand. There was a general confidence in the banking institutions, and people were content to use their paper dollar equivalents, and further, were content to let their deposits remain in the bank. Fractional reserve lending privileges allowed banks to expand the money supply--YES...even while on a fixed gold standard! As long as not everyone together would choose to withdraw their money and convert the paper proxies for the gold dollars, this fractional reserve lending privilege did not cause any apparent problems. Did prices stay reasonable as the dollar still appeared "good as gold"? I give you... The Roaring Twenties! When the attendant stock market bubble popped in 1929, the financial system, and much necessary confidence began to unravel, and the bank run became a probationary event for the Olympics. In 1929, 659 banks failed. In 1930, 1352 banks failed. In 1931, 2294 banks failed. Late 1932 and early 1933 witnessed this trend swell to envelop not small or isolated banks alone anymore, but entire communities and statewide banking institutions. (I will tell you that by 1933's end, nearly half of U.S. banks had disappeared...such is the "privilege" of issuing excessive claims on money that cannot be backed through this fractional reserve system!)

You can see why the Roosevelt Executive Order of a bank holiday effective March 6, 1933 was something other than a trip to the beach. In this year, 4004 banks failed, or else were found to be unfit to reopen at the end of the "holiday". In the following year, only 62 failed. Why? Because as you already know, it was at this point that President Roosevelt took the money (gold) out of the domestic dollar, and it should be obvious to us all that a crippling bank run is no longer a threat when a bank need not be held to deliver real money. It could easily deliver the ledger numbers endlessly in portable paper form. A bank run becomes meaningless because the people are not at risk of being cheated by arriving too late, they have all already been cheated 100% in full! The government knew international parties would not fall for such trickery, so the gold convertibility was maintained, but only after defaulting on the paper dollars they held by redefining their equivalency to 1 oz. @ $35 (as was maintained from this point until the Second World War, and reaffirmed at Bretton Woods until 1971).

With domestic U.S. companies and citizens now subject to the inflationary dollar supply through fractional reserve lending, and a new dollar that even with the best confidence was not as "good as gold" within the U.S. borders, the anticipated effect of higher wages and higher prices was soon to follow. Here is the trap we fashioned for ourselves. The U.S. dollar would easily buy overseas products, as simple math and occasional "confidence reassurances" (by testing the success of convertibility) proved that to be paid $35 was truly to be paid one ounce of gold. Foreign goods were then priced accordingly, and imports flowed to American shores in due course as we spent down our national gold savings. And what of our balance of trade...the exports?

Domestically, with higher wages and prices reflecting a paper dollar rather than a gold dollar, American goods were not a bargain to foreign shoppers. The dollar itself (gold) was the best deal they could get from America in exchange for their own goods, and this money would then be used to shop where a gold dollar was properly held in value...anywhere but America! U.S. imports rose and exports fell against each other until the risk of gold exhaustion caused President Nixon to end international convertibility in 1971. This was essentially a world-scale replay of the 1933 Roosevelt action for the same reason...too many claims had been created on the gold money, and when the confidence for convertibility eroded to bring about a "bank run", the paper system failed to continue in its former manifestation. In the 1930's, gold was made available only outside the U.S. and the paper "price" rose from $20.67 to $35...a 70% increase. In 1971, the paper currencies lost their attachment to real money everywhere else in the world, and gold found a paper "price" in the many hundreds. So ended a time period of an fixed notion of a dollar's value.

Today, the international need for long-term reliable money still exists. Only gold can play that role to satisfaction. Speculators aside, the paper gold trade (as largely explained in Aristotle's work--which can be found at the Hall of Fame link atop this page--in the event you are newly arrived to our Round Table) has functioned as a much needed currency of gold in a fashion very similar to that just described for the dollar during the Roaring Twenties...albeit with a floating dollar attachment rather than a fixed one. The paper gold is received and held as a contract that specifies a right to gold delivery, perhaps some as a lump sum, perhaps as installments. (Contracts can be written so many ways!) The key parallel, and purpose of this post is to show you that this works only as long as confidence is retained, and that excessive issues of claims has not jeopardized the real ability to get gold without being the one left holding the bag of paper gold when the bottom drops out.

These various gold contracts have been a temporary patch in the monetary system, filling a niche in the economic environment of the world. You see why the dollar failed in 1933...too many claims issued on the available gold. You see why the "new dollar" failed in 1971...too many claims issued on the available gold. You see why the "new patchwork currency" of paper gold contracts will fail in due course...too many claims issued on the available gold. The caution is that more is in jeopardy than only the viability of this paper gold system. The dollar stands to fall with it as the excess paper side is firmly attached to dollars. In the 1920's, you might run to the bank with your "paper side of the deal", and the bank would be expected to make the contract "whole" by honoring the gold side or else it would FAIL trying--with no where else to turn. The parallel in today's system is that you might run to your contract writer (bullion bank) with your "paper side of the deal", and when the bank cannot itself produce the gold to settle the claim, it will have no choice but to turn to the spot gold market (if central banks will not stand for the clearing of gold reserves--such as the U.S. would not in 1971!) to buy gold with dollars, or else FAIL the dollar and themselves in the attempt.

Look for signs of lost confidence in the paper gold system to read the road ahead. Abnormally high lease rates on borrowed gold. The Bank of England, in the backyard of the LBMA, is selling much of its preciously small gold reserves into the hands of this same LBMA. The BoE has been the primary agent to push for IMF sales of gold. LBMA average daily turnover has been slowing, (to be taken as a sign of failing support of this paper system perhaps?) The ECB has called for a halt to gold lending activity among the euro system of member banks. This aggravates the fractional reserve system that depends on new loans to out pace loan repayments to the extent not provided by dishoarding and new production. And on those accounts, Y2K and low prices have brought record bullion sales, and these same low prices have brought failing mine production through shutdowns and curbed exploration. The warning signs are plentiful. When this paper system collapses, the gold metal that always remains will inherit the value currently spread thin throughout the expansive paper system.

got gold?

Gold: Saving Real Money In A Time Of Transition
Introduction

-----A gentleman leans over the fence and tells his neighbor that gold is going to rise in price from it's current $300. As the person on the other side of the fence thinks differently, they both agree to a binding bet. In three months, we will settle up with a payment of the change in the price of one hundred ounces of gold. Whatever it rises, the "bull" collects that amount. Likewise,whatever it falls, the "bear" collects from the bull. Each puts a $1500 payment guarantee into a common shoe box and gives it to another neighbor for safekeeping.

As an observer of the above, we have just witnessed the creation of a wager not unlike a comex futures contract. On each side of the fence stands a long and a short, that together create an open interest of one contract. Neither has any intention of buying gold, nor do they expect
physical gold to be a part of this bet. Yet, at cocktail parties and on public internet forums, one claims to have "brought gold" and the other states that he "sold gold".--

Canuck,
I have been in deep thought and discussion with a number of people today. Will do my best to get this posted in a simple form with the time left. I have to repeat, that post by Aragorn was presented in a way must certainly give a guideline to others. Every person receives information
and concepts differently. Myself and Another could never present this in a light that could be perceived by a large mass of people. With others writing from their own viewpoint, the message is more easily engaged. As events occur, the motives and the intent of this puzzle will become
public discussion on many mediums.

SteveH, I didn't read your #10888 before posting to Canuck. I don't know ORO but he does have the technical ability to present his view of this market in a higher format. He sounds like a player that has had ties to Bullion Bankers. Sometimes, a person in "position" sees things they
can't explain. Then a few clues come along that make it all fall in place. Anyway, it's also an excellent run down of the present situation that, like Aragorn, brings us right up into today's action.

So Canuck, Paper Gold? Here is a story that could be true.

Have you ever been to a high profile cocktail party with a bunch of mover / trader types. The talk always gets into investments then sooner or later international finance and money flows. Of the gold bulls: One guy says he is "betting" on gold and brought and paid for 1,000 K-rands.

Another says he is also "betting" on gold and brought 200 Comex futures. Then a third, the money man that gave the party, says he had his broker go long some major gold commitments in London.

The average observer would perceive from this discussion that these gentlemen all brought gold. However, his observations would be only 1/3 right. Let's look at these investments "in context".

The first person was the only one that brought gold. He said he was "betting" on gold, but in true context, he was the only one that was "investing" in the metal. His casual use of the term "bet" was for him only a figure of speech and did not carry the same meaning as the other two. It's also, most important to grasp that his investment was the only one that actually created a demand for the metal.

The next person was, in every sense of the word "betting" on the gold. He only put a small cash deposit with his broker and paid a commission to buy 200 contracts. Let's say I was the floor trader that took the other side of those contracts. I also had to place some cash as a deposit to
take the other side of that position. In the true context of this trade, gold is not involved. Neither one of us expects to buy or sell or in any way move any gold. I don't have any gold to sell him anyway, nor does he have enough money to pay for the 20,000 ounces those contracts represent
(for discussion let's say he is like 90% of the people that trade this arena and I know his financial position) So, if we are not buying and selling gold, what are we really doing? He and I are "betting" "ON THE PRICE OF GOLD". The only reason there is any gold in the warehouse, is to
make the contracts legal. Truly, there doesn't need to be any gold deposited for these trades to be successfully concluded. In the rare event that some players want real gold, the short would just go out and buy and deliver it. (Bear in mind that we are trying to understand the concept, not the finer points of the rules and regs. of this arena.) If the price goes up he takes some of my cash. If the price goes down, I take some of his cash. The whole game is about cash, not gold. Why is it so important to drag this point out? Because, the trading of Paper Gold has a very small impact on the demand for gold, compared to the amounts of paper traded! Yet, in today's world gold market, the price paid by investors (not gamblers) for the purchase of real gold is created in these very paper gold markets. Every dealer sells downstream using some derivative price based on
Comex or London.

Let's look at our major player, the money man. He's big, real big. For a number of years he had about 1.4 million ounces of bullion bars in a vault in a Euro depository. Then some bank approached him and asked to use his gold. They would write him a certificate of ownership that committed the bank to owing him the gold. He would receive a nice yearly fee for this and still have his gold. The only difference is that he now owned Paper Gold. For him, it was time to "get with the program" and "think in this new world era". Besides, the world class size and history of this bank made their "commitment of gold delivery" "as good as gold"! Hell, he had that much in cash with them already and that was loaned out to earn interest, so why not the gold for fat fees? The bank sold the gold for cash and held that cash on deposit as the offsetting position for a negotiated gold loan to a miner. Then they sold the gold loan commitment (but not the gold loan) to a major gold investor that would take delivery of the new mined gold as it came in. That
investor may have used future oil sales as his equity or outright sale of oil futures or just plain cash. The banks original cash was now freed up, because another player was offsetting the gold loan. The miner saw the money in a special account, building interest that would fund his production sales at higher than spot prices. Yet, any time that loan was paid down with gold delivery, it went
directly to another player.

With the original cash raised from the first sale, the bank can now sell it's own gold commitments on the open market to other would be gold owners. Using the funds to support various carry trades for other clients. All the while collecting fees for this good legal service. And
it goes on and on and on and on. Just banking, paper gold banking, that is! The variation to this are as numerous as the people involved. You see, as gold from the private sector poured in, it's sales were used to build a massive infrastructure. And, indeed as long as gold price went down to slightly sideways, it was very profitable.

Canuck, this is how the paper gold trade has been used to first deflate the demand for real gold and second, increase the supply of physical gold. All the while building a massive gold ownership following. The problem is that most of this new ownership is based on cash settlement, using the
price of gold. Usually, in the small print, it states that if gold can't be delivered, they will give you cash based on spot and you can buy it yourself.

Now Michael knows how the demand for physical has been covered with supply from the private sector. As the WGC numbers show, the CBs mostly used gold comments to lend to the middle men while the mechanics of the market used the private stores for supply. On a net basis, very little gold has left the world CB vaults. A fact, not my opinion!
In the event of failure, the "important" customers will be covered by the Euro CBs or made whole in Euros. Everyone else is watching as the private supplies are now gone. What a mess!

Yes, the gold shares will do well as long as investors see gold rising and don't discount the mines need to have an established market to sell into.... However, the miners have never been tested in an environment that has the "establishment" world gold market falling while the physical
market is locked up in a demand crisis. If they (the mines) owe gold to a bullion bank (to repay a gold loan) and the BB has failed, will they be allowed to dump the gold on the market? I doubt it.
Some of them have a clause that allows them to postpone the repay of gold loans in the event of a price spike (ABX???). But, in this crisis the "official" inter bank paper price may fall! Only the physical has risen on what will be described as a "simi black market". I bet they would still have to sell to whoever buys the loan from the defunct BB and sell at the paper price.
Will the media set back and watch the "unhedged" miners, sell $2,000 gold to the public when everyone knows that it should be sold at the official world price of $200? After all, the public still thinks the government price of $42.00 is correct and the present value of $250 is the result of gold bugs? A giant can of worms.



The way I see it: The mines stock will rise. But, is this rise enough to justify the risk the owners will take if this market blows up? Remember, the nature of this new market isn't like the 70s or the 80s gold bulls. No one has ever witnessed the short squeeze of a world class financial
instrument that can not be covered! No printing press resolution here. If the G-7 must intervene and negate all gold clauses, it will most certainly involve an attachment to every mine in an effort to share the pain. They used this market of gold loans to their advantage so part of the problem is also at their doorstep!

Still, the resulting void of paper gold to supply demand would drive all trade into physical purchases. Add this to the concept of the Euro as a new reserve currency and one can see how the dollar price of gold could run into the many thousands. Enough of a value for me to stay in physical only. In the footsteps, my friend!

I'm sorry Canuck, there is just no easy way for me to explain this. I am very tiredand look forward to everyone's discussions on gold at a later time.

Thank you FOA

Canuck (8/11/99; 5:35:12MDT - Msg ID:10885)---------Question, funds currently invested
through RRSP (401K?s in the US) do not allow ownership of much other than equities, or in some cases bonds."
Canuck, some people use CEF? Next best thing?

Julia (8/11/99; 9:25:06MDT - Msg ID:10897)----------Hi FOA, Didn't you say once to watch the COMEX to see this new gold market played out? COMEX delivery intention
breakdown? What are Issues and Stoppers?
Julia, I said watch Open Interest figures as they will most likely surge into all-time high territory (400,000+++) when an uncontrollable run starts. Comex is the only visible arena that paper shorts can cover in when they can't get the real metal to close trades. Because Comex mostly represents cash bets by longs, the shorts can use cash equity to establish long positions as a means to offset their paper sold position. It's won't close their exposure, only cover it. The OI hasn't spiked yet, but I think it will, big time. As for the local jargon, it just indicates who is locking up real metal deposits. Not much left there, as I think GS is positioning for Mr. WB!
Another said a long time ago (in one of his posts) that his (WB) silver purchases were only front running in a public company. As the cash amounts were real small for his size. His private money was moving quietly into gold. This Comex lock may indicate that there isn't any more (in size)
around?

Foreign Purchases of T bonds chart----http://www.investech.com/---Has anyone noticed this?
18K, that chart tells the story. Everyone keeps asking why any entity (or conspiracy) would want to destroy the dollar? Wrong context to view the action. The dollar is being dumped because of the inflationary expansion of this US money. The debt it has created is destroying whole economies. People are moving out of it because they are looking into the future and see a currency that "will" be devalued from it's own sins! If you sell your house and move on, are you killing the neighborhood that made you prosperous? No, you sell because the crime and decay is
going to lower your asset values!

Peter Asher (8/11/99; 13:21:27MDT - Msg ID:10926)----The Credit and Tulipmania Global bubble, cannot burst without destroying most paper held value. What else can they move paper money into and have value survive? On this premise is built the opinion that there will be visible Gold accumulation before there is visible equity distribution."
Peter, Yes! The gold part of this action has been going on for some years in the form of Paper Gold. Only now they will run from Paper gold first, before the physical gold bull!

TownCrier (8/11/99; 13:39:57MDT - Msg ID:10931)---Fed has no comment on Greenspan resignation rumor"
TC, it was a done deal when RR quit. Believe it!

Leigh (8/11/99; 14:42:29MDT - Msg ID:10937)---silver will be re-monetized?
Leigh, the hyped talk about silver has been around sense "forever". It's a good medium to gamble in but the real old world money always has and always will be in gold. I would go against my thoughts and bet on Goldfield (GOLD) or Homestake (HM) long before going for silver.

Orca (8/11/99; 15:20:53MDT - Msg ID:10941)---------It makes no sense that physical gold will increase, but companies that own non mined or just mined physical gold will not share in gold's value. They can hold it or sell it directly to those that want it thus reaping the benefit. Short of total confiscation by governments around the world, this will hold true... and if not, why not?
Orca, confiscation was never my term (that I remember anyway?). Does the government confiscate your assets when they tax your earnings? Do they confiscate oil profits by controlling the local price of oil as the Texas Railroad Commission did? Did they Confiscate oil reserves with
the windfall profits tax ( that was retroactive backwards, I might add). In the future, if they said "to promote fair trade and protect the consumer from the fraud of a manipulated private gold market, that has artificially priced gold in the thousands, we, the G-7 propose that all mine sales of gold must be made at the London (or wherever) world market price". Did someone just confiscate a mine here? No way my friend, dig away! (just thinking and smiling, without offense)
koan, I know you are reading this also (as I read all of yours too).

SteveH (8/11/99; 16:04:14MDT - Msg ID:10943)---I take exception to the extremis position that A/FOA hold to the dollar being on its last leg. Who would want this?
Steve, no one wants it, it is just a function of being "free to choose". No one wanted the British pound to fall from it's centuries old standing as a world reserve currency, but it did. And a lot of people lost a bunch of money in the process.
Also: Your post: One clarification please: "CBs mostly used gold comments to lend to the middle men while the mechanics of the market used the private stores for supply...." If you had to substitute a word for 'comments,' what would it be?
Sorry, bad word. I intended to use commitments, yet guarantees would have been an even better choice.

thanks all, FOA

Aristotle: Life on Earth: Gold and the Free Market

-----------The great irony is that a Venezuelan lawyer (and oil minister) named Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso studied and used the Texas Railroad Commission as his model for OPEC, which he co-founded with the Saudi Arabian director of the Office of Petroleum Affairs, Abdullah Tariki, in 1960. OPEC from the beginning maintained that oil was a depleting asset, and it had to be replaced by other assets to balance national budgets and fund developments.----------

When Aristotle wrote his great piece (partly reproduced above) I wondered if others would like to further read the history of the TRC (actually it's called the Railroad Commission of Texas). A fascinating read that gives a clear picture of the how and why it came into being. The TRC
produced "An Informal History Compiled for Its Centennial" in April 1991. They don't talk much about gold, but in a way, because the TRC has been studied and copied worldwide, it's precedent has everything to do with the future of the gold industry in our time. In as much as many of you are
invested in this area, it could be important to understand. Texas "controlled" oil and gas by declaring it's production to be a "public utility".

-----------June 12, 1920 Legislature declares the production and sale of natural gas to be a public utility and gives the Railroad Commission jurisdiction. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6053 (Vernon 1962)(original version at 11920 Tex. Gen. Laws. ch. 14).--------

They never confiscated anything, but in the end controlled it completely. Koan says "we are a nation of laws". Yes, and those laws are created and administered by governments in the interest of people. Not always "all the people" but " the people" never the less. Even the US supreme court
declared that Rule 37 was the proper exercise of government power in controlling "natural resources"! Notice they didn't say "just oil and gas".

-------April 16, 1928 First Rule 37 Case. United States Supreme Court holds that the Act of March 31,1919, conferring authority on the Railroad Commission to administer the oil and gas laws is a proper exercise of the police power of the state in controlling the development of natural resources.

Even though the Texas Surface Mining Act does not presently contain laws that apply to gold mining, it is but a short jump for the US to declare the production of gold a "public utility" and implement Rule 37 controls on a national level.

-------June 21, 1975 Legislature enacts the Texas Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and requires the Railroad Commission to adopt rules and regulations governing the mining of coal, lignite and uranium and the reclamation or restoration of lands disturbed by mining operations. Act

Just so we can read the sign post along the trail, let's see where the TRC came from. The following is indeed a general history that leaves out much of the behind the doors wars that controlled prices. I'll reprint some of their work in an effort to lay a foundation. I believe the Gold industry will quickly come to be governed in the same manner (only much quicker). Perhaps we discuss later.

-An Informal History Compiled for Its Centennial(April 1991)

THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS

CREATION OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS

The floor of the Texas House in 1889 and early 1890 was not a peaceful place. The battle had been joined between the railroad supporters and the supporters of Governor James S.
Hogg. While he was Attorney General, Hogg had taken on the railroads, prosecuting several of them as well as the rate-setting organization of railroads, the Texas Traffic
Association, for monopolistic actions and conspiracy to discourage competition. In the race for governor which he won in 1890, Hogg had campaigned for the creation of a
commission to regulate the railroads.

In just a few decades, the railroads had turned from being the object of enticements by the state and many communities to being an object of derision. Why this change?

Notwithstanding Mr. Brown's remarks, Texas had early on encouraged the railroads. In 1850, Bexar county became the first of many counties issuing bonds to railway companies
to encourage settlement and communication. In 1852, the State began to grant railroad companies land: 8 sections of 640 acres each for every mile of completed road. Within two
years, that was upped to 16 sections per mile completed.

In the Eastern United States, the railroads followed the people, connecting already existing population centers. In most of Texas, it was the other way around. From the time
of the Republic, it was a recognized policy to set about attracting settlers from back east and the countries of Europe. One way to do that was to have a transportation system already in place. But, railroads are heavily capital intensive--it took a lot of money to do the necessary grading, buy and install the ties and rails, purchase the steam locomotives and cars. Since the companies did not want to invest if there was no market--no people and no goods--the state sweetened the pot by land grants, bond issuances, and loans.

Some railroads were given right-of-ways and alternate sections of public land along them, with the off sections usually going for schools. The railroads advertised heavily back east and abroad to bring in settlers to whom they could sell land from their grant sections. To encourage purchases, the railroads sought to endow selected communities with an aura of stability by aiding in the building of sturdy courthouses, jails, and even churches.

Coming out of the boom in construction that followed the Civil War, the Texas and Pacific Railway finished construction of its railway line from Texarkana to Sherman and from Longview to Eagle Ford--a total of 251 miles--in 1873. The next portion of the Texas and Pacific began in 1881 as the line moved from Fort Worth toward El Paso, using a land grant from the State for 5,338,528 acres.

By the next year, the law authorizing land grants was repealed--there was no more available public land.

In the decades after the Civil War, the people of Texas began to recognize the power railroad companies held. Dirt roads for wagons were rough and most were short. The state had no navigable waterways. Railroads were the only way to ship materials in and products out. The major railroads had formed an organization, the Texas Traffic Association, which set rates at whatever level it was felt the traffic would bear. One result was an arbitrary cast to some rates: one railroad shipped lumber from East Texas to Nebraska for a lower rate than when it was shipped from East Texas to Dallas. M. M. Crane, a prominent Texas political leader of the time described the situation. "The owners of the railroads were like many other people," he said. "Having the power to charge what they pleased, they were never overly modest in fixing their compensation."

Such abuses and discriminatory rates primed the people of Texas for change. Let's take a more detailed look at those early Texas railroad years and trace the path leading to
effective regulation.

---------EARLY TEXAS RAILROADS------

[from an early(ca. 1940), unpublished Commission manuscript]

The Republic of Texas granted the first government charter on December 16, 1836 to the Texas Rail-Road, Navigation and Banking Company. The company soon dissolved without any stock being sold or a single mile of track laid.

In 1838, the Brazos and Galveston Railroad Company was granted the next charter which included the provision "Congress...shall have the sole power of regulating rates of tolls." Later charters required "good and sufficient causeways" at road crossings, signals with locomotive bell and steam whistle, brake upon hindmost car, "good T- or U-shaped iron rails" of defined minimum weight, and the provision of connection between intersecting railroads.

The great difficulties attending the construction of the first railroads caused many of the early charters to be forfeited for failure to fulfill the conditions of the charters. The first company to begin actual railroad construction was the Harrisburg Railroad and Trading Company which was chartered January 4, 1841. Construction had progressed to the extent of some grading of the right-of-way and the contracting for some cross-ties when the project was abandoned because of lack of funds and the "threat of invasion of Texas by Mexico." On February 11, 1850, a charter was issued to the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway, the successor of the Harrisburg Railroad & Trading Company. Grading was begun the following year, track laying the next, and by August 1, 1853, the first twenty miles of railroad in Texas was in operation between Harrisburg and Stafford.

Despite the relatively early date at which the operation of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway was begun, the Texas Legislature had already enacted rather comprehensive laws pertaining to railroads. On February 7, 1853, the Legislature approved, "An Act to Regulate Railroad Companies." Its provisions included
requirements for annual reports, legislative regulation of rates (allowing a 12 percent profit), directors being liable for debts, fixed regulations covering uniforms, crossings,
facilities, bells, etc., and allowing the state to purchase railroads.

The recognition of the people of Texas that railroads were urgently needed to carry forward the development of the State is reflected in the subsidies which were granted the
railroad companies, subsidies of both land and the use of money from public funds at a low rate of interest.

Although much of the early legislation regulating railroads was adapted to control inherent abuses in a monopolistic form of business enterprise, the administration of the laws left a great deal to be desired. Since there was no agency especially created to administer the provisions of the Act to Regulate Railroad Companies, the railroads
generally did not comply with the regulations. As the abuses of the carriers became progressively worse, especially after the Civil War, various groups were organized for the
express purpose of fostering regulatory measures to which the railroads would be directly amenable. One of these groups was a farmers organization called, the Patrons of
Husbandry, commonly known as the "Grange", organized in 1873, and having a membership of 40,000. The Grange directed its attack against the "fearful rates of freight," "profligate and greedy management," and "efforts to control legislation, influence courts or override law and justice." The agitation of the Grange resulted in a resolution calling on the Constitutional Convention of 1875 to prescribe a remedy to eliminate the abuses of the railroads.

The character of some of the constitutional provisions points significantly to the nature of some of the abuses practiced by the carriers. And it also indicates the increased ability of the peoples' representatives to cope with the problems of railroad regulation.

However, as sometimes happens in the passage of new laws, there was a very considerable lag in time between the enactment of the regulatory provisions and the effectual implementing of them by the government or one of its agencies. As yet no agency or commission had been created and especially charged with the responsibility of
administering the new regulations. Although the setting up of a railroad commission to administer the railroad laws had been recommended as early as 1876, the recommendation was strongly opposed by some interests, especially the financial backers of the railroads, who considered such legislation hostile and branded the proposals as "injudicious interference with business by legislatures."

After much agitation the office of State (railroad) Engineer was created in 1883, but the office had no power to order or compel obedience of the laws. Its function was to
investigate and make reports to the Attorney General. The office was destined for failure, and after two years it was abolished. Bills calling for a railroad commission were passed by the House in 1887 and 1889; however, the Senate refused to pass the bills on the grounds of constitutionality. This objection was circumvented by the adoption of a constitutional amendment authorizing the creation of a railroad commission. With the last obstacle out of the way, the Legislature passed an act creating the Railroad Commission of Texas in 1891. The fight for its creation had taken sixteen years. Some say it was the
predominant political issue of the time.

[The Caption from the Act Passed by the Texas Legislature in 1891]

An Act to establish a Railroad Commission for the State of Texas whereby discrimination and extortion in railroad charges may be prevented, and reasonable freight and passenger tariffs may be established; to prescribe and authorize the making of rules and regulations to govern the Commission and the railroads, and afford railroad companies and other parties adequate remedies; to prescribe penalties for the violation of this act and provide means and rules for its enforcement.

---ON JAMES S. HOGG, CAMPAIGNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 1890----

Hogg campaigned with awareness that there were more common people in Texas than any other kind, and he suited his merchandize [sic] to the market. He was a great commoner.
He knew the dirt farmer's soul, and which allusions grabbed his mind. Hogg was earthy in his speech, inventive in his epithets--though "by gatlings" was the worst he essayed when
ladies were around. Hogg was a flaming reformer on the hustings, standing against everything the embattled farmer hated, inventing some things the farmer had not yet
imagined. But Hogg was no fool, nor was he really radical. He was a flamboyant, but deeply folk-conservative man; he knew how to survive in party politics, whom to fight, and
with whom to make a deal. He was a hoeman champion, but no farmer himself; he ended up quite rich. Hogg had a keen mind, and he proved it more than once in court against
some able outside legal talent. Above all else, however, in the public eye he was a stump man.

On the stump, he could hold a crowd of Texas farmers for hours, blasting railroads, bloated capitalists, insurance companies, gold; he extolled the simple life and the virtue of the men who tilled the soil. He threw off his coat and worked up sweats; he dropped his suspenders and splashed water over his brow, got his second wind, and went on to new
heights amid cheers. Hogg and his railroad commission plan won by a huge vote.

----------THE "RAILROADS" IN THE RAILROAD COMMISSION-----

Within a very short period of time after its creation, the Railroad Commission cut the rates railroads were allowed to charge. Almost immediately, the Commission was taken to
court and placed under injunction. It was not until 1894 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that the act creating the Railroad Commission was constitutional that the
lower rates were put into effect.

In the meantime, in 1892, the railroads made an unsuccessful run at having the legislature abolish the Commission. In 1893, the Commission was granted statutory authority to regulate issuance of railroad stocks and bonds. In 1894 the constitution was amended to change the office of the three Commissioners from appointive to elective, with six year staggered terms.

The Commission's responsibilities included:

1. Administration of laws relating to the railroads of Texas.
2. Determination of passenger fares, freight rates, and charges for all classes of commoncarriers in Texas.
3. Holding public hearings.

4. Receiving of reports, making investigations, and keeping of records regarding fiscalstructure, valuation, revenues and expenses, and train, terminal, and traffic service of
Texas railroads.

The legal focus of the Commission was on intrastate passenger and freight activities within the borders of Texas. Interstate moves fell under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Interstate Commerce Commission.

NOTE: John H. Reagan, first Chairman of the Railroad Commission, had been instrumental in the creation of the federal commission in 1887 while he was serving as
U.S. Senator from Texas.

When the Commission was founded in 1891, there were some 8,700 miles of track. When the railroads reached their peak in Texas in 1930, there were 17,500 miles. Following
World War II, increasingly goods began to travel by truck and people by buses and cars and the miles of track began to shrink.

Over recent decades, the role of the Railroad Commission in the regulation of railroads has changed, moving from economic regulation to safety regulation. The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 vested rail safety responsibilities in the Federal Railroad
Administration. In 1983, the Railroad Commission began a cooperative process with the federal government, implementing a rail safety program. The Rail Safety and Planning section of the Transportation/Gas Utilities Division monitors the state's rail lines, inspecting railroad equipment, operations, and track. This section also maintains the state's rail planning program and oversees the use of federal funds for track rehabilitation projects.

Under provisions of the 1980 Federal Staggers Rail Act, the Railroad Commission recognized that it could hold only a passive role in rate setting. In 1984, the Railroad
Commission ceased its historic role in economic regulation of the Texas rail industry.

---------------OIL AND GAS---------

Shortly after the end of the Civil War, the first purposeful and successful attempt at drilling for oil in Texas occurred at Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches in East Texas. In 1866, less than a decade after Colonel Edwin Drake's 1859 Titusville, Pennsylvania well brought America into the age of oil, Lyne T. Barret struck oil at 106 feet. Oil had been found before in Texas, but it was either through surface leaks or when drilling for water. Alas for Barret, though, the greater volumes and lower producing costs of Pennsylvania oil beat his Texas oil. As a result, he abandoned the well.

Then, in 1894, the beginnings of the Texas age of oil were realized by the first major discovery--Corsicana in the east-central part of the state. Then it seemed like it was one discovery right after another. The first true boom came from the 1901 Spindletop gusher of Anthony Lucas. Working with a salt mining company in Louisiana, he had noticed the
gentle mounds that raised the surface of the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast. He recognized these as salt domes--natural traps holding reservoirs of oil. Spindletop was not the last of the south-east Texas fields. More followed.

The next cluster of discoveries was in North Central Texas between 1902 and 1920--Petrolia, Electra, and Burkburnett--and, during that same period, and a little further south--Breckenridge and Desdemona in 1918.

Throughout these early years, whenever a boomer came in, oil seemed to cover the surrounding lands. The pressure of some of these wells was so great that it was days before the flow could be controlled. In the meantime, oil soaked into the ground, or ran off in nearby creeks and gullies, or was directed into nearby pits that were hastily dug. Even
after the flow was controlled, pits were used for storage or vast open tanks. The results were inevitable--waste and pollution. While pollution may not have been a concern in
those early days (oil was a sign of wealth and adventure even if it was in a creek), waste was. And, a fire roaring from one well to the next, engulfing one tank then another, was an all too frequent occurrence.

While the Texas Legislature in the later 1800s and early 1900s had passed several bills relating to the use or conservation of the state's oil and gas, a familiar thing
happened--very little or nothing in the way of observance. Laws without enforcement or with enforcement only through the courts had a tendency to be ignored. As each discovery
occurred, more waste occurred.

Other problems cropped up in the infant industry. Transportation was one. To have substantive value, the oil had to reach its markets--the refineries. Early on, miles of tank cars were pulled by steam locomotives. Then, pipelines became the choice in many regions. However, if a company owned both a pipeline and wells, the tendency was to take
from its wells and ignore surrounding wells owned by another company. In 1917, to prevent abuses, the Legislature designated oil pipelines as common carriers and, more
importantly, give jurisdiction to the Railroad Commission which was already regulating a transportation industry--the railroads. By 1919, the Commission was also granted
jurisdiction over oil and gas production. It was at that date the Oil and Gas Division was created.

Regulation did not truly take hold until the 1930s and it was a struggle all the way. The East Texas Oil Field was discovered in 1930. Unlike many other fields at this stage of industry development, the East Texas Field was taken over by a multitude of small independent operators, each racing to put up a rig. Derrick touched legs with derrick. Each well was produced wide-open. The price of oil crashed. More critically, it was felt that the natural water drive of the field was being lost. When the Railroad Commission tried to step in and cut back production, action began in the courts and, at one point, State military forces were called in to regain order. It was several years before courts and the
State Legislature were able to settle on the position that the Commission had the right to prorate production--to conserve the state's natural resources, to protect correlative rights, and prevent pollution.

Since the 1930s, the Railroad Commission has held a leading role in the regulation of oil and gas, one that has been recognized throughout the world. Even though production has been declining over the last few decades, the state still produces more oil and gas than any other state. Indeed, if Texas were a nation, it would rank as one of the top ten producers. Today, there are some 241,000 active oil and gas wells which produce an average of some 1.7 million barrels of oil a day and 11.5 BCF (billion cubic feet) of gas a day. The Commission's Oil and Gas Division tracks that production and ensures that it follows allocations that are calculated each month. In addition, through its ten district
offices, field inspectors visit the wells and facilities across the state to ensure compliance with Commission rules and regulations. Increasingly important, the division works to ensure that the water resources of the state are protected from damage by oil and gas field activities.

Here is one of the problems with this gold conspiracy idea. If gold were artificially low, or if there was true physical shortages, or both, as most maintain, Asia would be in there buying with both hands. I do not believe Asia has ever been considered as part of this gold conspiracy - so how do the conspiracy buffs explain Asia?

---------About a year or two ago, that is all everyone talked about. The facts, to "eagerly address the obvious hard question, is that Asia was buying with both hands. All of the WGC figures point that out. Go back and review their (and any other gold news letters) articles for the 96, 97 era. It's all there. Every gold bug looked to Asia and India to ignite the next bull market. It didn't happen! This massive physical buying was on the verge of destroying the liquid supplies that backed much of the modern paper gold market. Without a liquid market, gold in dollars would have exploded, wrecking the dollar's credibility before the Euro was born. The BIS stepped in and stopped supporting the Asian currencies. An effect that broke the ability of these countries to buy gold. Koan, this was all pointed out some time ago. You must have not seen it. It's only today, that we see the recovery of demand from this part of the world. With the Euro in place, that demand will not be hindered again.---

And, indeed, if the paper contracts do become voided from nonperformance, should we wait for the outcome in the courts before attempting to purchase more gold? Is it possible that the price and availability of physical gold could become a bit of a problem as as the mainstream media confirms these events? Indeed, it is interesting conjecture.----------- (just thinking)

What are your thoughts on the Goldman Sachs event as it relates to our favorite subject?

CM,
Our present gold market has evolved into a paper trading arena. It didn't just happen overnight (meaning the last several years).
During most of the 90s the actual demand for gold was easily covered by selling paper gold to those that wanted "a gold portfolio". Contrary to current thought, most of the major buyers of gold (investors that put 500,000+ into it), don't buy coins, bars or fully paid for warehouse receipts. In this "new gold market" they put 20% into some form of paper gold derivative that theoretically can deliver a half million in gold and the other 90% into interest bearing instruments. They then proceed to tell everyone that they have gold in their portfolio.
This is why the current and recent past demand for gold has not impacted the actual physical price. The majority of the paper gold market is a cash market that circumvents the buying of real gold. The demand is satisfied because short players can sell a paper gold derivative without having
or needing any gold, just a large cash deposit will do. In addition, it also works because gold investors are willing to hold and roll over this paper as long as they perceive that the short could buy gold if delivery was ever asked for.
As long as some gold can be delivered and it's price is down trending, over time, a mindset is developed among investors that this paper gold market is "the physical gold market". It's not! A true physical market, buying coins, bars or holding fully paid for warehouse receipts would totally overwhelm the physical supply today. Converting just the current new demand for paper gold (not
considering anyone trying to move out of old paper gold) into physical, would blow the market sky high. It hasn't to date because the demand is hidden as it is channeled into paper supply.
I tried to comment on MKs question about where all the new gold is coming from. Currently, new mine supply is covering industrial and coin needs. Any additional physical gold needs are covered by private investors slowly scrumming to the "new age" trends and holding gold derivatives
instead of their real gold stock. This process has been ongoing for some time.
Every industry observer keeps tabs on the "so called "big supply deficit". I can tell you that deficit is almost nothing compared to the demand being covered by paper gold. Forget the shorts running for cover, that's the small potatoes angle followed by the trading crowd. The real move
comes when the current world gold market, operating as the "real physical gold market" breaks from default! Once it's discredited all that demand will then funnel into physical gold and lock up the dealer network for some time (perhaps years) untill price can balance demand.
Yes, we are a nation and world of laws, and because of that the courts will be loaded with gold owners that ended up with just "the obligation of another to supply gold". We saw in my bit about the TRC and how they evolved into something different from what was started. The same can be
said about the gold market. Evolution: The breaking of the dollar obligation to supply gold: the need to create an equal exchange medium for oil supplies: then the use of no interest gold to generate liquidity as cover for destroyed dollar reserves. These real life politically inspired manipulations have brought us to today's approaching destruction of our world gold market. Not the rambling
commodity supply and demand conjectures of traders.
What of the GS comex gold grab? First here is a part of an earlier post: FOA (5/26/99; 20:00:20MDT-Msg ID:6766) ------My friends, the choice is now "clean" and "clear"! The writers of paper gold "outside" the Euro realm are cornered with the lack of available gold! Completely!
--- Presently, from inertia, they still control the "paper price" in the dollar / IMF arena, but they can never convert it into gold. They must do what any cornered being will, continue to create (short) contracts of worthless nature to protect their position. At some point, their market will suffer a total collapse and cease to function. It will happen no other way.-------------

CM, Several months ago and some $20 higher I said that gold would go no lower and physical would become hard to obtain in quantity. I was wrong on the price because I did not fully understand Another's post. Later he pointed out that the actual process of this market failing would
bring on the discounting of paper gold against physical. I didn't believe it at first, but he has to know, he's in the middle of it.
Now I know he was right as there are no large blocks of gold to be purchased. Anyone wanting a few hundred thousand ounces must wait for unknown delivery. As everyone begins to hold onto whatever gold they have (and buy more), the outstanding paper will be forced to revert to cash
settlement. Much as the dollar prior to 71. No gold delivered, you just settled for cash, the dollar cash in your hand. Only, this time, the settlement cash will make a run for gold. It's started.
Truly, we watch this new gold market together, yes? FOA

CM,
Ha, Ha, you are good! I was wrong all the way around on this one. In my mind I meant to say "scrumming into" as a kind of rugby disorder that occurs in that play.

---Any additional physical gold needs are covered by private investors slowly scrumming INTO the "new age" trends and holding gold derivatives instead of their real gold stock.--

For anyone else here: Scrummage: a rugby play in which the forwards of each side come together in a tight formation and struggle to gain position of the ball as it is tossed in among them.

Your writing along with Aragorn's helps enormously in expanding the view of this subject. It is little wonder that the general public is confused from the hellacious interpretations from the media. Even the news reporters understand but tiny bits of this and that is applied out of context of the big picture.
Below is a good write-up about the Euro. It offers the very reason why it will outlive the dollar.

------''Since the internationalization of the euro, as such, is not a policy objective, it will be neither fostered nor hindered by the Euro system, the bank's analysis said.-

The ECB is clearly not playing the "trading" game. World movers want the Euro to move quickly up and down, so as to profit in their derivatives positions. That is the real reason for criticism. To their credit, the ECB did not sell the Euro when it opened too high and they didn't buy it when it went too low. That practice alone will win massive support for this currency when the dollar is broken with a high gold price. In that time, using the Euro for trade and accounts will look no different to Americans than it would to Canadians using dollars. In truth, the Euro will look much better! see below

ECB Focuses On Potential, Not Frailty, Of the Euro


By John Schmid International Herald Tribune

FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank moved Tuesday to shift
attention away from the euro's prolonged weakness and toward its potential for gaining an expanding role in the global economy.
While few would disagree that the euro stands a chance to cut into the dollar's hegemony, the central bank's position points to the growing acceptance of the 11-nation currency by non-European governments and companies and the eventual prospect of greater European Union influence in international affairs.

''The ECB can be pleased about this because it shows an underlying confidence,'' said Adolf Rosenstock of Nomura International in Frankfurt. 'The trend is well documented, and it is a good time to review the issue.''

The central bank's view, laid out in its bulletin for August, presents a brighter view of the euro than foreign-exchange traders have conveyed so far this year.

The euro lost 15 percent of its value against the dollar in its first six months after its debut in January, nearly reaching parity with the U.S. currency. After bouncing as high as $1.08 less than two weeks ago, the common
currency has begun to soften again.

In midday trading Tuesday in New York, it fell to $1.0525 from $1.0578 on Monday. It also slid to a new low against the yen.

The central bank was careful to avoid any suggestion that it was striving for global influence. Rather, the bank emphasized that however the euro's role evolved, it would be determined by market-driven forces.

'Since the internationalization of the euro, as such, is not a policy objective, it will be neither fostered nor hindered by the Eurosystem,'' the bank's analysis said.

Despite its disclaimer, economists say the euro's role abroad is just as important to the central bank as the exchange rate. Indeed, the euro's global role will become one of its permanent features, while its value in currency
markets fluctuates daily.

The central bank avoided suggesting how rapidly the euro's role would expand. Nor did it say to what degree the euro could dent the dollar's dominance. It also made clear that the euro's gains as a reserve currency for use by central banks would come more slowly than its gains in the private
sector.

A handful of ''risk characteristics'' will determine how forcefully the euro establishes itself, the bank said. Those include investor confidence in monetary union and the pace of economic reforms and fiscal discipline among the 11 euro nations. Sustained growth in Europe and the competitiveness of its companies can also ''foster the international use of its currency,'' it said.

The euro made its most immediate and concrete debut with an unexpected flourish of new euro-denominated bond issues. In the first half of 1999, the euro accounted for a greater share of international debt underwriting than the combined shares of the former euro-bloc currencies.

The euro even overtook the dollar in that period, the central bank pointed out. About Û100 billion ($105.78 billion) in euro-denominated bonds, notes and money-market instruments flooded the market in the first half,
compared with the equivalent of Û87.1 billion of dollar-denominated securities.

'This is one part of monetary union that is going better than planned,'' Mr.Rosenstock said.

The report also pointed out that the euro began from a position of global strength. The euro already ranks as the ''second most widely used currency at the international level,'' behind the dollar and ahead of the yen, it said.

Compared with the United States, the euro area has a slightly smaller economic output but accounts for a greater share of world exports, it said.

The euro also will remain the second most important reserve currency for the world's central banks, it predicted. The euro's reserve-currency role also has the potential to expand, albeit slowly, the central bank said. Central
banks typically refrain from abrupt changes to their reserve balances, the European Central Bank said.

Move Over Fisk & Gould, James Turk, james@goldmoney.com, August 16, 1999

Copyright c 1999 The Freemarket Gold & Money Report. All rights reserved.

In 1869, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould tried to corner the Gold market, and for a time, this notorious duo succeeded. It is a fascinating story, that is relevant to what is happening in the Gold market today.....

... to protect this hoard, Gould paid $2 million to two shameless attorneys to lock up in litigation the assets of the NYGE and countless brokers, as well as to defend the pair from the 300-plus law suits subsequently filed against them. Some of this money also went to Boss
Tweed, who through the Tammany Society controlled New York City's finances and politicians.....

... why have I related this story ? ... within two weeks of August 16, 1999 another Gold squeeze will start .....

... Consequently, central bank manipulation of the Gold market has limits.

... abnormal conditions now prevailing in the Gold market provide the opportunity for the spike...the spark is being provided by Goldman Sachs.

This past Thursday, Goldman Sachs responded publicly to its actions taken over the past few days behind the scenes on the Comex. Goldman announced that it had given notice to the Comex that it was standing ready to take delivery of about 473,500 ounces of Gold, about one-half of the total weight in Comex vaults.....it could take delivery of even
more metal, possibly nearly depleting Comex stocks.

... the reasons behind this move by Goldman ?..... put two-and-two together.

... rumors ... that the big Tiger hedge fund is in trouble.
... investors in hedge funds...are withdrawing their investment quickly at the first hint of poor performance. Thus,Tiger has been suffering withdrawals of capital, which has required Tiger to liquidate investments to provide the funds needed to meet these withdrawals.

Now here is where it gets interesting.

Australia's largest Gold mining company is Normandy Mining (NDY). According to NDY's fourth quarter report dated June 30th, Tiger owned 11.68% of NDY. At present prices, the face value of that position is about US$156 million, surely not one of multi-billion Tiger's biggest positions, but nevertheless, it still is a big chunk of change.

Tiger acquired this stake from another Australian company a couple of years ago around A$1.75. NDY is now trading at A$1.20, and before the latest run-up in the Gold stocks was around A$1. But don't shed any tears for Tiger.

As I understand it, Tiger did what most hedge funds do; they hedged this position. How? Tiger had sold short Gold bullion, and its gains from this short position as the price of Gold slid lower have more than offset the losses on the drop in the NDY stock price. But these are paper profits, and now the hard part for Tiger begins. How do you unwind
this huge position without eroding your paper profits? Taking profits becomes exceptionally important when you need the cash to meet investor withdrawals, as Tiger apparently now does.

The first thing to do is buy the Gold needed to cover the short Gold position, and here, Goldman once again enters the picture. The metal now being accumulated by Goldman on Comex will I understand be delivered to Tiger, to enable Tiger to cover its short Gold position. What I hear is that Tiger will then unwind its long NDY/short Gold trade. In other words, Tiger has already purchased this metal on a forward basis.
Goldman is Tiger's broker on this trade, and Goldman will deliver to Tiger the metal Goldman will obtain from the delivery it is taking on Comex. Here's where it gets really interesting.

During the delivery of any month, it is the shorts that choose the time to deliver on their short position. The longs have no option but to wait for the shorts to decide when to deliver, and normally the shorts wait until the end of the month This slowness to deliver is understandable because it enables the shorts to earn interest as long as possible. This month the shorts must deliver by August 27th, which in Comex terms is the end of the month. Somehow and from somewhere, the shorts must come up with 473,500 ounces of Gold bullion, and possibly more if Goldman takes delivery this month on even more Gold.

No problem, you say, because there is 948,973 ounces of Gold in Comex vaults? Well, that is true. But who owns that Gold? What if none or few of those ounces are owned by those who are short the Gold that must be delivered to Goldman Sachs? In that case, where will the shorts get the Gold they need to deliver to Goldman?

Therefore, on or before August 27th, which is the last delivery day, one of three things will happen, AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SHORTS OWN THE 948,973 OUNCES OF METAL IN COMEX STOCKS.

1) If the shorts own this metal, they deliver metal to Goldman, and the Comex stocks will drop by 500,000-700,000 ounces (which is the weight that I expect Goldman to wait for delivery). The upward pressure on the Gold price in this case may be muted, and the squeeze in all likelihood averted for the time being. If so, all the shorts who have driven down the Gold price to its abnormally low level can continue for now to wring out every penny from their short position.

2) OR, IF THE SHORTS ARE NOT THE OWNERS OF THE METAL IN THE COMEX WAREHOUSE, we will get a huge short squeeze as the shorts try to find metal to meet their commitment. And I do mean HUGE, because there is no metal in the pipeline not already committed. The high Gold interest rate is a stark warning to the shorts that metal is not available.

3) Or finally, the market goes berserk because of the short squeeze and the Comex announces a repeat of what they did to Bunker Hunt, i.e., horrendous cash margins and only trading for delivery into Comex stocks is allowed. This alternative will probably prevent the short squeeze from reaching its full potential, but the Comex cannot be expected to act until the short squeeze has already begun. So there is still plenty of opportunity to make a lot of money on the spike that I expect in the Gold price.

The potential now exists to make the 1869 short squeeze engineered by Fisk and Gould look like child's play compared to what is coming up, if we get alternative #2 above. And my own guess is that we will get #2, but this is just my guess.

One other bit of info. Apparently, Goldman did not want to take delivery of this Comex stock (which they obviously knew would bring a lot of public attention to this move), but Goldman had to tap Comex. The reason? Goldman could not get their hands on this metal from any other source! There's nothing in the pipeline of this size not already committed, so this shortage of metal will add fuel to the fire of any short squeeze. This shortage of metal also explains why Gold interest rates are so high because as I have been saying in recent letters, there is no lender of last resort to the bullion banks.

Without any doubt, it should be an interesting couple of weeks! In nearly 30 years of commodity trading, I've never seen anything like this before, but the upside could be spectacular, even bigger and better than it was for Fisk and Gould.

THE BIG SQUEEZE If I've learned anything over the years, it is to not underestimate the power of central banks and their willingness to play 'hard ball' to enable them to keep their hands on that power. Witness the Gold sale by the Bank of England as evidence of my proposition. So if a big squeeze in the Gold market does occur, will the Federal Reserve stand idly by? Probably not, because I doubt very much whether the Fed would like to see the Gold price scoot to $500 per ounce in a fortnight.

We must therefore try to think through the other options as to what could happen if the Federal Reserve sticks its nose into the Gold market, if it hasn't already done so (some argue that the Fed already has its hand in manipulating the current low Gold price). In any case, some of its options are:

1) The Fed gets its central bank pals to lend metal, throwing to the wind any concerns they may have about the solvency of their counterparty and/or about their need for metal as Y2K approaches. This action would keep the Gold price and Gold's interest rate tame, much like what has happened since 1996.

2) The Fed gets more central bank pals (like Bank of England) to dishoard Gold. This option would accomplish much the same as #1 above.

3) The Fed brings in the federal government to intensify its anti-Gold media campaign. The nameless 'specs' are about to get bombarded with bad press if Gold begins to rise. The Fed will arrange with the media to get many quotes from friendly sources talking up what the Fed wants you to hear. Left unsaid of course will be the huge short position in Gold established over the past few years with central bank connivance, which has created today's abnormal conditions in the Gold market and made a squeeze possible.

4) The Fed gets the federal government to force the IMF to sell some of its Gold and/or to return Gold to its members, which will then be loaned and/or dishoarded by them, thereby providing enough metal to postpone the squeeze. These actions would also allow the abnormal conditions in the Gold market to prevail somewhat longer.

5) If all else fails, then the Fed asks the federal government to close down the Gold market and/or to confiscate Gold like Roosevelt did in 1933, thereby providing the opportunity for them to get their hands on enough metal to relieve the squeeze. This time though, the Fed would probably get most countries to participate in the closure/confiscation as well.

But if #5 happens, then I think the implications will be even far greater than just trying to prevent a Gold squeeze. We will in that case be witnessing the end of fractional reserve banking, a system fostered by central banks since the creation of the Bank of England in 1694. In other words, it will mean the end of the cartel given by governments to commercial banks to bilk a country's citizens in exchange for the power that commercial banks, through their ability to create fiat money, give to governments. What power is that?

Governments survive on fear and power, but they cannot create bullets out of thin air. So what do they do?

Through their captive central bank and partners in crime, the commercial banks, governments create money out of thin air to buy bullets. This observation explains what central banks work so hard to preserve, but the implementation of #5 above will show how desperate the central banks have become and how little power they have left to prevent a systemic collapse. There are parallels to the waning days of the Soviet Union, which could not in the end prevent the fall of the Berlin Wall, let alone the collapse of its unconscionable people control system.

In short, banks and governments will no longer have the ability to work hand-and-glove toward their objectives, extortionate profits for the banks and unbridled power for governments. And it won't be a pretty sight.

The ultimate irony? The worst predictions of the Y2K doomsayers come true, but not because of computer problems and glitches. Rather, the monetary system built upon nothing but promises collapses because people finally realize that sometimes promises mean nothing, and if promises mean nothing, then the money from a monetary system built upon promises is worth nothing.

Time no longer allows me to read the other sites, so I depend on several others to send in clear thinking discussion (such as yours).
It looks like GS is following the concepts I presented from Another. Sad as it is they are selling short all the various paper derivatives attached to gold that their capital will allow and at the same time buying physical Gold. Others have been doing this prudent arbitrage for some time, only now it has become visible and the street is in total denial! The play they are following is easy to
understand, as the present paper gold market is going into discount with no way to arbitrage it from the opposite direction! More later FOA

Hello St. George,
I'll comment on your questions in order.

---Query to FOA: Sir; I would like to know what percentage of arab oil's physical gold holdings is actually in the hands of its owners? ie. within the respective owners national boundary as opposed to being in a vault "overseas" in NY or London etc. --------

SG, I really don't fully know. My understanding is that much of it is spread between Europe (Swiss?), London (that may have been changing the last year or so) and New York.
The following is a political answer that is more than troubling and confusing for most. For the sake of deep interesting thought, I'll throw it out here. No need to discuss, just think about it. A 007 type mind is needed to grasp it fully. Hard trading commodity types usually roll over with this one.

The first thought most westerners derive from this is that "oh, well, we have the gold so we'll just keep it if they don't give us the oil"! I don't often state this in writing, but I have to laugh at that joke of a thought! You see my friend, in this world black gold is far more valuable than yellow gold. It's just that very simple. For our lifetimes, the majority of the two most important items for commerce will both remain buried underground, gold bars in NY and oil in the ME. Another often said that "oil and gold never flow in the same direction". With that statement, most of us close our eyes and imagine a barrel of oil crossing the ocean while a gold bar sets in an airplane heading for the desert. In reality, as long as the worlds largest pool of oil is under that sand, their gold deposits are safe in
almost any government bank. Long standing protocols state the obvious: if the oil runs out, the gold is ours; if the gold runs out, the oil is ours! They get a warehouse receipt that says the gold is shipped when and if wanted, we get a warehouse receipt that says the oil is shipped when and if
wanted. Stated another way, they keep the hostage and demand that we hold the reward?
Well enough of that, this market is hard enough without adding more.

Your conclusion:
---------I believe this is an important fact to know for it will help answer the recurring theme/ question on this forum of WHEN? Assuming that there is increasing fear of defaults on paper gold contracts, are we now witnessing the owners of physical gold held overseas "backing up the truck" and taking their money home? For it is a matter of "trust in your banker" Finally, as gold is repatriated, the ability of the bullion banks to use this gold and engage in fractional reserve gold banking would seem to end and would answer the big question of WHEN?-----------Your comments are most appreciated. Thank You.

SG,
This new gold market is a vast sea of paper gold IOUs. We can divide the owners of those receipts into two groups, owners with major oil reserves and "everyone else". Because the world is so much more dependent on oil than it was in 1971 (the last time gold loans failed), oil producers will get their gold "no matter what"! Dam the citizens rights, war to the infidels, burn all books, but oil will flow! The only real problem for this failing gold market is what to do with the "everyone else"? I suspect that investors will lose their respect and money in the paper gold market when they
see the premiums on physical gold rise in a major way. If any person knows WHEN people will come to their sense, I reply as Another did "I would bow low before that knowledge".
Remember, even as Rome burned traders inside the city were still buying and selling houses. As the foreign armies were "pounding at the door", merchants gave runners orders for new supplies to buy. Nothing has changed. When / if gold closes in london at $50, someone will still say that you
should buy it there because it's a better value than wasting your money on $6,000 gold trading in the alley. And a better deal than $6,000 in the alley would be that gold mine for a nickel.

When someone has interest in this subject, they are forced to dig through all the other fine thoughts and perception presented here. It's important for them to also see everyone else's analysis because it shows how current events are disseminated into the minds of a community. Five people can hear one view and all come up with a different conclusion.
The long process (struggle?) of reviewing these conclusions, then balancing them against ongoing events
teaches people to read the news correctly. No one here is right or wrong, only events will prove all things true. For me, this forum is a world class one of a kind, that is as much about learning the human heart as it is about government and money. Inevitably, we all pour out our fears, dreams and aspirations while delving into the future of out life savings. Michael has done a brilliant job of drawing out the money conclusions everyone is hungry to read about. Just look at the Forum Contest Metal Winners posts, fantastic. In addition, our two Hall Of Fame posters are the written basics of where ORO is comming from.

The Western world is adrift in confusion when it comes to conservative money. We clamor to compare our thoughts to others, just to see if we are on the right track. Most are not. Another would never betray his friends by presenting private facts. This just isn't done in his world. So we
are told to look there, consider this, why not this way, they will do this if that occurs and so on. In this way we will not learn from him, rather we teach ourselves from the actions of others.

My last post (yesterdays forum?) became a short incomplete response as other pressing discussions took precedence. Sorry for that. Now I see where ORO (#11512 and #11497 thanks SteveH and Tomcat) has not only taken the ball, but is running with it. He is a fine example of how
someone has looked in the right places and found the truth. For most investors, this ongoing affair has been torture. They have been caught with the wrong strategy for eventually benefiting from this transition. Without the knowledge of how gold is really valued it's difficult to walk away from old losing ideas. But, the process continues, with or without us. More on GS in a little while. FOA

Gold Shorts
In the GOLD-EAGLE editorials today is a note from Sunil Madhok on the CB gold leasing mess. In the editorial he makes the following points. He mentions the amount of the loans ~14,000 tons although I understand that no-one really knows the true number.
As to the reason for leasing their gold, he states:
"They leased out their Gold not because they wanted to earn the lease money, but to provide liquidity to the markets. The purpose of lending was to prevent a squeeze due to short-term increase in demand and/or cornering of the market by big speculators.
Because we now have a physical shortage, he continues:
"For mining production to exceed demand, the price of Gold must go up significantly. If the price of Gold does go up significantly, then some big bullion Banks may go bankrupt. One big failure would result in chain of defaults. It appears that some CBs now realize this and, therefore, are planning to sell their Gold reserves just to bail out some market players who are short. It is possible that the
Bank of England made the controversial decision to sell their Gold reserves in order to protect some bullion Banks. It is also possible that for the same reason some other CBs may be ready to sell their Gold reserves, whenever the price of Gold starts shooting upwards."
Obviously, the BOE supply is a drop in the bucket compared to 14,000. But the US and other European countries, such as Switzerland (which talked of selling, I think 1300 tonnes?) easily have enough gold.
My question is: Why would not the CBs that have lent the gold simply sell it to the borrowers? as he states. Would this not prevent or at least limit a meltdown in the financial markets that everyone is expecting? Or are the CBs simply not willing to sell it? Or are the problems so much bigger than this that it alone would not undo the damage?

Hello Phos,
First, go to the USAGOLD Hall Of Fame and read the posts there by Aristotle and Aragorn.

To comment on your question: They don't sell because they have the economic lives of other people to protect. As an example, if you were broke and owed a ton of money, would you sell your fully paid for house to pay your debts? In the process put your very family on the streets and subject them to exposure and difficult living conditions. In the human logic of things, most people won't and don't! They let the banker "eat it" first.

In the absolute same context we must view the "Major CBs". Only the major ones count because all the others fall under the shadow of the money systems of the majors. Yes Belgium sold most of it's leased gold to paper holders and other CBs, yet it was coming under the Euro umbrella. England is a case in transition as they must now move from the dollar realm into the Euro arena if they are to survive. So, they also close their lease books. The Swiss thing is a joke because they too are posturing to enter the EMU and will absolutely be selling gold to the ECB for Euros! Believe it! But the Major CBs countries that back the dollar or the Euro?

Look at the US. Will they cover? Well, if they didn't dump their gold to honor dollars at $42 / ounce in the 71, why do it now? Everyone that held dollars as a gold loan, was told to "eat it", we are keeping the gold! Further, why doesn't the US Treasury exchange their gold for outstanding
treasury debt that earns interest. Yes, dump the gold on the market for $42, why not? If we follow the logic of England, they should have used their own created pounds to buy the gold and just given it away.

This current generation buys into these fairy tale assumptions as logical because they haven't seen what happens in a currency "wipeout". We'll get one soon enough and when it does, they will also tell the gold loan holders to "eat it", I'm not putting my country (family) on the street.

No, my friend, they will only cover in tiny amounts if that action can prolong the system. As we head into large scale discounting of paper gold and outright default, they will walk away for the same reasons you would. thanks FOA

Mr. Insider....
Talked with Mr. Insider about this morning's price drop. He says Goldman Sachs is selling on paper -- major selling. Goldman is also taking delivery on another 725 COMEX gold contracts.
(You figure it out.)

Michael, It's kind of "unbelievable" isn't it? Is it possible that "all along", GS has from way back seen the failure of this modern system of pricing gold? When the BOE sale went off, GS starting right away selling against the market. Well, if you were an "in the know" mender of LBMA and saw the BOE sale as a stopgap measure to patch a failing system, what would you do?

As long as the physical community had supply and continued to price it's product based on Comex / London, I would buy (take delivery) whatever physical was offered in size on the off market at ever falling prices. Sell the LME or future dates on Comex then start taking delivery on
spot month as other supplies dry up! Look at how slow it's arriving now. In the old days, several million ounces would be there in a minute. Warren Buffet would have to have a piece of this new action?

Why doesn't some big player call the shorts? The Bunker Hunt fiasco is still fresh in their minds. If anyone tries to call for "big product" on the paper exchanges the regulators will just revert to cash settlement. So there is no way to play it against them on a large scale. It will all end when no supplies arrive for the front months. The whole thing, London and all will go to cash settlement just as the 71 dollar did. The end of the gold market as we know it? So far it's following Another's thoughts. Ideas from anyone else??

Cage Rattler ("Gold was a store of value throughout ancient times, however money NEVER was!" - M Armstrong) ID#33182:
Copyright © 1999 Cage Rattler/Kitco Inc. All rights reserved

----------Dear Bob:
You are making the opposite mistake of Karl Marx. Marx assumed that everyone in the private sector was corrupt and therefore that property held in the hands of government would be fairly managed. Marx never accounted for human nature and it doesn't matter if control over money is
private or public, both have historically tended to exploit it for personal gain.
Money is ONLY a medium of exchange and it is NOT, and has NEVER BEEN a store of value. Gold in itself has been a store of value as demonstrated in Korea and Asia. Gold was a store of value throughout ancient times, however money NEVER was! These are two separate issues that should not be confused.-----------

From FOA.
To the contrary, Mr. M, these are two separate confusions that deal with the same issue! Your assumptions always conclude that the values established in a public "marketplace" represent the private views of the majority of people. In other words, if someone trades anything using the
marketplace price and using the accepted mediums, the mechanics of that trade must also represent the mind set of the person. Through out history, it rarely has. Your view is further skewed with the "control over money" issue. The world has always assumed that the "people" want someone to control the money, be it public or private.
When one looks closely into the private actions and reactions of people during various civilizations, the mindset of the majority (the average citizen) was always that we don't need "money at all". Just let us alone so we can trade our things. The modern argument of the Public vs Private "control" always found the banks as representative of the term "Private" and the government put forth as "public". The "free market citizen" was never considered as a viable contender to pick the trading medium.
Banks, long ago assumed the roll of making and controlling money for private interest because they saw that the "free citizen marketplace" seemed to always use gold to trade with You say:

-----Money is ONLY a medium of exchange and it is NOT, and has NEVER BEEN a store of value------

The problem with this is that in the old "free" marketplace, these people never thought of there use of gold as using "money"! It was only a "thing" that most of them found to be the best item to trade with. For them (again average people) gold held it's own particular independent store of value just like anything else they owned. Indeed, in their mind it wasn't the "medium of exchange" money concept of the bankers in a later time. I submit that even the term of "money" in the early bible was not in the same banker context. Back them it was more closely associated with a "thing of personal value" that could just as easily be "used" as traded. Therefore your statement,

---Gold was a store of value throughout ancient times, however money NEVER was!-----

does not present a valid conception for comparison. It was the banks that, in the assumed roll of creating money for commerce, decided to make and control the "CONTENT OF THEIR CREATED MONEY". In this action, by no means did they
represent the perceptions of people who can be depicted as the third party in this debate of control. Yes, banks were owned by private interest, but that should not imply that they presented the private viewpoint. Yes, the people did use the created money (both coin and paper receipt) for
trading, but the mindset of that early evolution did not hold that this "bank money" was solely a "medium of exchange" Rather it was a receipt for a tradeable item of use. The "medium" only concept came into play as the banks lent out more receipts than they had or they could not collect upon failed "real gold loans". That excess of gold receipts in circulation could then be perceived as the "medium of exchange modern banking concepts refer to". We then clearly proceeded to the era you next present ( as it is explained in reverse):

-------- The Greeks, Romans and everyone along the way ALWAYS and WITHOUT EXCEPTION played with the gold content of their coinage which led to Gresham's Law - good money drives out bad money. Whenever money was debased, older issues of higher metal content were hoarded. They then ceased to be MONEY (medium of exchange) and became a (STORE OF VALUE).--

With the clear viewpoint that I presented above, we can see that this next statement does not apply to a post contraction "free market trading arena". Rather it is the present conjecture, using the present thinking in a prosperity mode mindset that assumes the private and public terms as the only viewpoint. They are only two parts of a three part society.

-------If you think that a return to a gold standard in some way will eliminate these issues, you are wrong! No matter if it is the private sector or the public sector, whoever ends up in charge will always play games. -----------

Indeed, if a true free market in gold was established and all gold was coined and sold into the market place, games would still occur. However, new concepts for hard times would require mines to make all coins to conform to set standards and pay their taxes to governments with the same
(however high that might be). In addition, they would pay their help and buy supplies with the same. Private stores of gold (both government and private) could choose if they wanted their bullion coined or not for a fee. Yes, the value of gold would gold very high compared to real things, but it did that long ago, before banks called it a "medium". Anyone that owned gold would be rich. So what? Anyone today with a lot of cash is rich, again so what? Gold money is spent and loaned and in general always circulated. Just as in the early days before banks and gold was just another
thing of wealth, but not the only store of wealth in a persons portfolio of things. Yes, Banks and governments would fail and go bankrupt as they always did. Yet, the money supply would never be changed because of their failures. People that loan gold money would learn not to count that asset loan as part of the money supply as today.

Further on you state:

-----Gold is a store of value today - but it is NOT money. It is NOT acceptable to pay your VISA, rent or to buy food unless on a barter basis. Only dollars ( money ) is acceptable in the US, and now Russia while it may be yen, marks francs, deniers or whatever in other nations.-------

Again, you assume that gold is not money because it is not accepted as "the medium" in the Government / Bank operating economic system. I submit that this perception represents a short conclusion. If we extend the thought we find that no government or bank said that gold was not
money. They only decided to not "use" gold as "legal tender money". Both of these entities chose to pursue this route because they wanted to create more "money" than was in existence. Something they could not accomplish it using a money that possesed a "store of value".
As I pointed out, the "citizen" and their trading are the "private free market" that the world economy is and has always been based on. This market place does not need "more created money" as it worked fine using the old "store of value gold" as long as the market could increase or
decrease it's purchasing power as measured against all goods and services. Banks and governments fought hard to stop this function because it took power away from them and returned
it to the economy.
As a result, history proves how poor of a job government and bank paper money has done without using gold. Your description that follows is an excellent example of the battle between the first party governments and the second party banking systems. The third party private person will
be impacted from this abuse of the money system, however, our heart was never in it. Your words:

----- I simply disagree with your interpretation of 1929, the Fed and the wildcat banking era. Your view of anti-central bank was shared by Andrew Jackson who was bitter because he had lost money and was turned down for loan in his youth. When he became President, he destroyed the Bank of the United States and with no central control, the entire banking system quickly fell into trouble. There are countless "broken bank" notes that collectors can buy today from every little one-horse town in the country. Some were in the hands of local politicans who quickly exploited the system and bankrupted their communities. The Constitution specifically prohibited the States from issuing money and because of the hyperinflation of the 1700s.
You are also misinterpreting dictating private investments with restrictions of asset class and leverage. You now have a perfect example of your no interference policy for the private sector. Long Term Capital has just blown up by leveraging positions to the extent of $1 trillion. The
uncontrolled activity of this one hedge fund is going to disrupt the free markets everywhere in ways you have not yet even noticed. There needs to be a rule of law that establishes the basic guide lines. It should NOT expand into regulation of every aspect over investment. What an individual does with his own money is his own business. However, when institutional money is gathered and used
at the discretion of fund managers who buy into the latest hype like Russia, then allowing this type of investment to be carried out with ANY restrictions whatsoever, is extremely dangerous. LTCM is a significant threat to both bonds and stocks right now. A few other funds are now rumored to be in a similar position. Such unbridled leverage threatens to bring down a lot more than anyone
suspects. I think there will be investigations and a whole new set of regulations that will come out of this debacle. The Fed is currently calling around the street in an attempt to assess the damage. There will come a day when you will see that the proposal of that I have made to merely
regulate asset class will be far more attractive after the next set of regulations come storming out from all government bodies that will seek to restrict every aspect of investment. What they don't understand - they ultimately kill.
Your argument for no regulation will not even be seriously considered by any government body I have ever testified before. In reality, there may be no way out, because the people themselves will demand action because they have lost money in stocks caused by hedge funds in Russia and interest rates like LTCM. They will in the end bare the blame and a host of new regulations will spring forth in an effort to appease the people who demand government action.

From FOA.
Sir, I have commented on your thoughts because it is important to present the flaw in this perception. Some of your analysis is in the context of a rebuilding of the government / banking financial system after a great contraction. It places little support to gold as a choice to preserve wealth during this event as gold will not be in demand.
I submit that you have misread the historical attraction to gold that private citizens impart upon this metal. The human factor always has and always will gravitate to using things as trading items. We were born a people of earth with senses that touch, see and feel for value Weather our trading things can be considered money, a medium of exchange, legal tender or a store of value, was never the issue. Governments and banks made them an issue so as to circumvent our value of trade for their benefit.
As such, when the next downturn threatens to destroy the perceived values created in fiat currencies and securities, people will then circumvent these modern concepts and return to trading the most convenient things. History, not modern computer research, has shown that we will return to gold.

Thank You for your time. FOA

Gold Price Sinks Due To Sheer Weight of Paper.
August 21st, 1999

Professor von Braun
The Rocket School of Economics.

There is no question that the "paper gold" market is considerably larger than the actual physical gold market. Estimates we have seen range from a minimum of 90 to 1 to in
excess of 100 to 1 paper ounce contracts being written for every single ounce of gold that changes hands. This is mind boggling.

The paper gold market is not in the slightest bit concerned about such things as supply and demand numbers and anybody who is relying on these numbers and such comments as increased demand for physical metal to make investment decisions, fails to see the significance of what's going on here.

We clearly have an aberration here that is unique. No true futures market could operate this way for too long since there is not enough gold around to cover the positions that
have accrued.

In a sense, there is now two markets within one and considerable confusion will result if this is not understood. The usage of gold has changed in the sense that now its the bullion banks that write the paper contracts (using other entities reserves), as opposed to a central bank printing paper currencies that have some form of gold backing.

This activity really began its current expansionary phase after gold peaked in February of 1996. The downside has been continuous since that time and the number of contracts
written favoring the shortside has increased year after year. The price has of course correspondingly declined.

Eventually supply and demand will have its way and the long awaited and often referred to short squeeze will appear, but at present the odds still favor the shortsellers. They are onto such a good thing and still maintain the ability it seems, to stay at least one step ahead of the game. It is unlikely it will end just yet. Lurking in the background is the issue of the IMF gold reserves and a potential sale. Never mind the political resistance to this sale, the odds favor it happening and politicians stated resistance has a habit of disappearing when the time comes to vote. In this case, the IMF needs the cash and the alternative (US taxpayers) may be even more unpalatable.

Markets have a habit of correcting aberrations caused by the greed of the players whether they like it or not. As we all know, most "flavors of the month" are "too good to last", and this paper gold market is no exception.

Casinos, those wonderful places that have replaced the town meeting halls of the last century, have rules and certain guidelines that must be followed. Most of these rules and
guidelines reflect such things as odds given, credit extended, mild (and legal) intimidation, and so on. The gambling industry for the most part, is self- policing because of the risk. It is their cash they stand to lose.

Consequently, while there are some exceptions, the odds given in the various games of chance don't change all that much from casino to casino. But most bean counters fail to
realize that their little universe is not the epi-center of whatever industry they are in and lose sight of the fact of what they are and are not, in control of. From a casinos point of view its Achilles heel is people through the door and money on the tables.

Las Vegas is a good example of this in the sense that you have a market that has expanded rapidly since 1986. Expanded ? How about exploded in terms of growth and new casinos.

Like the current paper gold sellers boom, the industry players all convinced themselves that they needed to expand and many new casinos now dominate the Las Vegas skyline,
such as it is. In doing so the bean counters all ignored their own rules and guidelines and have now created one of the biggest ongoing traffic snarl ups in the southwest, created a shortage of skilled staff and put the towns sewage system under strain. Oh dear. Using greed as a fertilizer for growth always produces unexpected results.

The "too much of a good thing" syndrome begins to come into play and the activity, regardless of what it is, tips itself over, or self corrects. Nature may abhor a vacuum but it
abhors an aberration as well.

So too with the paper gold business which has of course grown out of the actual trading of physical metal, but now dominates it to such a degree that it is beginning to impact on the realities of supply, demand and more importantly, the potential for increasing new supply. Why mine gold at these price levels ? Obviously, more metal is not needed.

But watch out when the paper gold supply turns to the physical market for its redemption's. That indeed will be an interesting day.

A run for physical?
Welcome ORO!

TownC,
Am I reading this market correctly? Is an LBMA member selling future dated gold paper (for all to see) and buying physical (for all to see)? If one member is buying physical "in the open", will others soon follow (in the open)? If the OI on the Comex gold options calls is above 400,000, will a run for physical create a rush to call (convert / take delivery) for Comex contracts? Will OI on Comex then surge the same amount?

ORO, Perhaps we should forget the money and "follow the gold"!

And this was from my
Aristotle (8/15/99; 18:35:22MDT - Msg ID:11214)
----- Doesn't it strike anyone as significant that this Gold was not acquired on the spot market, but rather through the odd route of using futures contracts? If you have explored the link I referred koan to, the analogy here is that Goldman Sachs has only thus far succeeded in getting themselves a fistful of paper dollars in the 1920's, and they have announced their intentions of walking down to the bank to have these paper contracts honored with real Gold. -----------

Ari, I'm going to ramble a minute then get to your comment. It's a testimony to how many major gold players (not talking about GS) use some form of future delivery paper as the real thing. They don't really want to hold real gold as that would require "buying it for delivery". Because paper gold only requires 10% to 20% (or less) to hold, the rest of the money can be put to better use. They pick up the future derivatives (I'm talking about all the various gold arena's) and hold until it moves somewhat close to delivery. Then, before delivery, they sell and run further out. All of this is done with a mind set of "we are only holding this gold as a hedge against our portfolio, so paper will do
fine". This thinking has, over the years, progressed till it represents most of the major Western public investment money.
With this view, is it no wonder that the large bullion houses rule the paper market. It's easy to sell (short) the outdated derivatives because all that is needed is cash! As the market slowly falls, the short equity requirements become nonexistent. To the advantage of the houses, the longs practically always settle up in cash and move on. The large funds don't want the trouble of real gold so they continue to play this game of "let's bet on the gold price and see who is right"! Today, they are learning a painful lesson that the stated price for gold is established by the same derivatives that they don't want to exercise. In their world, they are convinced that massive physical gold is but a phone call away for shipment into certified warehouses, so the derivatives price must truly reflect the real market.
Today, anyone that is "blind in one eye" (Another's favorite) should be able to see how easy it's been to maneuver gold lower without impacting physical. As I pointed out in other posts, it's the private Western stores of bullion that have been slowly fed in to fill most of the physical deficit and replaced with derivatives holdings. In essence, a lot of conservative entities have brought into this new gold market and now hold derivative gold as the real thing. Truly, their trading up has helped to legitimize this market as this "Old Physical" was delivered to some who demanded it.
Add to this, the enormous number of completely new investors that have entered the gold arena as paper players and we can see just how large demand is. When this market fails, those who traded "Old Physical" are going to be head first into what ever physical market is left (or newly
established). To fully grasp their ability, one must realize that they were just "hedging" a much larger portfolio against some future problem. If the world markets begin to falter at the same time that the paper gold market begins to unravel, "extremely emotional money" is going to be moving, big time!
All of the above has nothing to do with the huge international government and private bullion investors that hold and move gold as a currency. During a breakdown, whatever gold they do control, will be "locked down" for the duration! Believe it! Like I said before Yhey will reply
something like this:

"yea, I wrote calls on my bullion, but things have changed and I moved it (fraguently) out of your grasp just in time. So send your army or sue me"

Build this dynamic into the size of the Yen carry and Gold carry trade and you will understand it's impact.
Back to your comment: You bet it's "significant that this Gold was not acquired on the spot market". Even if they (GS) are acting for a client, they, as a LBMA member should have easily been able to secure spot bullion. I can tell you that they are no longer acting out a long term plan to
support the dollar by lowering the derivative gold price. RR is gone and Green S is right behind him. The US official stance is about to change reguarding gold because the entire IMF system is comming apart. The action and price in gold look like the same "low gold / dollar is good" maneuver, but it's not. In reality, their open physical purchase is a defining picture of a failing gold marketplace. They aren't just going to hold this unmanageable position that is simular to those 1920s dollars and watch them devalue. They are out to make something as the paper gold market is discounted into oblivion. Your analogy is correct in the comparison, but there is little they can do. Just as everyone was trapped long ago in old "gold loan" dollars held outside the domestic US market, only one course remained. Short the dollar for all you were worth. It did plunge for some time, back then. Today, with the whole market in denial about what the true price of gold is,
common sense requires one to sell paper gold short if it cannot deliver. Who in the hell is going to arbitrage it from the other side. Will someone put 500 million long and go to court to settle? What if they Bunker Hunt it? You're out, big! I think this falure is going to make Y@K look like a walk in the park. We shall see.
This is the hailstorm of events that GATA is leading gold stock investors into. If the present gold market explodes to the upside in a paper covering run, it will shut down every major bullion bank in the world. It cannot be allowed to happen. I think most readers know just how that will play out. Every bit of financing arranged with just about every mine in existence will be locked down, as in
collateral seizure. Without an established (read that official) gold market (none will exist for some time), no mine will be allowed to sell to anyone. Place yourself in the context of events, the governments will be trying to grapple with the failure of most of the currency markets, let alone hold together these banks. They are not about to let some major underground equity just float off and be
sold as the stockholders wish. Think about it?

Aristotle, a different view from a different perspective for everyone to see. You fully well understand all of this much more than even your finest posts show. (smile) FOA

Things are definitely getting interesting!
Is Japan's current absence from intervention on the forex markets (as seen in recent-past operations to maintain strength of the dollar/yen) also symptomatic of the end-game you've hinted at in that passage, or an unrelated affair?

Aristotle, more thinking placed on the table.
End-game? It could be, it just could be. There are so many different windows to view this event from, it makes it difficult to stay in context while discussing the "why's" and "what for" of the various players. Most of my last post to you was given looking through a window at the typical American investment professional. For so long they reached for the "leveraged play" as an avenue to hedge with gold. In their mind, because the recent record of gold indicated it's price would always rise in the face of currency inflation, they didn't need to hold it, just gain from it's rise. Their use of paper is understandable because almost every portfolio in America is some form of derivative, not direct
deed in hand ownership. Be it stocks, bonds even the currency. Sense derivatives are only bookkeeping assets that indicate a value in something else, the concept of paper gold worked fine to balance risk. Indeed, on paper this balance has worked because the bulk of the portfolio that
was to be hedged has performed very well. The risk side of the equation has yet to be tested.

Only now, eyes beginning to open as to what is happening. Yes, the massive dollar currency inflation has exploded worldwide and inflated financial assets only. However, what if the risk they hedged against, real price inflation, will arrive during the destruction of the derivatives market before it devalues the dollar. The markets themselves may fail and no longer function in their ability to offset risk. We are seeing this in the Yen as it's dynamics is crushing the Yen carry trade.
Eventually, there trades will become so far under that they cannot be unwound. The same is happening in the paper gold trade. The very vehicles that people use to manage risk are the items that will fail, bringing on the financial destruction. Now we see why there is no gold of size out
there, even as it's derivatives are sold down. Worldwide, real gold inventories are being locked down as players perceive their predicament. The dollar reserve currency arenas offer little to lock down. How do we "get physical" with the Yen?

Going back further in time: In this fertile ground was born the beginnings of the BIS maneuver to expand the ownership of gold without increasing the demands on physical supply. It solved several problems and yet ironically set in motion the eventual destruction of the dollar from it's own weight. Real gold could be diverted into areas that kept the system alive until the Euro was born (low price of oil in dollar terms). In addition, because the dollar is but a unit of confidence, a spiking "real" gold price (perhaps on a black market) would someday create a stampede out of that currency. That is why a new currency, of size was needed to receive that flow if the world economy was to have any chance to survive. The Euro didn't arrive to destroy the dollar, it was created as a place to run when this present system falls. That is why it's so important to the middle eastern oil producers. The MEast, China, India, eastern Europe and Russia will all eventually fall into the EMU, if not in reality, then from actual trade transactions. The ECB has made it plain to everyone that they will not restrain the Euro up or down. This clean float will be the very reason everyone runs to it, especially the up side of the equation. Every Euro critic in America will be among the first to buy it when the dollar starts to fail.

The events surrounding the Euro and gold have yet to begin. The entire dynamic is only just coming into sight for most thinkers. When Another spoke of gold and oil backing the Euro, it made little sense and still doesn't completely add up in the current context. Later, with the dollar / IMF
system coming unwound, the same writers that speak of the Euro as "just another fiat currency" will be discussing how it's only so strong because of ?????? We shall see.

Wouldn't we have been smart if the Western governments had gone to OPEC when the prices were low and offered them *help* in the form of buying future production at prices 10,20,30 percent higher than the 10-12 dollar prices per barrel we saw earlier this year. That would have been interesting when you compare it to buying the PM mines future production. yes?

I share GT's question. To paraphrase; "the bullion banks cannot be allowed to fail". I posted several days ago wondering if the "crisis" could somehow be managed or negotiated. I realize that was naivete but still I wonder. Why can't the market be manipulated to let the air out a little by sacrificing a few innocent lambs (none innocent really)and controlling the damage as the POG moves upwards? If I understand you correctly, that doesn't appear to be an option as the "damage control" will consist of siezing collateral (mines)in the event of default. That is a logical progression of cause/event but almost too difficult to believe!

GT and CM,
From my standpoint, most of the gold paper market will revert to forced cash settlement at the last trade! That's for long investors only because it's the inability of the shorts to deliver that will precipitate this. They will be taken out and shot because the CBs will be clearing the deals. If it's dropped to $100 and established trading markets halted worldwide because of sudden delivery
demands, everyone will settle at $100, cash and walk away! People that are waiting to sell their hedged gold into their counterparties (mines included ABX?? to the BBs) would have to sell their gold at the new settlement price. Remember, when big international bankers are in trouble on this grand of a scale, the rules are changed into the banks favor. Always has been, always will be.

Understand, that the BIS clears all trade in CB gold. If that gold is tied up in private Bullion Bank deals, it will come under their rule. The BIS tells the Government what needs to be done and the Governments tell the mines. In perspective, this will be happening in every industry, worldwide, not just gold. Everyone will lose some skin.

Perhaps, now we can see why any capital that's left will be pouring into real gold if it can be found anywhere. We don't have to believe it now, unfolding events will drive it home, soon enough. Thanks FOA

Mr. T Cat,
You make a good point, but it didn't work that way the last time Precious metal derivatives got in trouble. You write:
----Once the US nationalized the BBs they would have the authority to go to the "physical gold" owner, who wrote calls etc, and, at the point of a gun, complete the call and collect the gold. ---

When Mr. Hunt wanted delivery, the government didn't pull a gun on the shorts and make them deliver. During small cases they do, but the bigger the problem the more irretractable it becomes.

-------Settlements could take place with silver and platinum as well.------

In the same light, they didn't settle silver with physical gold, did they? Not then, not now.

-----------Which government would take over the LBMA?------

The LBMA will be disbanded and it's member banks and brokers dealt with by the governments that each bank is established in.

-----------It will not be a rapid collapse but will be a gradual phasing out of the old system.---

True, not a rapid collapse, rather an immediate shutting down of trading of any instrument that people are running from. The "gradual phasing" part is implemented once your assets are blocked. My friend, no one sits still when they are being relieved of their wealth. Looks good in theory, but in reality we are organic beings of emotion!

Endgame among not so clearcut adversaries?!?

CB2,
Good point. I have one view for what you write:

-----So why hold on to bad debt paper scrip if the endgame between $/IMF and Euro/Bis was so clear-cut policy as FOA feels, all along.---------

There is no possible way that the CBs could ever sell or unload all of those dollars. Presently they are held in the form of US treasury debt. It's owned by the CBs not their public / private interest. So, the CBs would not be looking to "spend" these reserves in the usual sense. They
obtained these reserves as their local economy generated excess sales to the US (for them a trade surplus) and their private citizens wanted to hold local currency assets, not dollars. The Cbs printed Marks (example) and traded with their citizens for these excess dollars. Then they traded these dollars for US debt so as to earn interest.

Now, exactly what good are these debt holdings as long as their country continues to carry a trade dollar surplus? Not much, if the locals don't want to hold dollar assets. In the end, if the CBs were to sell these treasury holdings it would crater the US debt markets long before any value was
received. And, to add further, that value could only come from using the dollars to buy something. Now what does a Cb use it's reserves to buy, cars, TVs, other currencies??

No, the only avenue to balance currency value is through the age old asset of gold. Indeed, if you already hold enough gold, one just uses the dollars to bid for gold until the dollars become worthless (price of gold spikes to the sky). Usually only the intention to bid is enough?

------what I was grasping for is the connection with this analogy to the gold industry is how the industry wasn't wary like OPEC with their own product. This manipulation could have been prevented had they OPEC'ed themselves. Do you agree?------

Al, it's true that the mining industry could have done a better job of managing their product. But, would they have been allow to? Just prior to OPEC and the 1971 gold window close, all the major nations were still trying to work out a common ground with respect to gold. The price was so low
that few mines were making anything more than subsistence. The governments were finding that they could no longer use gold as money because they needed to cheat on the currency. The US wanted the price of gold to run up so as to spike the oil price and obtain more local production. Something they couldn't do competing against the nickel a barrel ME producers. As gold rose, the mines didn't need any production agreements so no one sought one. Through out the 80s everyone was expecting gold to regain it's trend, so again , no need for collusion. It's only been in the 90s,
especially during and right after the gulf war that the industry began to smell a rat. Hell, even two years ago, Another's Thoughts about manipulation were dismissed as crazy. Now, the industry sees they are in a battle for their lives as their asset is at the center of a realignment of world currencies.

Truly, if gold is repriced high enough, as a competing currency, the falloff in jewelry demand will negate the need for any additional supply. At extreme prices, the CBs could supply the market for years to come without impairing their asset reserves. Production curbs on the mines could again
restrict them to minimal profits even if gold was in the tens of thousands. A mess indeed.

-----Also, you stated: "In the same light, they didn't settle silver with physical gold, did they? Not then, not now."
Could you expand on this a bit. Clearly I am missing the boat on something fundamental. If physical gold was not available why wouldn't silver or platinum be an option?-

Tomcat,
I took your statement to ask the question (in my words), "if gold is unavailable for settlement, then why couldn't they use silver or platinum?".
If I'm in the right context, then my reply was a
comparison to the period when the Comex changed settlement on the Hunts. My analogy was that with silver in short supply for delivery, they didn't try to use gold as a substitute. A reverse to your question.
In my experience, when things become so convoluted a regular "everybody settle up now" doesn't work. So, the system is just stopped in it's tracks. Some lose big, some small.

--------Working for a large bullion bank , I know for a fact that a lot of Gold accumulated by Middle eastern investors is regularly offered for leasing purposes. This baffles me. They are negating the very reason why they invest in GOLD by lending it with the risk of facing a default by their counterparts. Maybe FOA could give us some of his insights about that fact.---

Hello Rainman,
I can't help you there. Another may if he sees this??? My view of that is much the same as yours, it's baffling. I would also have to ask the question, "who is helping who" in that situation? Perhaps the BB needs some gold? Fees are also a consideration, as in who gets them!

------When considering the Euro versus the US $ , a lot of people on this forum expect the Euro to
eventually overtake the $.--------

I don't look for the Euro to so much overtake the dollar as for the dollar to fall away. I know it's the same outcome, but this perspective brings us more into context. The Euro is much younger than the dollar and certainly has less baggage in the form of a trade deficit overhang. The dollar has been building up a huge float in foreign hands for 20 or thirty years. It's that mass of currency that's unneeded for Euro zone commerce (or the rest of the world for that matter). ORO wrote a beautiful piece the other day, pointing out how the ME countries could ask the question, why are
we using the dollar when the Euro could work just as well? In addition, I point out that the Euro is governed by a diverse group of countries with different interest. That very point sets it in better standing compared to the dollar that is controlled by the interest of one country, the USA.

---However , there is something that I don't understand. Either fiat currencies disappear, and the Euro will have the same fate as the $. (The Euro is no more backed by Gold than the $. The ECB has a certain amount of GOLD in currency reserves and the regional banks like the BUBA , Bank of France or Bank of Italy have a lot more but so does the FED ) Or fiat currencies survive by some mysterious alchemy and from a pure economic perspective , over the long term , the
claims on US assets by $ holders are much more valuable than those on European assets since the US has already won the economic and geostrategic war.-----

Well, I don't expect the fiat currencies to disappear. Look at Brazil or Mexico? Years (decades) of regular currency death and they still use the dam things. A testimony to the persistence of mankind. In a similar light, I expect the US dollar to be devalued on a grand scale. Yes, it will most likely stay in use, only, like these other countries, it will be worth a lot less. Indeed, I can picture the American citizens using cash Euros to store wealth and make trades, just as others do presently using dollars. Say, in Canada?

Your presumption that the foreign dollars are more valuable as claims on US production should be adjusted to include a true accounting of just how many are outstanding. A little research will show that these dollars would buy up almost all of our production for decades! The real problem is that we are still in a deficit trade condition. If these dollars are unneeded to buy now, how could they become more valuable later? If we don't have enough to sell them using current trade, what would they buy using all the additional float? Remember, these countries in Europe have assets for their people to invest in and goods and services for them to buy. They don't need to buy from us on a scale that the dollar overhang would require.
As for economic wars, they are never won, rather always ongoing. Thanks FOA

I see there are a couple of posts here this evening that are not pro-gold and perhaps for good reason(s). Do you have a repartee?

CM,
Yes, it is sad when someone gets hit without a clear knowledge of why. Unfortunately there will be more of this because investors are unprepared for the times ahead. We could see gold go through tremendous swings as this is unwound.

Long term booms (20 years +??) always die with major loses inflicted on the most leveraged positions. Add to this a once in a century destruction in the most popular currency, and we produce an economic earthquake the likes of which no one has ever seen.

Most investors retain their life savings in a fully invested mode and would not get off these train tracks if they saw two engines coming. They will stay there because it's impossible for them to believe they occupy the wrong position! Who can lay blame or call them fools? These typical western savers have been educated to believe in a money system that serves no purpose, except a medium of exchange. Yet, they perceive that all of their assets are correctly valued by this system.

The gold market suffers the same fate. The same ideals that hold us in bank accounts, using credits to indicate what is on deposit, also drive us to invest in gold assets that must be sold to realize a profit. Modern gold bugs travel from bank accounts into paper gold and back into the
same bank accounts. All the while pointing out the weakness of the system, yet needing the same system to keep score. Without the modern paper gold market, gold bugs, as we know them are lost to place a value on their holdings. That is why they gravitate into familiar gold holdings. Ones that still retain some connection to their paper currency. Mine stocks (and various option / futures) are a likely choice as they sit squarely upon the financial system we know most.

Great swings in asset preference always bring monumental profits. However, these profits will be shared by only a very few. And those few will have to endure gut wrenching blows to their assets when this storm hits. Gold will by no means be safe and it will not be secure. But in comparison to every other form of wealth, it will be the most well known and sought after asset on the planet.

I think, many will be weeded out from this market as events unfold. Most of them never expected the fluctuations occurring now and they would be horrified at what may come. However, what they retreat into will be completely cleaned out. Completely! As for those that are sharp enough to buy when the proverbial blood is running in the streets? Time and events will prove that they were not as smart or quick as they thought.

Having said that, paper gold may rally, gold stocks could storm up and physical could just sit there. But that won't be the end of it and such an action would simply draw more into the fire. I remain steadfast to what Another once said:

" when a thousand hungry lions fight over one scrap of food small dogs should hide with what's in their belly"

This dog is well fed with gold and hidden deep in it's history. Thanks FOA

@ FOA : Thks for your answer
The 2 countries which by far outweight any other country in the European Union are France and Germany. Both of them have retirement systems which are based on active workers paying for retired workers. Unlike the US or UK , unaccounted
claims run in the trillions of Euros in the next 20 years which is a crucial problem since there are less and less active salarymen per active men.---------

Yes, I well know that problem, having studied it for some time. I hae relatives in Germany that also expressed the same concern. What you described above is the same quandary faced in this country by the Social Security system. The comparison between the cost to these separate
societies is clouded from the reporting by the respective governments. In Europe, the facts and figures are very open, available and contain honest evaluations regarding the eventual impact. Alarming as they are, at least no one is hiding anything. In the US, the cost of our SS system is
completely overwhelming to the future generations, yet it is glossed over as manageable. How can anyone believe even these government SS projections (perhaps they are worse) when the same people state that our national debt is turning to surplus even as the actual debt figures are growing
daily. And, unlike Europe, these manageable figures are projected into the future using a continuation of our current GDP. We are currently running at the highest long term rate in history and that is coming off an economic expansion of some eight years+.

You use the GDP in this section:

--------In France , a man making real money will pay a marginal tax rate of 74 % including social taxes. Even though the money supply denominated in Euros is smaller than the one denominated in $ adjusting for respective GDP , the fiscal and social overhang are unmanageable in Europe . (I am french )---------

I point out that historically money supplies in major economies never shrink much. They remain a constant in fiat currency systems. Governments use the GDP as a tool to indicate if their respective social programs can be accomplished What good is that in justifying a debt burden? If a fiat money supply is always static or growing, it leaves the GDP as the variable. Because economic expansions
(GDP) expand and contract it changes the picture of a debt burden dramatically.

If two years from now we see the Euro zone in a major expansion and the US in a contraction, all the critics of Europe will rewrite their analysis of Socialism in Europe. Many say the Eurozone cannot expand without the US, why not? They did before, and that was at a time when Europe had
to import Americas inflation because of the Dollar reserve system. Today, an expansion in Europe would have "legs of it's own" in a Euro currency concept. See today's WSJ for some bullish theory.

Our (US) national debt and SS commitments loom far more ominous when viewed in the light of a reduction of growth back to "normal"! Again, comparing respective social financing needs of these two economic zones pales as a problem when their respective currencies considered.

-------Technological innovation in the US is light years from what you might find in Europe. Civilizations disappear , and the occidental civilization will disappear like the egyptians , the etrusques , the greeks , the romans , the ancient chinese , the maya ....However , Europe will
disappear before the US. Hence my feeling that in the very long term ( and in-between the Euro might appreciate itself up to 2$ ) , the US $ is a safer fiat currency than the euro.----------

Well, technology isn't always what makes the world go round. Especially if it's true benefits are being consumed by the debt created from currency inflation. If one looks at all the fantastic cost saving advances that Tech has brought the world over the last twenty years, where are the price
reductions? To the extent that the world has been on a dollar reserve system, that system has robbed it consumers of hugh price decreases that should have been available from all of these new production efficiencies. Indeed, this is where the massive dollar currency inflation is hidden. The
very fact that prices are flat (or rising at all) is a testimony to the inflation robbery present in the system. If all these advances were omitted, our price inflation would have been hyper in nature. Yet, to date, consumers are pacified by their phantom increased return on investments instead of the real savings a technology driven price reduction would have created. Yes, some costs are falling, but those are few and far between as they do little to negate the static cost of daily necessities that should have fallen much lower by now.

No, I believe the management of a nations money has more to do with maintaining it's prosperity than all the goods and production it's citizens can muster. I look forward to turning over the reigns of the reserve currency to a collection of diverse societies that, together will offer a more "world driven policy view" of how a money should act. The very fact that the ECB has not acted to artificially impact the Euro value is a credit to them. Even though they only hold gold as a reserve, soon, oil will back that currency in a way that will benefit them as much as it has the US dollar over all these years. I don't know about you, but I'll take black gold as backing any day.

Last night, somebody calling himself Skip posted a sad commentary of his experience in the gold market and issued a plaintiff call for reassurance from this Forum. Tonight, Canuck, in an act hardly anybody could fault him for, suddenly jumped up and made a run for the exits. The last time we were at these price levels (and after years of pie-in-the-sky forecasts) ANOTHER and FOA suddenly reversed themselves and announced that the POG was very likely to collapse. And now, just to be sure we are all scared as hell, Farfel shows up tonight to remind us that the world
economy is about to slip down a black hole, taking gold with it, of course. (Needless to say, I think such pronouncements are as looney as they are facile.) -------------
(to see the rest, read his post)


What do we conclude from the above post? Stranger, I appreciate your presenting your thoughts and perceptions. They validate my own perceptions of how westerners feel about gold. I also used to read Another's Thoughts, as an observer when they were presented by someone else. The one common thread in all of them was his council to buy only gold, physical gold. Yet, it never failed to impress me that every time those considerations were given, all discussion immediately turned to buying gold options, futures and mine stocks. It was like an automatic response that was ingrained in investor psychology from years of indoctrination. Your conclusions fit the same pattern.

Why is it that professional brokers and investment councilors in this country lead the public to this end? Is it because they have on depth of history to draw from or is it that they have "no fear" of losing others money? Mention that gold may rise and could become a bedrock for your life savings and not one paper pusher tells his clients to buy real gold. Yet, we let the facts speak for themselves. The gold price having fallen from manipulation has literally destroyed a large percentage of portfolios invested primarily in gold stocks. Some of these mine stocks have gone to zero and are in bankruptcy, never to return.

All the way down Another (and later myself from association) said to buy gold for the long haul because in the long term it may go very high. Then in typical like form, traders said buy gold stocks for the long term also. Don't listen to Another, it will never go that high and with these paper items you will get rich if it only goes up $100 bucks! Indeed, leverage ruled the day all the way down
with little regard to the fact that the "little guy" could lose it all with no hope to run for the final payoff . Now, here at $250 gold, Another presents a case for the destruction of the pricing market mechanism and still says, buy gold for the long haul. A concept, I might add that fundamentally offers the most bullish case for physical gold, while posing a worst case scenario for mine stocks.
Yet, intelligent thinkers and admitted white collar investment professionals, such as yourself, lay the
blame of of loses to mine stock investors at the doorstep of physical gold advocates.

The whole philosophical reasoning for buying physical gold was always to negate the possible total loses to ones assets from a breakdown of the worlds modern derivatives pricing system. A system that spans our entire financial structure, not just gold. Even with this risk in mind, I submit that it is still the current system advocates that present a "pie in the sky" council to new, unseasoned
savers. Just as you use Bill Gates and other "risk takers" to portray an "American Spirit" of "plunging in", it hides the hideous failure rate inherent such accomplishments. Had Skip not listened to the sirens song of great wealth, he would still have had a chance today to benefit from a
centuries old investment, real gold. So consider this, the next time you drum the march for the average persons savings to the tune of "paint your wagon and come along". For myself and many others, long term playback and asset safety are more important to our family than the bragging rights of day traders.

Sorry, FOA I didn't make the point to offend you. My intent was merely to share my confidence in the gold market at a time when people were obviously getting nervous.------

Sir Stranger,
no need to be sorry and your post did not offend me. I felt the offense was directed towards intelligent physical gold advocates. When you publicly interpret my posts as a reversal of thinking, you are wrong and send a false signal. To say that I expect the (physical) price of gold to
tumble, is a misleading statement that subordinates my reasoning by talking out of context.

I understand how our gold market presently trades as a paper derivative and in physical form. Every day, new evidence comes out to confirm this concept. TownC offered the excellent work of John Hathaway to further explain this evolution. When Another pointed out that the derivative side
could fail and be discounted in price from the effects of that failure, you obviously did not grasp it. Others did. If you had then you would have noted that I expect the physical gold price in the dealer community to explode as it's supply falls. A process of rejecting the current price setting methods.

--------As to your comments about white collar professionals and "westerners", I suppose you mean well. I would emphasize, however, that, out of respect for our host, I have specifically avoided discussing the merits of stocks vs. coins. I intend to keep it that way.-----

Again, I present a balanced observation that helps to account for the much larger percentage loses to investors that have followed the "established paper rout". Nervous people have a more pressing need to learn why their strategy has failed. Without balanced imput, we often repeat out
mistakes. I learn from my mistakes also.

As for merits of stocks vs. coins? There is no valid comparison. Apples and oranges have never had the same taste. The percentage of loss for one or the other is but a function of the risk one takes when placing savings into that vehicle. Coins will never be as risky as stocks of any kind. Nor will gold bullion in ones hand. The very simple laws of nature dictate that gold cannot fall to zero as
stocks have and often do.

-------Finally, as to who is misleading whom, all of our (your's and mine) posts are a matter of record. I hope I need say no more. ------

I believe we come to this forum to offer out Thoughts for everyone to view and discuss. No one is right, wrong or misleading as only events can and do prove all things. To date, cash invested in gold bullion has lost value much less than if it was placed in mine stocks. All of us can grasp that fact. Indeed, no more need be said.

FOA's lost post
http://www.larouchepub.com/lar_can_you_survive_2630.html
FOA and All:

I, for one, can testify that I did see FOA's post in which he spoke about the difficulty of using this "information-moving based medium of the internet" to communicate ideas, etc.

Unfortunately, I did not save it to disc, either, but as with all of his posts, it made a memorable subjective impression.

One concept that struck a resonant chord was his assertion that he is "but a medium for the transmission of ideas between two worlds"...and that as he tries to clarify that message he evolves inevitably into a "translator"...a role he never wanted to play.

As a classical musician, I am reminded of something heard long ago from my violin teacher. He spoke similarily about the recreative artist (musician) who should strive to be a perfect mirror in transmitting the composer's music to the listener. Personal involvement in that music on the part of the performer can easily get in the way of that process. Of course, the performer was always intended by the composer to be there, and to recreate the music in the moment of its performance. So it is no simple process from the beginning, this transmission of ideas from one person to another.

I, for one, have been fascinated by FOA's input and interpretation of the ideas of ANOTHER. It goes without saying that I would like to know who they are; but I do understand their desire to let their message speak for itself. In some ways a laudable goal, and in so many other ways, another hurdle in our quest for understanding.

I included the above link to Lyndon LaRouche's site offering an essay that refers to many of the themes of ANOTHER. Though admittedly not a main-stream figure (and thoroughly discreditted politically) he does offer thoughtful analysis, a professional economist's background, and more than a measure of corroboration of ANOTHER's scenario for me (who does not pretend to fully comprehend everything offered by FOA and ANOTHER on the first try.) Anyone who visits the link will see powerful assertions of the danger of derivetives, gold, world political situation, etc. A fascinating read for the open-minded!

Mr. Kosares,
All be well with you, my friend. The Greenspan is a large topic for this day. His long words pour from a troubled mind. That concern is great for all that can understand his reasons. The next move by this Federal Reserve will change the world, yes? We do not underestimate his problem and do feel his path to be locked in place. As it will be, I have little to say now, we wait for the next
response from mankind. However, this subject is of little reason for my words today.

I request the FOA say no more, as he considers his emotions. An explanation must be considered, even as his years are only somewhat less than mine. His defence of my Thoughts were the misplaced use of great energy and good spirit. However, I require no such army before me, for
my words stand in full view of all.
What of the many that find fault in my Thoughts? I say, attack and molest them as is needed to regain the calm mind. But, let it be known that without " the spoken reasons of logic" others view your sword thrusts as the "warrior that cuts only air"! We chose to ride this medium of discussion, and as such I must remain the "faceless one to all"! Such
as that may be, even the conduct of "well known" posters be at the risk. For all society requires a traveller to receive more than good wine for dinner. Even the guest of your house will see you as "faceless" and without form if he is sold only the "opinion" as rich conversation.

In addition, I stand before all people and laugh at their pronouncements of how important their words be. The creator made us as "fools" of the earth and we be "fools" to our death. To promote oneself as strong, wise and of need to others in this world, is to be seen as little more that the
beggar of recognition.

For all that concern themselves with "Another" the "thief of thoughts"! Be very fearful, my friends, for I have grown as such a "taker in the night". From the womb of my birth to the dust of the grave, I have stolen all my mind does know! My father did say, "breath in all that blows on the wind, for no man owns the storm". Indeed, I add, grasp every dust of knowledge from any breeze that parts your hair! Will this forum be a marketplace of "no cost" or do writers ask for payment of "notoriety" before others may read? I council all, pay noone this commission of "pride" for conversation most free. Force them to walk this lower path with citizens of every make of life. Indeed, I stand low before ones that say "I am new at this and know little", for from their very oratory spring the logic that moves this world into the next day. A world blinded with the perceived
power of control that exists only in minds of unfree men.

We speak again, in later time. I offer Mr. FOA's last item as condition of inducement for "free speech":

"let the knowledge pass through me as a river runs wild
yet don't claim the water for it's free as the nile"

We watch this new gold market together, yes? Thank You Another

Come what may?
ALL:
I do thank everyone that have voiced support for the continued sharing of my insights. Anyone of you that have been alive for a while must also understand the frustration of explaining a difficult topic. Truly, I (like all of you) am not a machine and the process of walking a fine line between two worlds of thought is a major energy drain. This unique forum gives all readers an opportunity to expand their viewpoints by observing the "real world of money" through different eyes. As such, I deplore any direction that takes us into the ego world of "traders calling the market". It is an accepted fact that many aspire to make that roll their life's work as there are plenty of other net
sites and forums to confirm it. As popular as this may be, it offers little in the way of gaining insights to the perspectives that drive world investments. As a group, the trading society often loses the concept that feelings and viewpoints are the driving forces that shape those little chart patterns so many follow. Because many give up in trying to decipher the meaning of these forces they degrade
themselves to a level of "follow the leader investing". True, it works sometimes, but one's spirit of understanding develops little from the process. As a result, when a major change does impact world thought, people are lost to grasp why the trend reversed, and more importantly, cannot change their strategy with it. Perhaps, something we have seen in the gold market these last many years? So, "let the world have it's way, come what may", I will try to present my insights as seen through others. I hope many will join us on this journey.

Further:

I completely understand (as do you) that many people become upset when someone attacks the validity and purpose of their favourite investment strategy. Indeed, if most of your savings are installed in said discussed vehicle, the urge to find a flaw in the reasoning becomes overwhelming. Often one does not have a factual explanation, but we do have the ability to "think out loud" in the form of a rambling discussion. Perhaps, this is how many view my posts? I offer that this form of "rebuttal" is preferable to just stating "he/she is faceless and doesn't have the facts"??? If I do this, I apologize and will try to change. I think Mr. "PH in LA" had it very right when he observed how some internet writers, "come wading in with both barrels blazing" as they present their thoughts! I add that this could be an offshoot of our modern society. Hope we can get past this, soon! Thanks PH.

Onward:

Most investors that have assets in this broad arena called the gold market, have also come to appreciate just how large an "impact area" gold has had. Not only through out history, but right up to today. The ongoing battle over the "gold concept" has won and lost fortunes, built and destroyed empires and in general has warped the human senses about what money and savings should be. This conflict continues today, even onto the pages of this forum. As the stress builds on our world financial system, the lines of thought concerning gold are becoming more clear. Let's examine some of what I perceive to be some of those lines.

Of course there are those that do not even consider gold as a viable contender on the world money / investment scene. The have lately been a major vocal class that have prospered in the realm of the current financial system. Myself nor anyone else should blame them, as they follow their reality in a world that presently benefits their ideals. I think few of them have given themselves a full study of how world currencies have come and gone through out the years. If they had, the fact that they "have lived in a period of little change" should hold for them that things can reverse
without notice. History is full of recounts that describe the rise and fall of entire social groups at the hands of a sudden rethinking of what has economic value and what doesn't. In any event, ingrain monetary ideals usually do not change during ones lifetime, so the past lessons may be worthless for some. As a result, a large mass of society must always return a great portion of their wealth into
the hands of some "historical event".

Also included in the "gold perspective" are the true "physical gold advocates". They have seen through history how the destruction of various "money systems" always leads to the destruction of the "economic system" built upon the fiat concept. The efficient money system present in those fiat times, help to create the need (and therefore increase the value) for many real assets. The ensuing breakdown of the money always destroys the "efficiency" factor that society used to up-value the assets. Usually, any enterprise built upon the current functioning money contract system is impacted as it cannot change quickly enough to the evolving money system. It's hard to grasp that even real assets like houses, land, equipment, vital necessities and even food, can lose value as their trading pipeline is disrupted because no medium exists to fairly create "market value"! We have seen, time and time again, that real gold can gain value against "everything" during true money destruction.
During these times, the human spirit need for using a familiar process is all consuming. The exchange of goods and services continues, with or without a valid medium of exchange to express it. Still, values become so conflicted and lost during this process that the marketplace reaches out for the most tradable of things that can act as a medium. In that need to replace "efficiency", lost with the medium value of paper money, it upvalues any store of value thing as the new "medium of exchange". Yes, within a large marketplace, the human need for trade gives any "efficiently" attribute more valuable than food.

This is why I smile when someone says, "how will anyone be able to know if the gold is real and what will they value it as"? I say, that the marketplace dynamic will ram this education home very quickly. The above question is asked by someone that accepts and uses paper dollars every day.
Yet, these dollars are paper (how do you know they are real? as often they are counterfeit) and hold value only because the marketplace is using them. During a money breakdown, you will observe trading in the marketplace and quickly come to accept anything, ANYTHING, that even could be gold. Believe it!

Finally, we also have the "in-between gold advocates" in the "gold perspective". Usually, their view of the market is such that it is an industry built within the confines of the present monetary system. They do not hold an extreme view about paper money, and believe that today is different and our currency will only fail "somewhat"! So far, in concept they have been right for many years. Yet, in investment practice, their "gold perspective strategy" is failing. I say this in contrast, in that by holding physical gold, the "physical in your hand money insurance factor" is never lost, even as the quoted gold price falls. Especially, in today's new market dynamics we require the question:

"does the paper security in your hand give you an absolute claim to physical gold, or does it more so give you a "right" to receive dollars that match the increased value of gold?"

This "in between gold perspective" strategy, calls for placing money in various forms of paper gold. All based on the convenient factor of holding paper that gains in price as the demand for gold increases during a controlled slow burn of the world money systems. These paper investments are
expected to all gain because their value is "derived" from the quoted price of gold on established major exchanged, London, Comex, etc. Weather you hold "gold certificates" , mining stocks, gold options or gold loans, an observer can readily correlate their increase and decrease in value to the world quoted gold price. They are derivatives by nature, because there very worth requires the observation of another price setting market.

It is here, in this "in-between market" that I believe most gold investors will first see the breakdown in the world money system. Yet, for them, this breakdown will bring the loss of performance to their paper holdings, because, from necessity, our financial structure cannot allow the established quoted price of gold to rise. To honour the present contracts, would require the supply of millions
upon millions of ounces of gold that simply does not exist. In as much as these players expect a huge payoff on their holdings as the gold market must run skyward to balance delivery, the opposite action will most likely be delivered. Because all of their holdings are valued upon a marketplace that establishes a price with even more derivative trading, the expected failure of those contracts will crush the quoted price. Just as most men will not hang themselves with a rope, the shorts that actually create the quoted price of gold today, will not trade it higher. In fact, I believe they are trying to gather physical gold (taking delivery everywhere) while it still trades in relation to the low derivatives price. Unless you are a major entity in world affairs, holding something the world must have, I
doubt any form of gold paper securities will escape the burn. Indeed, over time, in a up and down fashion, most of the paper gold holdings will be destroyed first, then the physical gold price will zoom in a matter of days if not hours!

How will mining shares respond to this "POSSIBLE" event?

As Europe Grows, France's Jobless Rate Falls to 6-Year Low

------The latest data underscore recent signs of stronger growth throughout Europe. France's main trading partners - Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy - are all undergoing economic revivals. Indeed, Italy and Spain reported separately Tuesday that factory prices jumped by a greater than expected 0.6 percent in July.--------

-------Based on the improvement in industrial output and continuing high consumer confidence, the government predicts that economic growth will accelerate next year to between 2.6 percent and 3 percent, up from estimated growth of 2.5 percent this year.-----


-----Although the latest economic data raised fears that the ECB might increase interest rates, inflation seems firmly under control in the EU. Consumer prices in the single currency zone rose at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent in July, well below the 2 percent limit for countries that have adopted the euro.-------

Peter,
Thanks for not only reading my post, but for understanding some of it. It's interesting how well we comprehend our own thinking, yet never really know if anyone else is following the same trend. That's why I'm happy to see others offering their viewpoints. It broadens the conversations and allows everyone, in their own way get something from of it. Right or wrong, at least we pick up the drift of all the many discussions that occur here.

Your comments about my #12506: I'll rearrange your words a little.

Does your (statement) describe the same phenomena and event as my #8841 of 7/13.

FOA said: ----Just as most men will not hang themselves with a rope, the shorts that actually create the quoted price of gold today, will not trade it higher. In fact, I believe they are trying to gather physical gold (taking delivery everywhere) while it still trades in relation to the low derivatives price.-----

Peter said: ------I believe they will continue this control of the POG with impunity, until their cohorts have completed the trading activities necessary to protect their positions. They do not have to buy physical gold to do this. As negative sentiment holds the price of gold down and leaves all rallies suspect, larger quantities of long future contracts can be purchased without pulling up the price of physical. The same leverage that created massive short positions will also serve to acquire the longs. It is the writer of those long contracts that is caught short by the breakout. The purchaser has locked in his cover price for a small fraction of the funds that would be necessary to buy the physical. Squaring off the short sales then becomes merely a technical financial matter. Provided, of course, that the 'System' is still in place.-------

Peter, I went back and read your post to better understand it's direction. First, let me further expand on the thought I presented.

The understanding I'm presenting here, is offered to explain why so many are off base and confused about the current gold price. Because I too am "Western" my thinking was also skewed towards a big short covering blow-out, where all "paper would burn". It seemed the only outcome, the markets would lock up and close down as the price of bullion went sky high. That was how Another offered the original thoughts, as he tried to get everyone to see how out of whack the real market was. What would have been required to set off such a run back then? Anyone large enough to buy spot physical gold as an "open order" on the world dealer market. Perhaps, several oil states working with several CBs could have offered, say, a 10 billion book priced above the
London fix. It would have been all over with, as anyone with short exposure would be shut down from margin calls as gold zoomed in price. That didn't happen, probably because the market was in the process of entraping itself with false perceptions. Most of the real gold was corrnered anyway,
so let the world have it's way!

As time has passed, our gold pricing has seemed to become more irrational. Other important analyst are starting to look for different explanations also. Today, Another is no longer "on the fringe of reality". However, there was always more to it than just politically manipulated markets.
The lower we go the more questions crop up. Why does gold still continue to drop in the face of statistics that show massive demand and ongoing supply deficits? Why does it hold here at $250 when this range will obviously destroy most supply from the mines? How in the world can it go even lower when everyone is buying it?

The answer lies in our perception of the modern gold markets. Back in the late 70s and early 80s, anyone "big" that wanted gold simply brought it "spot physical" in "allocated" form in London. The gold was there for delivery if wanted. Others brought through large world class dealers.
Further out on the limb, one could buy Comex "spot month" or "near by" and take delivery of a warehouse receipt later. When large orders went into the paper market, it had a major impact on the price because the price was tied to a "good probability" that real gold may be called for. Paper
buying, back then scared shorts because the longs that brought for hedging and investment purposes, really did take delivery quite often.

Time has gone by and things have changed. I won't get into the political why and what for because that's Another story. The gold market evolved as needs and perceptions changed. Through out the late 80s and early 90s the "need" to use gold as a "security" hedge expanded tremendously. Far more players entered the market to secure a "gold hedge" than physical off take statistics indicated. The physical side of the market was becoming less and less important as
players became satisfied to hold the promise to supply gold from someone else, instead of the actual bullion. Mine supply and scrap was becoming more a product for the jewellery trade and bullion coins. The market then evolved further as large gains from booming world security markets
pressed portfolio hedgers to commit less money for gold hedges. Even though the demand for paper gold was exploding, derivatives were allowing investors to tie up the same exposure with less cash. If they could go a little further out on the limb, away from "deliver ability probability", they could still hold gold using less working money. After all, the world was doing fine as even the worst of problems seemed to be handled by the IMF team. The real need for physical gold was always in the "total currency default / inflation" arena and that seemed light years away. So, over time, the gold market matured into it's present state. Today, by far, most of the holdings of gold are
represented in derivative form. Little more than a bet with someone else about where the price of gold is going. You put up cash, someone else puts up cash and both of you watch the exchange price indicate how you will settle up later. Settle up in cash, that is! The "good probability" of someone wanting delivery was fading away.

What is the problem with all of this, you ask? It's the trading of real bullion that still must set the price of all of these outstanding derivative bets, yes? Well, not really.

The end work of this process has found the 3,000 or 5,000 ton per year real bullion market, is little more that a sea shell on a fifty mile beach. Everyone on the "gold net" already knows how much LBMA trades and that is small stuff compared to the other unseen world markets. The debth
and liquidity of the paper market moved the bullion trade into the "pink sheets". Needless to say, today, the famed "closing bullion price" is set by the cash commitments that bid for derivatives, not the cash that bids for bullion. In the old days, really big traders would arbitrage any such paper overhang against bullion by calling for delivery. Today, with the paper market so large, any such power play would find most traders taking delivery of gold as the market is sold out from under him. Besides, this new market perspective works against any long traders because none of the present "derivative gold demand" wants delivery! They only want to settle in cash, because taking delivery would require selling their other "better performing" investments. The mindset today is that gold is only an insurance hedge, as such "an increase in it's price will settle up in a cash delivery to me, to offset my other risk of cash impairment to my portfolio"! To further develop: "I don't need
physical gold, I only need to participate in it's price movements"!

In complete satisfaction of the current trend, derivatives fill the bill for this current gold market. Clearly, we can see that this new market is not "fraudulent". There is nothing wrong with players pouring margin money into the short side to create a demanded product! It's has evolved into a cash game. This is where GATA is fighting a war they cannot win. Gold bugs (of the last few years) were viewing the present market using 70s eyes. Indeed, they were investing in an industry that was losing primary demand for it's product, even as "the need" for that product was exploding. This new gold market found a way to channel the "modern need" for gold's attributes away from physical demand and into paper supply. You simply can't create a short covering run if none of the current (insurance) longs want to take delivery. Even worse, as this trend was further developed, more and more old private physical holders were selling their gold and holding paper instead. Add to that Western dollar supporters wanting their currency to look good, and we have paper gold supply that's also used as a form of positive currency intervention. Anyone investing in the gold industry, expecting bullion to explode from all the new demand was truly disappointed. For every new Western gold bug that wanted gold for insurance, there were five paper sellers to supply him with all the gold insurance he needed, at a fraction of the cash commitment.

Peter, (if you are still with me) this is only the end of this act, not the end of the play. We have been standing on the trail and looking at where we have just travelled. Now, let's turn around and look forward.

Everything we just discussed was what "Western Gold Bug Eyes" didn't see! Most have read my other posts and have seen how Another has cleared the path without pointing the way. My above is a broad overview without describing the full political involvement. Just as everything is in
constant movement and change, so too is the gold market. The recent evolution in the world currency scene has set in motion a new sea change of events. The same dollar/IMF world that created the seemingly endless wealth for American investors is now entering the end of it's historical
timeline. The tremendous debt that purchased our lifestyle, is slowly being revalued world-wide. Every tick against the dollar currency is translated into more sales by foreign holders of that debt. Soon, the par value of that debt will begin to fade as the negative trade deficit of the US works it's evil ways. At the same time, for the first time sense the dollar overruled the Pound, another currency has been created that is equal to the task. The dynamic of changing world reserve currencies is also going to change the dynamic of the gold market. Once again, the needs of investors will redirect the method of using gold. As the wealth effect of the Dollar/IMF system goes into reverse, the process of receiving your gold hedge insurance in dollars will be perceived as a risk. At this stage, all of the past demand for gold that was channelled into cash settled paper
derivatives will suddenly reverse it's trend. Slowly, more and more of a percentage of settlement will be asked for in real gold. As delivery fails from increased demand, existing derivatives will be dumped upon the market place in an attempt to cash out. This very process will: First dry up all gold supply and lock down any existing private stocks. Second, cash biding on the dealer market will become convoluted and reflect only gold's currency value. It's economic / industrial use will be priced totally out of the market. Third, what was once the world price making market for gold, will become useless for delivery as it's contracts are defaulted on and discounted in price. What price could the world gold price be set at, using these defaulted, bond like securities? How low does russian debt trade?

Peter, using your analogy about how the traders may be buying gold paper long, could be correct for this moment in time. But, as you can see, if the above plays out, they will be in the same boat holding nothing but a ticket for court. I bet, most of the smart ones are slowly looking for available gold, not more derivatives. I believe that in fits and starts, all paper gold (any comex paper outside of spot month) will be sold down. Driving the perceived physical price lower until no more can be delivered. Then, a general default will begin, destroying the entire gold industry as we know it.

As in conclusion to my earlier post, I hope to later describe the trouble this will visit upon the mining industry.

Normal view from "this side of the river"
"I think the markets are starting the long awaited "final convulsion"!" FOA (9/1/99; 6:11:11MDT - Msg ID:12547)
These last months have been difficult for those who watch from this side of the river the slow-motion playing out of macro forces that seem so much clearer from over there on your side. It all appears so much more dramatic and dynamic from over there. From here, in a desperate attempt at perspective, I sometimes wonder how dramatic it all really is.

Hello PH,
The drama in any play is only as real as it's impact upon your perception. In real life, and in a similar view, economic events are only an "observation" unless they manifest themselves into a forced change of your life style.

For most people, the wealth they carry is the determining factor in how much they are "free to chose" their living conditions. Further, your freedom to move about in a social standard is governed by how others that network (trade) with you and the world in general value the form of wealth you choose to hold.

Your post is so very "on point", in that it defines how the last twenty years (+/-) have not seen the American Dream altered with some "Historical Event". Even though all the items you described were predicted to cause major problems, none of them destroyed the system. Lives were impacted somewhat and plans redirected, but, all in all our social order continued with the perception is that our wealth has grown a great deal. Yet, there in lies the residue that "1971 was a cataclysmic Historical event"! It did not affect our life style, so much, but it did change our "perception of how we value wealth ". The use and acceptance of a world reserve fiat currency has altered the concept of how much wealth we really own. Many Westerners and Americans feel rich and act out that perception by living life in an "unaltered way". It has worked this long because all of us and the rest of the world "carry our note" in the form of US debt denominated in dollars. As long as we "put on a convincing act" the play continues because others think we are "good for payment"!

In a sense, America is like a stock that has been traded up to par, say $100 a share. Yet, all of the companies capitol was borrowed from creditor banks and spent on a lavish lifestyle. The perception is that: "this stock called America, it's going higher as long as everyone keeps trading it". Yet, if the bankers call the loans, this dollar concept (the above stock) will prove to truly hold nothing more than "the American Dream"!

Here is where we have walked in the misconception that "everything is normal" and "nothing has changed, that much". The truth is that none of these past problems have washed onto our shores because our debt has purchased these years of a "normal lifestyle". Prior to the event of 1971, a
nations "lifestyle" was brought on a cash basis, using a neutral or positive trade balance. Today, practically all of our wealth and economic strength is an illusion hidden in the dollars debts. Without a competitor, the dollar was accepted without recourse. 1971 was a highjack on a world
wide basis. In like form, when a person is robbed of all of their reserves, human logic dictates that they will go to work for the thief (that now has the money) in a effort to stay alive. Needless to say, this working arrangement will change as soon as the victim has saved some money again.

The arrival of the Euro will precipitate our first "historic event" that does wash onto our shores. It will arrive as a failed dollar gold market, rising US interest rates, a falling stock market, spiking oil prices and inflation on a major scale.

Holdings of US debt, world-wide, are now reversing and that trend will only escalate. One has but to review the recent thoughts of "contraryinvestor.com,,,,,,,,,,The Dollar and the "New Era": Are the Rules Changing?

-------The linkage hinges directly on the stock market. Lower dollar equals lower demand equals potentially lower asset prices. If the declining dollar ultimately causes a lower stock market, consumption declines and lower U.S. economic growth results. A lower market and economy would depress tax inflows possibly causing the government to get into the "crowding out" borrowing act again. A lower dollar also creates the unintended consequence of importing
inflation. Another interest rate no-no. Do all of these linkages work perfectly and in a linear manner? Of course not, but one can see that the virtuous circle of dollar upside can quickly turn into a dollar whirlpool to the downside with reinforcing mechanisms that cut in a negative direction. A true and sustained change in the dollar and inflows of global capital to the U.S. would seriously
challenge the "new era" thesis. We're not completely there yet. Like any market, the conclusion for the topping process of the dollar is anyone's guess. We'll gamble that the process is at least officially underway.-----------

Also read: Mr.Richebacher

-----The dismal science will never be the same if Dr. Kurt Richebacher's dire predictions for the global economy should come to pass.

The former chief economist and managing partner at Germany's Dresdner Bank says a deflationary collapse lies ahead that will ravage the world's bourses and usher in a dark period of austerity and financial discipline.

Probably not one economist in fifty shares his views, at least not publicly. Richebacher, now living in France, says many of his American colleagues have been seduced into ignorance and complicity by Wall Street's billions as well as by their love affair with mathematical models that shun fundamental laws of economics. --------------

------* Derivatives can insure individual market participants against risk, but not system as a whole. Ultimately they have spurred higher risk-taking through leverage, exposing the global financial system to the prospect of devastating failure.

Richebacher, who counts former Fed chairman Paul Volcker among his close friends, says U.S. economists of the 1960s would more readily have recognized these problems and acted stridently to counteract them.

Public discussion was still influenced back then by staid economists who represented the banks and who knew their theory. The current crop, however, is "really a part of Wall Street's sales force to sell shares."

In contrast with European economists, their theoretical thinking is "not too deep," and in recent years has been completely eclipsed by mathematical models that fail miserably in reckoning with the crucial variable of human behavior.

The current level of thinking is "unbelievable," he says. "How can you simply overlook a negative savings rate and mountainous trade deficit" in saying the economy is healthy and robust?

"There is almost no one left in America to pose critical questions about economic fundamentals," he laments. "The only miracle about the American economy is the consumer's amazing propensity to borrow" -- a fact which Richebacher says has delayed a day of reckoning. -------------

And finally see: The Magic of Credit & Financial Engineering by David W. Tice

------ This, like most derivatives that have come to so dominate our financial system, works well during bull markets. We, however, see these derivatives much a ticking time bomb. One of these days, we will have a bear market and First Security Capital and other writers of derivative
insurance protection will be forced to sell securities to hedge their exposure. And if enough buyers do not come forward willing to part with their cash in the midst of a sinking market to take the other side of these trades, markets will suffer a liquidity crisis. And we, unfortunately, see no way around such an occurrence as our over-zealous financial system has created truly unfathomable
"perceived wealth" throughout our economy that is supported mainly by overvalued securities and unprecedented credit excesses.----------------

PH, your last item: ------ Maybe that's what the "final convulsion" will be. Just another "normal" convulsion. Over here! From this side of the river!--------

Thank you for devoting so much writing time to your response. I understood all of it quite clearly. I realize that the operational words are "Cash settlement."

Peter, we talk again! Your comment:

-----One question, regarding your *** I believe that in fits and starts, all paper gold (any comex paper outside of spot month) will be sold down. Driving the perceived physical price lower until no more can be delivered. *** That event would show up as "backwardation" which is regarded as an extremely bullish factor. Would that not trigger a definitive reversal, giving birth to a runaway upward movement in the spot market?--------

You are right, if we use our past gold trading history as a guide. The problem is that there have been only a few full cycles in the gold market. And, just as I offered before, the market has "evolved" after each go around. It's not the same animal most gold bugs started out with. Using the past "probable reactions" of traders to what were bullish signs on established markets then, could send one into trouble today. Look at how many positions were established these past few years, only to see traders reverse and pull out over and over again.

I think, the first time that Comex can't deliver, all future months will be called into question. Most likely, the officials will "Bunker Hunt" the exchange long before anyone knows what's happening. Let's face it, no one has ever seen Comex react when there were almost 500,000 OI contracts on
their option side? Not to mention a world full of derivative contracts looking for relief!

Your call my friend! I'll be watching if you (or anyone else here) want's to try and ride it. I agree with Leigh's take on this (hello and thank you Leigh) , " stay with physical"! It will pay off more than you could spend anyway!

------One thought I am still wondering about, was my conjecture that the apparent motives of Gold carry profits, politically driven debt bubble controls, Central Bank cash needs and collusion driven short sale profits, while all true, could be lesser activities behind a plan to corner most above ground gold and to acquire the ownership of many of the mines.-------

I'm not going to head into the political issue until finished building the basic mechanics of this. It's too confusing not to have a springboard of thought to jump from. I need that background so as to dodge the bullets. I'm smiling as I write this because some out there put an extra shell in their gun every time I write this analysis of Another. Crossroads #12665 wrote a good piece about how we

In the end it still aggravates them enough that they study it hard to find every flaw to throw back at you!

Gold Mines!
When I read this letter from I.V. Holtzman (USAGOLD (09/03/99; 15:13:20MDT - Msg ID:12765)I really had to lean back and smile. That was good, very good. I looked up from the computer screen and gazed easily out the window. Out there, across the ocean, someone sailed the seas with very deep thoughts. Perhaps, what he once saw on the horizon as a mirage was now becoming a little more real.

Earlier I posted an introduction and chapter one (Msg ID:8633) of "Gold: Saving Real Money In A Time Of Transition". It concluded with: "In chapter ((2)) we will build upon the workings of the gold market as it represents oil, the most strategic world commodity.". In that framework, Another is editing each chapter. In as much as I would like to quickly proceed, the question of "Gold Mines" is becoming more urgent. Another sees no need to go into this as his world holds little purpose in these investments. Yet, in my world, "the Western view" these securities are widely held in place of gold. Perhaps it is time to "Stand the ground and do battle upon the enemy before it devours our private wealth."

From Holtzman....
Tomcat said in (9/2/99; 11:22:58MDT - Msg ID:12671) that "the problem with using backwardation as a signal is that the spot POG is determined from paper gold transactions (thanks for this reminder, FOA)."

Holtzman here,

The measure you seek is not Spot, but Street.

You've correctly said that Spot is a creature of the Derivative world. It's the Paper price of a gold futures contract to be settled during the present month, and almost always to be settled for cash rather than for delivery.

As a result, it's no surprise that Spot POG is a better indicator of the Paper market since it is itself determined by constant repetitions of FOA's analogy of the two neighbours betting over the fence. Perhaps one in a thousand participants in the daily setting of Spot POG plans to buy physical gold or sell it. The other 999 participants are merely there to bet on it and claim their winnings in some other currency.

Put another way, how many people at a racetrack are attempting to buy a horse? If you want to know the going price of a physical horse, don't waste your attention on a racetrack.

If you want to know the going price of physical gold, don't waste your attention on the paper chase. And it's pretty obvious where we should look to find the going price of physical gold... I mean, after all, our very conversations here are being hosted by someone who spends his waking hours discovering that price.

The cash or Street price of gold is the number of dollars (or pounds, or euros) you take out of your wallet and hand to your friendly, neighbourhood coin dealer in return for a one-ounce Krugerrand.

Why a Krugerrand? Because it's the least numismatic, most commonly encountered, least lovely form of gold. It has no numismatic premium and no jewellery premium and no patriotic premium. It's even less attractive than a one-ounce 9999 ingot from JM or Credit Suisse.

That makes the Krugerrand the perfect unit of measure for Street POG. Its only special quality is that it contains exactly one ounce of gold (mixed with way too much copper).

The only thing which would disqualify the Krugerrand would be if suddenly coin dealers were willing to sell Maple Leaves or Eagles for less than Krugerrands. But to deal with that case, interpret Street POG as the price of the cheapest one-ounce coin available for sale at that moment.

The backwardation signal you seek will be when you see Quantity 100 Krugerrands selling on the street for significantly more dollars apiece than the Spot POG quoted by the paper markets that day.

A Krugerrand will always have a little premium built into its price (hi, I just bought these coins and I'd like to sell them to you without making any profit at all on the sale... my, that would be daft).

As things now stand, a month ago when Spot POG was quoted at $260, I bought a single Krugerrand for $268. That's within the range of normality. We're not in backwardation yet.

Let's say that Spot POG drops to $200 (easy, stomach, don't turn over now). What will a Krugerrand cost on the street then? If Spot POG drops no more abruptly than has been its wont in recent months, there's a decent chance Michael and his fellow coin dealers might then be able to profitably sell Krugerrands for $205 each. In that case, we're still not in backwardation and the shorts are still in control.

But if you see Spot POG drop to $200 while a Krugerrand selling on the street never falls below, say, $230-$240, hello new gold market. That's backwardation.

I think maybe the hardest mental hurdle for people to clear in understanding Another and FOA is this notion of two gold markets occurring simultaneously. There's an historical example (and it's Western :-) in which very much the same thing transpired...

In 1864, the USA and the CSA were reaching something of a stalemate in their war. Contrary to what most Americans learn today in (the winner's) school system, had but a very few decisions been made differently, the Confederacy would have won.

This, by the way, is why we see so many Americans (descended from both sides) re-enact Civil War battles over and over. How often (except on Monty Python) have you seen re-enactments of Pearl Harbour? The only battles worth replaying are the ones that could have gone either way.

In any event, to the average person living in Either the USA or CSA in 1864, the near term future was incredibly unclear and terrifying.

In the pre-war USA, national government funding was handled by the levying of import/export duties. The IRS was not yet a glimmer in politicians' eyes. For a nation at peace, duties provided sufficient income to run a minimalist national government.

In time of war, however, expenses magnify dramatically. Both the remnant USA and the new CSA needed to acquire vast funding very rapidly to raise an effective military. The both of them did so in the time honoured way: they borrowed the money. Have a peek at Lincoln greenbacks and Confederate paper money sometime. They are promises to pay the bearer with gold and/or silver at some significant time following the cessation of hostilities.

These documents were by no means the equivalent of today's Federal Reserve Notes (try redeeming a $20 FRN for a St. Gaudens sometime). No, Civil War paper banknotes were the equivalent of today's Gold Futures Contracts.

Oh, Lincoln greenbacks and Confederate dollars passed from wallet to wallet during the Civil War years as if they were currency, and in the first year or so they were regarded as 1-for-1 equivalents of coin. But as 1864 drew nearer, something odd began to happen.

"Howdy, I'd like to hand you this crisp $1 greenback in return for ten silver dimes change."

"I'll give you 8 dimes for a paper dollar, not a penny more."

Realise this happened in the North, in the remnant USA. It happened too in the Confederacy, but modern people remember it there only in association with the final default on paper which happened when the CSA government was extinguished.

But the sole difference between a Confederate dollar and a Lincoln greenback was that one paper issuer was still in existence in 1866 and one was not. In 1864, no one could confidently say that either government would still be there a mere two years hence.

Notice that, in this regard, not much has changed since then. In 1933 for US citizens, then in 1971 for the rest of us, the USA government voided its obligation to pay gold for paper dollars.

If you hand me silver or gold, I won't care whether the symbols impressed on it are from a reliable government, an unreliable one, or a defunct one. But if you hand me paper, I'd better be firmly assured the issuer will live long enough to pay off this debt to me.

Another and FOA, by saying wise people should avoid paper and only hold physical, are indicating that they expect the LBMA and Comex Gold Contract documents will go the way of the Confederate Dollar (or maybe more appropriately the pre-1933 paper dollar).

At the very least, they're saying the risk is so substantial that one should not be standing too near the fault line should the quake come sooner than predicted.

What the both of them are describing is an official Paper Spot POG (and its kindred future months' POGs) which may well plummet to $200 or even, as Another allowed some time ago, perhaps $10. Realise, though, that Another is by no means predicting that Michael will be able to profitably sell Krugerrands at $10 each. Far from it. What Another and FOA are anticipating is a situation much like the paper money situation in both the USA and the CSA in 1864: how likely is it that the paper contract you're handing me today will be redeemable for any amount of gold by this time next year? Tell you what, I've got a spare ten bob I feel no desperate attachment to. I'll buy your one-ounce IOU just for kicks. If LBMA completely expires, I'm out only a small amount. If LBMA unaccountably fails to expire, I've struck it rich.
Meanwhile, those of us with less of a gambling inclination will sleep more soundly holding physical. After all, a silver or gold coin remains silver or gold even after its issuer expires.

The one point of Another's and FOA's that I still don't entirely follow, however, is their contention that all mining stocks will go down to zero along with the Derivatives market. Certainly, any mining company which ties its future earnings to the paper market has also tied its future stock price to that teetering mass (Barrick, for example). And certainly, a low tide drops all ships, so that even those mining companies which are not involved in the paper chase will still suffer in the stock markets.

However, I have some difficulty seeing All mining stocks world-wide being extinguished utterly. Maimed, perhaps, but no matter how much trading turmoil occurs there will still be well-identified veins of gold ore sitting below ground, just waiting for someone to consider them valuable again. Yes, some of them may become nationalised. Yes, others will end up being sold at fire-sale prices. But I can't break myself from the notion that, much like the airline industry, the strong will survive and absorb the weak.

I'd dearly love to hear from either Another or FOA their thoughts on why they feel that not a single mining stock will survive. Or have I misunderstood you?

Yours,
I.V. Holtzman

Gold Mines: Little more than paper derivatives of gold!
From Mr. Holtzman #12765:

------Put another way, how many people at a racetrack are attempting to buy a horse? If you want to know the going price of a physical horse, don't waste your attention on a racetrack.----------

Thanks Holtzman,
To develop this further: -------------If you ever want to "use" the fine qualities of a "physical horse", don't plan on gaining those qualities by owning a "horse farm"! True, the best avenue to gain exposure to the "profits" (and loses) in the "horse producing industry" would be from the ownership in shares of said farm. However, any viable industry, incorporated into today's fiat currency inspired markets, depends entirely upon those markets to channel profits and increased equity values back to stake holders.-------- Even if the financial markets function, is it valid to compare the real wealth of owning a horse with the increased value that comes from the business of
producing such an animal?

From horse stables to automobiles to gold mines, it's important to understand that the ownership of any industry is not the same as owning it's end product. ---------Every industry's established "worth" is not only "just a derivative" of the value of it's end product, but is also a "derivative" of the "efficiency" and "continuation" of the world financial system that creates the marketplace for that
product.---- Better said: Your ownership in a company may be real, but for others to value your ownership realistically, it requires a functioning efficient medium of exchange. The beginnings of the first waves of currency inflation allows that function to upprice real producing companies. However,
historically, the end breakdowns in fiat money systems along with the rules / laws of the land, have always destroyed the efficiency of any industry to provide a product, no matter how valuable that item may be. Gold mines, like any other service, must operate within the official money system until
that system is completely destroyed. That includes abiding by all laws and official declarations the governing society may bring forth.

Preserving wealth during such times provides that the more clear and clean the ownership, the more likely one may control those assets. Again, even if the financial markets function, is it valid to compare the real wealth of owning gold with the increased value that comes from the business of producing gold?

We walk the trail of common logic:

If you needed a new car, would you buy General Motors stock instead ? Of course not! Why? Because the average citizen has first hand practical experience in the use and need of their car. The notion of owning the industry as a proxy for the car is quickly discarded as ridiculous. Still, some analyst would have you believe that one should hold gold mines as a proxy for gold.

I believe this flawed investment logic has become the "default" norm of most "western investors". While everyone understands the attributes for owning a car, few today have practical experience in the use of real gold as a money asset in their personal lives. For that matter, the analysts that promote this "proxy concept" are in the same boat. Let's face it, none here have never had to view gold as the "only savings to survive as a representative of their wealth"! Nor have we used it as "money in trade" on a regular basis. So, how could you, your broker or anyone else refute the proxy concept?

Heard this pitch before? Perhaps in a different format?: ------" The price of light trucks are going sky high due to world debt problems. So put most of your money into Ford stock and as little as possible in real trucks. Then, because of the way their production is leveraged to the "physical product", their stock will rise 100 times over the price increase of the "truck product"! After that we can sell some of the stock and buy hundreds of the trucks for later use when the money goes bad and times get tough. It's a unique concept inherent only in the automobile industry that few average "physical truck buyers" can grasp or understand. I have clients that have made millions doing this the last time light trucks rose in price. Ford is the best of the bunch because it has all the reserves already "in place" to supply "physical trucks" to a needing world. As such we can presume that those reserves constitute a value that will never be lost during hard times. -------- Compelling? Isn't it?
Of course we could be talking about the gold industry also.

Yes, it's a financially viable concept. Gold stocks "should?" rise as their product soars in price and brings currency profits to their bottom line. Because it's happened before in other industries and has repeated this cycle recently, mines must go up in the next bull market in gold, right? Well, maybe not!

We can see the long road behind us:

Read #12471, 12542, 12660. In those we find my reference to "physical gold advocates", "fiat money advocates" and "investors somewhere in the middle". The "in the middle" thinker looks back and sees a gold market that has responded to a kind of business cycle. To them, from the early 70s
onward, gold moved up from typical supply and demand issues created by the ebb and flow of our inflationary fiat system. The next cycle should take gold up to $400, $700 or even perhaps $1,000. The dollar will remain the worlds premier currency and the US fed will again raise rates to cool
things off. We create yet another cycle. Gold stocks will again be the prime beneficiary as "sophisticated" money moves from the world equity and currency markets into the shelter of "reserves in the ground".

Now, I would like to point out that this gold cycle has only been around, in this present form sense the dollar began it's withdrawal from being a gold loan. That's not very long in this gold world, when one considers how far back it has been in use. For us to draw conclusions that this dollar / gold cycle is of a lasting, repeating nature is stretching precedent to the limit!

Understand this: For countless years, mines have sold their product at established world gold prices. They may sell where and to whom they want, but the price was always a function of government currency valuations. The free markets that direct gold into jewellery and such have never set it's price. Rather they have always functioned under the currency / money use as the value creator. One way or another, the government sanctioned established marketplaces of gold have
always been under control and in evolution as the world currency structures have changed.

During this time the establishment gold price has not always benefited mine profits. During the 50s and late 60s gold was largely unprofitable to mine. Yet, we find no evidence of mines selling gold outside the "official" marketplace price in an effort to circumvent it's perceived obvious low price? I submit that in the past and in the future, they will always subject themselves to the
"established official" gold price, come what may. Any breakdown in the present dollar financial system that results in the failure of the "official established" derivative gold price will find every mining concern selling their production into that market price regardless of profit. To bypass that channel, the mines would separate themselves from the fiat banking establishment that they depend on to function in this world. Even though the "street price" (thanks Mr. H.) of gold soars within the small dealer network, it will be viewed as somewhat "Black-market". Mine selling into that arena would invite laws with "immediate" and total retroactive taxation of those profits. Or worse,
production limits could be fixed upon all mines as a means to prevent the same gross profit margins. Perhaps in the same way as the Texas Railroad Comm. controlled all US oil profits. Further, such a breaking away from supporting the official gold market by withdrawing physical supply could bring on the total closure of what established gold markets that exist. To that extent, mines could find themselves selling all gold production to the official CBs for who knows what price.

Can't happen, illegal, you say? When it comes to gold, nations, governments and Central Bankers change the rules quite often. One has but to look into the laws of every nation to find that " emergency currency flow controls" always include gold! You see, it's never considered money or a reserve until a crisis strikes. Some examples of past illegal actions:

1797 Napoleonic Wars. Bank of England suspends gold payments.
1917 US prohibits gold exports.
1919 UK prohibits gold exports without official permission. UK now off Gold Standard
1919 US gold exports permitted again.
1925 UK Gold Standard Act Currency convertible but only in amounts of 400 oz. Export of gold permitted again
1931 September UK abandons Gold Standard.
1933 US convertibility suspended ($20.67/oz). Export, all transactions and holding of gold forbidden.
1934 US Presidential Proclamation makes dollar again convertible to gold ($35/oz)
1939 London gold market closed on outbreak of war.
1954 London gold market re-opens after World War 2
1968 London market closed at request of US government.
1968 London market re-opens 1 April and now fixing in US$ for first time.
1971 US$ convertibility to gold suspended.
1973 US proposes further devaluation to $42.22/fine oz.
1975 US abolishes restrictions on citizens buying, selling or owning gold (formerly needed Treasury licence).

The above may not seem like much now, but it wrecked havoc upon many investors. Of special note: Was the gold market was closed between 1939 till 1954?

Onward:

Over the last few years, we have seen how the gold market is failing to act out it's past precedent. Many investors write this off to government gold policies that must soon end. Be that as it may, the process continues without regard to "past gold cycle logic". I point out that the lack of new mine supply did not prevent the low real prices prevalent during much of the 50s and 60s. Will the shutting down of most world mines prevent a low "official gold price" today as many think? Not in the broad political scheme of things.

But what are they thinking as this process is worked?

Would a dealer "street price" in the thousands change things? Not if the only recourse is for private money to move into Euros! The crisis policy will be to maintain the official gold market with low priced mine supply and allow the physical dealer market to run with whatever private stocks that arrive. Remember, the present financial system has a need for new mined gold to flow into derivatives at a low price to support the paper market. The same paper market that keeps oil behind the dollar also holds the dollar together. As of today; To further pull existing "old gold" from portfolios by forcing the street price down now invites a run from the dollar. A high physical "street price" will at least keep the dollar in play when price inflation begins.
If the paper gold price rises from it's present level, will gold stocks follow? Probably! But what if that rise ends quickly as the gold market begins it's next "official" failure run?


We make camp and rest here:

Looking outward:

The next money breakdown will not be a typical inflation cycle. The dollar has reached the end of it's "currency inflation" logistics as it's local debt load now only expands as foreign dollar debt is devalued from par. Yes, there will be "super inflation", but it won't be part of a "perceived" next cycle that extends from the lows of the last go around.

The ECB view:

Because gold continues to be the respected "currency of nations" in each currency block, our physical gold must be withdrawn from honouring the long standing dollar based "derivatives gold market". In fits and starts, the entire gold industry as they know it will fall away as the dollar is destroyed through local US inflation. Because history has never witnessed the destruction of a fiat world reserve currency, many world industries and businesses that grew up within this US system will suffer as investors shift holdings. Any industry that finds it's value from a dollar derivative marketplace will be in disarray. Therefore, we must allow the Euro to float on it's own and thus guard the Eurozone from the shattering effects of this.

To conclude:
Consider how you hold your gold as "we watch this new gold market together.

Cmax, Hello and welcome again!
Thank you for sharing your present thoughts and very relevant earlier posts. Did you read Holtzman #12765? His excellent post was able to create a nice perception for physical gold, "street gold". A well written analogy that allows the average investor to grasp what I believe will be a new, much larger market for gold world-wide. It also generates a real understanding of how the "street price" would differ from all other established markets. He used the 1864 American civil war to demonstrate how two issues of paper money (as in comparison to paper gold?) were discounted in common circulation. It is a tremendous help to anyone that reads it.

In any event, I believe most of the lesser developed countries will be in the forefront of building a high "street price" for physical gold. Especially China! For them (some Chinese are very, very wealthy), price was never the real consideration, rather it was the enormous amounts they had to bring in well ahead of any supply disruptions. Hence their buying patterns over the last many years. Many very large buyers were moving gold through Hong Kong, before and after the take-over. I believe, far more gold has already entered that country than public figures show. It will not be available at any price when the storm hits. They already have the gold! Any move to announce an open bid, using dollar reserves would be after the fact. The oil producers are very well in the same situation. I think it was the poster "GFD" (hello GFD!) that noted China the other day. He also pointed out how "street gold" could shield many citizens outside the Western block from the extreme fracture that is coming. Y2K will be something to behold, but it will be a side-show when the modern gold market breaks!
Again, thanks for reading from Venezuela and write when able.

Does anyone remember FOA's June 14th prediction of a major shift in gold valuations? He said theU.S. would openly go along with this change. Well, it looks like this is it. My question, again, is how and why they are only revaluing 10 percent of their reserves.

Hello Leigh,
Let's look at what they propose and lay that upon the 1976 Jamaica Accords. With that background we can work out why the US dollar block is "now" moving in the gold direction.

WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund will revalue some of its gold to fund debt relief thereby avoiding open-market gold sales, a politically difficult proposition that spooked gold markets, documents posted on the Internet revealed on Tuesday.-----------

First, I want to say that the posting of those documents was no accident as some think. No one wanted to take credit for floating this in public, so an order was given to send it out the back door! This is a major shift in international currency dealings that will eventually impact the LBMA gold
market in a big way. The BOE gold sales to help out some favoured dealers is no longer looking like a bumbling operation. Because no more gold was coming out of Euroland and the USA cannot touch it's bullion, London had to be on track to cover some bases if the original IMF deal fell
through. But, you might say, they always had the Swiss sale to back them up if the IMF went sour? No possible way! The US knew that world liquidity was drying up and the dollar would have to be sacrificed with some move to gold revaluation if congress cut off the sale. Once that "gold currency" door was opened, the Swiss will never sell! Change is coming to the gold world and London had to already be online to the EMU before this hits the dollar. "Street Gold" and "Paper Gold" are going to part ways!

-----------The documents released on the Internet provided few details on the new plan but sources told Reuters the latest plan had already been approved by the Group of Seven nations. Under the plan, countries which owe the IMF money from past loans, such as Mexico, would buy IMF gold the day before loan payments are due and then repay the instalment the next day with the same gold, sources familiar with the scheme told Reuters.The plan raises cash for the IMF because the fund values the gold on its balance sheet at about $46
an ounce. Since gold is actually worth about $255 an ounce, the transaction would net the IMF profits of about $209 an ounce, or about $2.1 billion. After selling the gold, the fund would return $46 per ounce back to its General Resource Account and then transfer the $2.1 billion in profits to a trust fund. The trust would invest the $2.1 billion and
use the proceeds to fund both the HIPC debt relief nitiative and ESAF. The new plan will likely appease the gold industry and lawmakers from U.S. gold producing states since the IMF's gold would probably never leave its vaults. ---------

Leigh, this action is a direct violation of the Jamaica Accords:

2.C Managed floating system and the G-7 Council

-----------In January 1976, the IMF convened a monetary summit in Jamaica to reach some agreement on a new monetary system. The Jamaica Accords formally recognized the managed
floating system and allowed nations the choice of a foreign exchange regime as long as their actions did not prove disruptive to trade partners and the world economy. Gold was demonetized as a reserve asset. The Jamaica Accords were ratified in April 1978.-------------

For the first time sense 1978, gold is going to be recognized and utilized as an "international currency" "in the open" on a G-7 level! They are accepting the gold as a "MONEY" payment and will hold it as a real Monetary reserve to lend paper currency against. This is a HUGE reversal for the Dollar / IMF block and will work to the advantage of the ECB / BIS! If this action holds, the ECB has won the dollar roll for Europe thru default!
The point I made in my June posts (and prior) was that everyone was buying physical gold and "running like hell"! They were doing this because of the risk implications! If none of the non Euro major gold holders could sell gold to further support the paper gold market, it would fail and bring down the dollar. When England announced their gold sale, it was obvious that the political chances of new gold hitting the market had become almost zero. Now with GS locking up "street bullion" and selling future months like crazy, we can see where the split is going to occur. This could mark the turn!

All: I hope to reply to ORO, Michael and everyone, but must take care of several things.

IMF gold sale - a question to anyone.....
Foa's 13086 was another keeper. I love the tale unfolding and I can only pray this may be a way for us to find our collective way out of the dark times at hand. That being said, I can only wonder how the current IMF plan differs in function than an outright sale? I understand the accounting tricks-wink wink nod nod-but the disposition of the yellow stuff is still into a market of some sort, right? Will the IMF sell to the good 'ol boys or what? The gold is still absorbed into the market place. I don't get it.------

---Gandalf the White (09/08/99; 22:25:25MDT - Msg ID:13105)
Just a few comments! Thanks FOA for the view of the "floated" IMF change of policy thought. -- Years ago, when I was in the other Wash. (DC), it was common technique to float a rumor and see the response before implementing a new policy. No scream heard from either party or the sheeple, and BANG a new law or policy! -- The IMF had already said to the WGC that it could not do as the WGC had suggested, as it was against their own charter, BUT now after the webpage error -- do you hear anything ? --- We watch together, yes? --- BTW the Hobbits each have their "precious" !! ;-)------

Jinx44 and Gandalf,
This IMF change is a fresh revelation on the market and may take some time to sink in. My current understanding is that the G7 accepted it as an inevitable consequence! Yes, it was a "floated" idea, but changes of this magnitude are never "put out" for approval. Rather, it's an "announcement" of direction and "everyone make adjustments" as they see fit.

Jinx, the gold will be sold (to Mexico as an example) at $46 ounce. That $46 in real cash (paid from Mexico) will go fill the hole left in the IMF bullion account. It won't change the rest of the bullion holdings as they will still be valued at $46. The sold gold will then be accepted by the IMF as payment (again example, Mexico) on a loan at the new $255+/-. You should recognize this for what it does. Gold will for the first time in "a while" be taken as a cash payment for a G7 loan obligation. Prior to this the gold had to be sold for currency and the currency used in payment.

Further: This "new money gold" will go into a IMF new account as a real currency reserve (just like dollars and marks) and be used as collateral to lend currency against. Read that collateral word as being just like all the other currency reserves CBs now hold. The big "no no" about this is that from the Jamaica Accords until now, gold could only be held as a commodity to be sold or lent before it's liquidity was recognized!

Leigh; This action opens up the door to use all "unlent" gold resources as currency. It could set off a scramble to "unlend" all "lent" gold. Especially notable is the fact that, through this precedent, the CBs could sell gold reserves to anyone at $46 and receive it back as a currency at market price for loan payments. That is why it's so important for the IMF to hold the other 90% back in another
account! Need I tell you that this action uses "physical gold" "as is", no paper! If, and it's a big IF, this goes through it will be the death of the paper gold era. AND, it will open the door to get the "street price" as high as possible!!! If they don't back off from this, it will open a can of worms the size of the pacific ocean! We patiently watch! FOA

IMF Plans to Revalue Its Gold Reserves

Accounting Step Is Latest Effort to Finance Debt Relief for Poor Nations

By Paul Blustein Washington Post Service

(FOA note: see link for full story)

------According to Reuters, which translated from Dutch the document posted on the Web site of the Dutch Finance Ministry, the plan works as follows: A country that is not having trouble making its debt payments would buy gold from the IMF at the lower price the day before a loan payment is
due and then make its payment the next day with the same gold.

The IMF would then have gold it could value at about $209 an ounce more than the gold it started with, based on current market prices.

The IMF would set aside the ''profit'' in a special trust fund for poor-country debt relief, as well as another low-interest loan program for low-income nations. ---------

Hello ORO,

-----ORO (9/8/99; 10:46:57MDT - Msg ID:13043)
MK, is the IMF a little bit pregnant?
The repricing scheme for 10% of the gold in their vault is not going to make sense to anyone but those who value the gold at the 35 SDR $42 level, who would be the lenders. The result is the use of gold as reserve currency by the IMF. This is a micrometer move towards a gold standard
defacto. ----------

ORO: This was the corner that the ECB was hoping to squeeze the US into. Because the modern gold market was built upon the concept of using "proxy paper" for gold, it was vulnerable to any return to using gold itself as a currency asset. The use of actual bullion as a money asset, negates the use of gold IOUs in the fractional reserve function they now occupy. The trend changes as investors
want to use the "street gold" itself for the payment of debts. The advantage of this becomes evident as this "new acceptable currency" is seen as appreciating against other currencies.

The problem is manifest in every entity that made a market or used "IOU gold" in their dealings. It's much the same way that modern banks fold if all their customers start using cash and depositing it into their safety deposit boxes. Because we are most familiar with a currency fractional reserve, it's obvious that the treasury just prints cash until everyone is satisfied and price inflation has it's way. But, with a return to bullion, the BB have to eat their paper in a general default as all of the
physical gold is diverted for other uses.

The US started this when they nailed gold as only a physical commodity. Now with the IMF in a bind to save the dollar reserve system, they are forced to use gold as a very physical asset and in the process return it back into a medium of exchange currency context! The very dynamics that
destroys the need for a IOU gold market. They ran so fast, they caught themselves!

--------------The building of the gold short position is a necessary step towards a gold standard as well. Greenspan's old competitive gold bond vs. $ bond concept has essentially been adopted by the bullion departments of the banking industry, and their bonds have been found lacking (ref. lease rates going from 0.9% to 3.7%-4.5% is quite a blow for a bond holder). So is what we have a failing gold standard stunted in its infancy by fiat level leverage? -----------

I think this whole market started as a way of absorbing all the demand for gold by diverting it into a paper product. It also allowed important (oil) buyers an avenue to channel surplus cash into gold without driving the price. The more purpose the product served, the more it was accepted. The Dollar / IMF faction brought into it early on because in addition, it drove the dollar price of gold down, thereby making it (dollars) look better. Perhaps it is a kind of "oddball" gold standard! Whatever the case, it became massive enough to make it a threat to the dollar system. A major breakdown in the LBMA gold market, in conjunction with a spiking "street price" will push the
IMF rescue operations and the dollar over the cliff. This is where I see a run into the Euro by default. This brings me to your next item:

------The modern banker would not expect a currency without forced demand to survive and rise in value. The success of the dollar since Volcker has much to do with the $ debt of the resource rich emerging nations (a.k.a. colonies), has much to do with the rise of their $ debt and their need
to trade their resources for dollars to repay it. Hence creating the conditions for prolonged demand due to debt is the prerequisite for a return to a gold standard. Of course, one does not want the gold banking system to keel over before a gold standard starts in earnest, proving to the bankers that it is not desirable.-------

I think the new "gold standard" of the future will evolve from the collapse of the present paper one. They will never revert back to a "gold exchange" operation again. Rather a free trading physical market (again "street gold") most likely based in Euroland. It will give the governments the freedom to run their currencies as wanted and gold will seek it's own level. None of this will extract the old "paper gold" system from a protracted "workout". Look for the Mines, Bullion Banks and CBs to be at it for many years.

I saw your post about putting some numbers and times on this so people can understand it better. Another always had a definite "workout" period for this, but he never wanted readers to trade that knowledge. Too many variables that would entrap most "family savers". Besides, just buying gold and holding during this end time was plenty. Never the less, I'll try to put something together.

FOCUS-IMF plans to renounce further gold sales

WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) -

----------The document said many of the fund's directors believed "that a public statement should effectively limit the amount of gold that the fund would use for this purpose and would renounce any further gold sales for a given period of time in the future." --------

ALL: Once all the members get a taste of how painless this process is, the above "" for a given period of time in the future"" will be qiickly adjusted. Besides, who are they really addressing with this statement? None of the world gold advocates would have ever objected to using gold in this fashion! No, this "public statement" is aimed directly at dollar reserve holders! Don't want to start a land slide, do we?

--------"Since these transactions would take place between the fund and a member at a market-related price, they could not be regarded as having been undertaken with the
objective of managing the price of gold in the gold market, which would be contrary to (the fund's rules,)" the document said. -------------

ALL: Here they are trying to balance the old Jamaica Accords, just a bit. Also, when this happened before (see below), it wasn't the same process. Don't have the facts right here, but I know it was different. Hope we can find a record of it.

-------The fund noted that a precedent was set in 1992 when it accepted from Cambodia a payment in gold, which it had sold in restitution to Cambodia at a market-related price in partial payment of Cambodia's overdue obligations to the fund. ----------

Give this some time to sink in! It's a major concession that demonstrated just how much world liquidity is falling. The ECB and the BIS handed them this rope and then pointed to a near by tree.
What a mess??

TownCrier and all:
I have to laugh as they (IMF) keep revising their plan. I can just picture someone faxing out the "last" revision and another official running in saying "no, no, no, no, that won't work. we have to reword it"!

No matter how they cut it, the G7 has given the ok to revalue gold to market. That is where the extra equity will come from to give debt relief. Weather they sell it at par $46+/- or sell it at $300 or buy and sell it ten times, when it comes back to them it will carry more value than when it left. All the jawboning is a smokescreen to get around their articles. Otherwise, they would just revalue all their gold and work from there.

Because none of the rich member countries want to fund the IMF any higher, the precedent of re-valuing gold to market will used much more often. That, in turn will create a changed atmosphere in the gold world as the use of it's hidden equity will be impossible to ignore. If this action is pushed through it will legitimize "physical gold" as a valid currency for the payment of debts
Let's wait for them to issue a few dozen more explanations. Then have another look.
I'll be back later.

Dear FOA, thanks for you post #12765. I was reading it with great interest and then hit a set of walls that stopped me cold. If you would allow, I would like to ask a few questions.
You said:
--------"Would a dealer "street price" in the thousands change things? Not if the only recourse is for private money to move into Euros!"----------

Tom, this statement is an observation of an evolving dynamic. The years have gone by and it's late 1999, today, not yesterday. When gold does break to the upside, it's going there without most of the "Western gold paper market". The Mines, CBs, Bullion Banks, and Exchanges will all be
mired down, working out a failed IOU gold market. It almost has to! Listen to what most of the respected industry analyst are now observing: "a huge short squeeze is coming that will break these evil shorts". It's absolutely true, but the real physical world we live in will deliver an entirely different scenario than what most expect. Tom, just as ten people can't physically possess the same ounce of
gold, nine of them are going to court to make the others perform what physics will not allow!

We will not see a simple resolution (over six months to a year) of an accumulation of paper gold that has taken a decade to build. The result will be a completely failed and untraceable "IOU gold market" groping around as the "street gold" dealer market goes completely through the roof.

This will be happening during nothing short of total "trade warfare". Politically, no one over here is going to shut down "street gold trading" because it would invite people to move into Euros as a safe haven. You have read my other posts and understand the logic behind this position. Consider the "very clear observations of CMAX #13186". Here is someone that understands the dynamics of foreign assets and money during uncertain times. He states: " In all cases, when rigid or "virtual" exchange controls are applied to ANY money, the "street price" always runs the official price out
of the market.". Without the blow off valve of an "official black-market", everyone runs before the act! Without physical dealers like USAGOLD, dollars would more quickly leave the country for the next best world money, Euros. Currently the same thing happens with dollars in other failing countries.

-------"To further pull existing "old gold" from portfolios by forcing the street price down now invites a run from the dollar. A high physical "street price" will at least keep the dollar in play when price inflation begins."--------

Almost the same answer for that one. Except the reference to the fact that for the past many years, old gold, in private portfolios has been in the process of being sold as the owners brought paper gold. The remaining old gold stocks would be traded for Euros if the Street price is frozen Mr.
CMAX also considers the old gold question.

----I don't see how a low "street price" could cause a run on the dollar. In fact, I thought a low paper or street price for gold would help prevent a depreciation of the dollar.----

Again, don't hold still, time is running past you. The IMF story is part of this transition I wrote of earlier this year. The IMF / Dollar block is out of time. Europe has blocked the "low gold" deal of the past and it only continues from inertia. The US is caught in a quandary as they need the price of gold to rise NOW so as to find liquidity for it's foreign reserve debts. However, if the traditional paper gold exchanges allow gold to rise they will implode themselves. Hence, the US is abandoning
the LBMA and England for a high physical gold price. Read that: "street gold" like the kind in the IMF vaults!

---And finally, a question about your last two words. What is an '"official"failure run'?----

Slang for, official paper gold price is going much lower!

Tom, just read this and watch the world turn. Another would say, "time will prove all things"

Thanks, FOA

SecTreas Summers said, "The IMF has laid out an approach that will make it possible to mobilize the IMF gold reserves without gold sales."
Now wait a minute...isn't he being a bit wreckless in his use of the word "mobilize"? The IMF won't be mobilizing gold, but instead will be recognizing and relying upon it as a previously under-utilized asset.


TownCrier,
If your closing market reports get any better, CNBC will start getting nervous!

Also, Summers said: \`\`I believe that is a constructive approach,'' he said of using the gold revaluation to fund debt relief. "

I'll bet he was saying debt relief and thinking "dollar relief"????

ORO, Some things I know.

This work started back in 1988, not long after the 87 crash. Important people were asking some very serious questions about the timeline of the world monetary system. They expected a longterm evolving report that would expand ongoing events into a format of true life context. A
context to be understood at all levels of economic exposure. In other words, it had to do a better job of explaining the (then) recent illogical swings of world economic affairs and the effects of those swings on various national economic groups. Were we progressing into a new, better age, or was
our system responding in a death like downtrend?

Because the questions grew from a fear that the world economy would indeed contract in the future, leaders wanted to know how one could retain the most wealth during such an event. It was thought that if the basic extended family blocks of a nation could survive such a collapse, savings
intact, those nations and their children would be a benefit to economic affairs of the future. In effect, negate a possible return to the Dark Ages of European history. Our time frame was outward some 20+ years. I cannot offer the full report or it's complete ongoing analysis. But, the effort you have seen to date is one of sharing somewhat for the common good of all.

In a search for reasoning, they looked first, not only at the most broad perspectives, but ones that had the effects of history for confirmation. Often the record of historical human reactions are the only precedent that can refute the use of modern day financial theory. Especially if that Theory is in a "practice for proof" stage that might last for a generation or more.

1. They found one absolute repeating event that shaped the lives of countless individuals. It's effects upon the destiny and life directions of recent society had no equal. That one most striking and frightening observations was of the failure of paper money. With irony, we stood here in the
middle of 1988, a time of advanced thinking using higher education for guidance and could easily document that no paper money ever put into use had ever survived. Weather backed by precious metals or in stand alone form, not one lasted! Yet, we were hip deep in an entire economic world
that based and denominated it's wealth upon the further extensions of "fiat paper money".

2. The second major observation was in the evolution of what debt is. From the very beginning of time humans have borrowed and owed, from and to each other. During most of history, the period of time between a debt owed and a debt paid was looked upon as "a period of risk". The accepted longline historical concept was that the item borrowed may not be returned to the owner. In addition to this view it was ingrained that the primary real loss came from not being able to replace the "item" lent, not the secondary loss of not receiving the medium of exchange. Yet in today's world (1999), the "thing" that is usually at risk in a debt is the currency. Modern common perception stands that no one should have to accept these loses. In concept, governments nurture
these perceptions only because they "can" replace the currency with ease. Yet the actual physical structure of the debt (the economic good that the loan was based upon) is never regained. This engine alone is a major force in the destruction of currency systems. It's effect is to shrink the platform that creates real wealth and expands the financial instruments who's value depends upon that platforms continued function. Indeed, it is a complete conflict to historical, natural human interactions.

From these two grand perspectives we view the unstable trend lines of our modern economic structure. It is from this present structure, that many entities, both large and small now attempt to retreat. But, in order to transport wealth with assets intact, they had to understand these money dynamics as an ongoing breakdown of our economic system. A breakdown that ebbs and flows with a political posturing that makes this journey very uncomfortable without a stable, longterm grasp of the process. As the river Nile floods and withdraws in it's endless rush for the sea so to
will the energies of paper currencies be eventually absorbed into the ocean of history.

Onward:
Michael Kosares of USAGOLD knows well the very early coins of gold. Money coins that by their very existence today prove victory over the past creations of mankind's fraudulent commerce. The value of these coins now reflect an even higher value as art. Another minor means of wealth
transportation that has historically outperformed money gold.

But, in distant times past these same coins performed a far more noble roll. They remained the only existing money stock after "major economic societies failed". This particular function of gold is not important for 99% of time that economies function. One small evidence of this is present in the old Gold standard. With ragged inefficiency, paper currency circulated as gold deposit receipts along with gold coins during the course of normal financial dealings. However, after we endure that once in a "several centuries failure", the gold money stock becomes the vital building block of the next generation. History has shown that during that brief time, the owners of every ounce of gold provide the only efficient medium of exchange that rebuilds the marketplace. In transition, these latter day gold owners never rule the financial world. Rather they perform the act of energizing a dead economy by transporting buying power into the next expansion. The history of past human interaction was never one of hoarding money so much, as it was that of trading to gain life's things.
Life goes on.

Viewpoint:
It was pointed out that one need not invest in gold to negate the effects of an inflation. All we have to do is buy real things that increase in currency value faster than the loss of buying power. True, in that light gold is but one of many things that should keep us at least even. However, we are in the process of experiencing a "breakdown" or at the very least a major change in the entire financial system. Not just an ongoing inflation during a phase of a longline expansion. Our goal for certain individuals, is to show this dynamic at work as the real life events unfold and document it's progress. For private individuals that read these pages, historical purpose and present day logic will build further support for the holding of physical gold as these events reveal the true season. In this light I offer Anothers direction given some many years ago, "in this special season, let others buy things to hedge their present worth, let us buy gold in support of our future generations".

Onward:
After reading ORO (9/8/99; 8:24:51MDT - Msg ID:13029), I wanted to at least be more direct in offering this ongoing discussion of events. You do a wonderful job of writing and I often find my information is just a reword what is said:

---- "In order to gain action from people, one needs to provide a timetable for the events (within my nephew's lifetime, mine, my parents' or my grandparents', or before the year turns, any time now...). This is the kind of support that I myself required before I was willing to accept the need for putting resources into "gilded insurance". The same need for support with numbers and charts that I am working on filling is needed to induce the financial pros to give their clients direction. The issue
is a patriotic one. Small business America will not survive without small capital hoards. The same problem they had in the depression. The reason for the length of the depression, was the confiscation of gold. The inability of small businesses to find capital pools in an atmosphere of credit
unwinding, and the simple death of the money supply in lew of the indestructible gold that was confiscated was the cause for an extra decade of suffering. The only way I see to avoid it is to convince people to build these pools now or end up working for a foreigner for the rest of their
lives, since only foreign pools of gold capital will be available (India, perhaps Europe, Arab countries, Asians from countries that managed to pick up the pieces most quickly)."--------

ORO, on these points I completely agree. However, all that is left to drive the last remnants of this world engine is the "American Dream". The leverage to attain that "Dream" is presently stretched so far that any withdrawal back into reality will implode the dollar with amazing speed. The time may be already past for any large scale building of gold stocks based upon reality. But,
still the effort is not lost.

Also:

---- "The key to the numbers is that set of numbers that quantifies the issues. Particularly important is the understanding of how the international dollar system works, how leveraged it is, how that makes it susceptible even to small shocks, how a dollar collapse in international markets would play out in the US. Once the arguments and the numbers are shown and it is possible to convince a professional of the dangers facing the dollar both as reserve currency and the currency of the US, only then is it possible to make the argument for gold as anything other than another paper airplane to ride in the markets. Perhaps you will start a presentation of the qualitative issues regarding the
dollar (rather than gold), interspersed with the data you may want to quote. I am currently working on the data to show the details of the situation."-------------

Onward:
The best indicator one could find to advance the warning of a reserve currency breakdown is the fall away of price inflation after decades of local currency and debt expansion. To observe the history of paper money is to view it's constant loss of value as expressed in the price of daily things. Weather backed by gold or nothing but "a dream", no world economic power has ever let it's currency increase in value for the long term.

The only way any currency can, in the short haul become price inflation neutral is through the demise of it's competing moneys. This effect is seen as an increase in the holdings of one major currency and the corresponding sale (increase in trading velocity) of the displaced foreign money. In the case of the modern world reserve currency, the dollar, we look to the net increase of foreign holdings of US treasury debt. The proxy for holding US cash.

(Note: A table of this recently appeared on the Investech web site. I cannot reproduce it. Perhaps someone else can.)
From 1979 through 1994, the increase was always positive, but never in fully manageable amounts. From 1995 till mid 1998, the accumulation exploded off the chart as money competitors became the spending currency and the dollar the holding currency. It's well documented how this
effect has kept price inflation in terms of the local US markets from rising. However, this long trend also had the effects of denominating almost all world debt in dollar terms. This was seen through out the 90s and is considered the end time event that will break the dollar. Because the local American economic structure has always been finite, it cannot defend it's currency with the exchange of real goods nor represent the value of the debts of the entire world. The downside, not discussed result of this will be the complete destruction of the dollar as a reserve currency. This begins as an attempt is made to reverse the dollar holding process. The same chart above also presents a massive decline in net foreign US debt purchases beginning in 1999+/-. The trigger of this action was the successful establishment of a larger competing reserve currency, the Euro.

Because a world reserve fiat currency can only represent the tradable value of it's local economic structure, the world markets will now devalue most all debt based upon the dollar. This effort will begin a real "catch up" phase on the US price inflation front, even as dollar debt is burned
with a vengeance world-wide. This loss of the dollar vehicle will also bring the destruction of many contemporary derivative markets that priced commodities for their value as trading items, rather than their traditional good use.

Leigh, I think that every economic block lives out it's own timeline. These things have occurred through out the human existence. Even when gold was in use as money, I might add. Who is to say that Europe will not be in the same situation 50 years from now? Each generation has to find it's place in the life cycle of currency events. Ours (if I live long enough) finds us in the beginnings of a
transition. Those before us were perhaps in the middle and found the turmoil of nations as the striving to save what gold standard existed.

Obviously, gold plays a major roll in transporting ones savings across the stormy seas. That's easy to say for those that possessed gold even 60 years ago, much more so centuries ago. The more recent owners did not lose money in banks during the liquidity crunch of the 30s. Yes their
gold was taken by law, but their wealth was largely intact if it was held as gold "in hand" (or gold certificates "in hand", as the dollar was). The function of physical, saved the day.

Today, savers face a unique circumstance. Never before in history has a generation grown up essentially using a world fiat reserve currency. Many of our present elected officials are but a decade or two more in age than the mass of humanity they govern. I wonder how many of them are a good study of economic currency history?

--------Note that since the US has a higher interest rate than the rest of the G7, excepting the UK, there is a disadvantage in US non dollar denominated obligations that has accumulated via the carry trades. The profitability of the trades was based on the fact that they produce more $ than they consume SF, Yen or Euro, by a hefty margin, thus producing another supply of dollars. The meaning of all this is that the US has to export $ as debt payments even if the US were to stop its trade deficit in its tracks. ------

ORO,
This process has/can feed on itself. If it was not for the foreign Central Banks buying up much of the excess dollars created by our trade deficit, the "past" US interest rates would have been even higher. Today, the ECB has largely withdrawn from this supporting function. See the chart of total foreign net US debt purchases I offered earlier(if you have one?). It has now fallen back to 1980
levels. Without the private foreign citizen purchases, it could be considered that a run on the dollar has started.

This is leaving mostly the hedge fund community to use their 100 to 1 leverage to further accumulating US debt in the carry trade. Yet, these private international funds are not CBs and their trading can benefit the dollar debt only so much. If the market reacts against them they (unlike
CBs) must close out or seek support. From this viewpoint we understand why the Fed is now buying so much debt in open market operations. Truly, they would feel better about it if it was done for Y2K concerns.

You are right in that the exporting of US debt (using carry trades?) adds to our payments deficit. However, I suspect that the US Fed knows that most of this debt will return quickly as these trades are unwound. The negative effects of "outbound dollars as interest payments" is a minor concern when faced with the eventual aspect of buying in all of this "leveraged debt" that has no other home.

With the BOJ now backing away also, any sudden rush of additional dollar export needs to fund foreign purchaces could initiate a crash in the fund sector. I believe the present rising oil prices are just such a play against the dollar. Even though the rise in oil prices still increases the need for more worldwide dollars to settle sales, the rise in local US inflation will force the dollar down at the same time that the fed must buy massive debt. Therefore, rates will be forced lower or held in place until
inflation is completely out of hand.

As for the Hedge funds: One day, falling exchange rates for the dollar against the Euro, will force the Forex markets to spread this drop everywhere equally. That fails their leverage from existing carry more so than a rise in rates. At some strategic point in the middle of all of this a voice will be heard that asks for the settlement of oil in a basket of items (dollars, Euros, gold?). This trigger will
unleash a dynamic more far reaching than the first series of OPEC oil repricing.


--------My current quest is to determine the speed of the action and its timing, without regard to non-US financial or political events that may cause renewed flight into the dollar (China devaluation, War in Europe or Asia, tc.). ---------

I believe a worldwide dollar retreat has started. Hedge funds are trapped into liquidating Yen carry positions at a loss. With the FED already buying this returned debt with both hands, there is little they can now do to slow the rise of the YEN. This rise in the YEN will bring further turmoil to the Asian block and start them moving towards the Euro and gold. Eventually, the imports of physical gold into Asia will create the premium in "street gold" that also breaks the paper markets. We shall see.

-----------This is from Ted Butler's Sept.5, 1999 analysis on the above web site. What I am miffed over is the contention that Central Banks have leased up to half there gold. I thought and believed that the Bullion Banks were the lenders to the markets and that the CB's were lender's of last resort or Guarantor's of these loans and therefore still had there gold. ---------------

Hello Steve,
I don't believe Mr. Butler is right about this. His viewpoint is not uncommon, as many gold analysts also think the Cbs have actually moved their gold. I will not fully repeat my thoughts about this, but will make a few comments.

Yes, some gold has left the CB vaults as it was sold into the marketplace. Weather it was as outright sales or outsourced as leases, that gold was used to supply "real demand". If we look clearly, most of the "outright sales" were done by countries instituting policies that more closely aligned their currencies within new and old economic blocks. Belgium into the EMU or Canada into the dollar sector. Even in these cases, the "real demand" for gold could have been other CBs buying.

Gold sold as "leases" was also real, but in a very small amount. The industrial demand for gold is not that large that the deficit could not be supplied with the draw down of private world stocks. That is investors selling gold and buying paper gold IOUs. Also note that any investor demand for physical gold sold in the leasing process would find that gold left in the CB vaults with only the title
transferred. World players, buying on that scale do not move gold around. Never the less, CB gold held as "storage" would definitely not be counted as Treasury stock.

The WGC has said several times that the "NET" draw down of world CB gold holdings amounts to only 300+/- tonnes over ten years. That 30 ton per year looks about right when one considers the flow of large bank bullion bars into the melting pots.

The CBs would never hold that many "gold receivable" notes as a percentage of actual holdings. Some, yes. Thousands of tonne, never! In some countries, people disappear and are never seen again for doing less of a deception. Ask Cmax?

The CBs still hold and own their gold. They have given their "good name" to guarantee delivery if needed, but until that bridge must be crossed, the gold stays put. This will all come to a head soon. In that time the paper holders of "uncommitted gold" will find that "unsettled market conditions" will allow BBs and CBs to settle most of the ownership problems in cash. This is why a true short
covering rally will mostly fail. However, the resulting blow to the markets will destroy the present gold system as we know it.

There will be bitter feelings by many "thought to be gold investors" when some people have real gold that is soaring in price on the street as the world financial system turns over.

Also: Stagflation? It was never a word in the English language until the dollar went off the gold exchange standard. Prior, there was currency inflation (with price increases) or currency deflation (with prices falling). Explanation: Economist of the 70s would not admit that a currency could not be controlled if operating outside it's connection with gold. Yet, the early stages of a currency
inflation produce the exact same effect we were having. Could not be inflation, so it must be a derivative! Call it stagflation. Much better for the ego! (Smile)

FOA $ Death spiral
--- Note that the increase in interest rates from 4.75 to 6% increases $ outflow by 25%. -----

ORO, this is the real glue that holds the FED in place. One of the reasons the DOW "was" allowed to run so long. The old treasury chief, Mr. RR was big on moving US maturities into the short side. Much money was saved here and made things look better without exposing the risk that rising rates would produce. Now the game must go into uncharted territories as any rise in rates spikes not only the foreign payments flow, but blows a hole in our "new national budget surplus"! The long bond at 6% is bad, but it's the short side that moves the effects so quickly down the pipe. Foreign players know this and will run before the act!

Persons that really know Mr. Greenspan think he now must allow the dollar to fall in order to lower the DOW. Some say it's the lesser of two evils. I think it's the least of three dozen evils.

-------------The next issue is the "eurodollar" the non-US $ denominated debt.
1. Emerging Market $ demand to settle $ debt. This has been one of the major sources of support for $ value. (c) Currently, there is a movement of some countries to replace $ debt with Euro debt, reducing it further. This will no longer provide support for $ value against real goods and the currencies of the EMs.-----------

Absolutely! I used your (c) because it has, for myself, the most effective dynamic upon the dollar value. It leaves the Eurodollar base with no purpose. Foreign CBs must take it in exchange for their local currencies because the open market would quickly discount this arena. Yet, the CBs in the EMU no longer have any need for US reserves? I think Another had it on mark when he said they would eventually dump dollars on the market and buy gold. At the same time building the Euro structure. The problem is they will not be using the LBMA. Still another reason that the bulk of the
Swiss gold sales (if they happen at all) will eventually be done for Euros, not dollars.

I think, every time the Euro buys another gold ounce, a dollar will be sent back to the US. If trade restrictions block that flow, they will literally burn cash in the streets. The rise in gold and Euros will more than replace the lost reserves. I read this point in your next item:

---------2. 16 odd $trillion more in Eurodollars have accumulated and compounded from the current accounts deficits of the last 30 years. (a) No amount of interest earnings would be attractive enough to keep it from "going back home" to bid for whatever it can buy. (b) much of it is going to "money heaven" as loans are repaid or replaced with Euro and Yen loans. (c) The small remnant is a cash account that will be spilled into the market.--------

Also, you say:

-------I think the oil backing for $ will fade rather than turn overnight, in the interest of not aggravating the country with so many fighters and bombers in the oil area. (a) Some will buy Euro, (b) much oil will eventually trade directly for Euro. --------------

This will all depend upon how serious Iran and Arabia become. Your assessment is right if they remain distant partners. However, world affairs have a way of changing motives. They may join the EMU, directly. Could you imagine the ECB and their central parliament not openly courting such a move? I also doubt the US would stop defending the region, even if they went off the dollar standard. In a future context, with the dollar already down, such a move might be accepted by the US??

--------Reindustrialization:-----------

Very interesting!

-----FOA, What do you think is the likelihood of the EU, Japan, and oil producers keeping things in slow motion? How likely do you think they are to succeed?------

One chance in ten! (smile) I think a breakdown will rapidly proceed into perhaps a 20% destruction phase. Then governments will lock up the entire trade finance picture. One of the reasons I believe a Eurozone investment will work better. They will quickly align with China and Lesser Asia as a closed trading block. One of the reasons Japan does not want to create a currency block in their neighbourhood. Their other players would "cut and run" to Europe at the
first sign of dollar destruction. Japan is with the US until the end and will suffer the same fate.

-----Note on "Secret POG", a $985-1000/oz implied price from balancing the current accounts with US sourced gold debt was steady within a +/- 2% band over 1995-1998 Q3, through all the volatility. The implied price seems to have risen rapidly since then to the $1500 range. Numbers are still preliminary and are a "work in progress" without my full confidence.----------

Unless someone actually saw a truck leaving the Dutch central bank with 150 tonnes of 400 ounce gold bars in it, I expect this bank is "committed" to supply gold the market ("if needed" to support a lease).
Also, if MA is short 200 to 400 tonnes of gold, was it only a paper short with another group of "bet takers" on the other side of the fence?? Would CBs actually play with these people, or did this fund work only through BBs? With thousands of these private hedge deals out there, this could

PH and Steve,
Not long ago I wrote a post to PH about "the final convulsion starting". I thing this PRINCETON deal could kick it off. The repost by SEQUIN from Kitco is a good explanation of how entangled these things can get. Someone here (or somewhere) mentioned that because this is a
criminal involvement, it will not be handled as quietly as the LTCM affair. Indeed, the first of many affairs to be revealed!

Part of SEQUIN:
------Princeton has sold the GOLD borrowed from bullion dealers ( JP MORGAN is the mostprominent of PRINCETON's counterparts ) to invest in leveraged transactions.-----

Steve, In my FOA (09/14/99; 07:52:20MDT - Msg ID:13612) I made a point about how important it was weather the CB vault gold was actually moved in these deals. Again, some of gold is actually moved from the vaults and sold into the open. But it's only a small part of the total structure in the paper gold markets. Sequin's post also makes a point that this hedge fund does deals with a BB, not the CBs. In most of these deals, the BBs are sourcing the gold from world private stocks and using the CBs as the backup. The private investors (who supplied the gold) can then hold a bank certificate, committing the institutions word that gold is credited to the owners account. Both understand that gold isn't in the account but the banks reputation stands behind it. In return, the owner can divert 95% of their old gold capital into other more productive markets. This is how the game is played and it is compelling for holders of old-line gold stocks.

The CBs name is on the deal to ship gold in the event of default. Hence, the low interest rates they (the CBs) receive are nothing more than a very high fee for the use of their name. I put this in the open now and it should tell a new story for everyone. This latest event allows another chess player to be moved on the board. We see better down the trail.

The real problem is not the return of gold to the CB, rather that the CB may actually have to tell it's citizens (using public bookeeping) that they now must write real "ownership certificates" to the BBs. I'm telling everyone "it is not going to happen"! As the owners of the gold certificates, written by the BBs, begin to get nervous, they will liquidate their invested moneys and send it to the BBs
asking for "clear title accounts", replacing the "gold credit accounts". This is where "it" hits the fan!
After years of building these accounts, the BBs now must buy "real street gold" (Thank You Mr.H.) because the CBs will force them to. The Euroland banks (like the dutch item below) will no longer expand their commitments. Weather the BBs borrow it (creating a huge liability for themselves in the process), or buy it from a physical dealer, it must be in "block form". Spot, paper, IOUs will not do.

The impact on the established gold paper markets will be as such: They will try to cover their liability by selling as much "long" "in the distant delivery" gold paper as possible before the market fails. This is why the paper gold markets cannot reflect a spiking, "demand driven" physical gold price in this circumstance. Yes, Mr. "Chicken Man" (USAGOLD poster), the public investors may try to run into the various gold futures markets, gunning up the OI and creating a maybe short-term spike. However, they will be meat with an ocean of selling that ironically, is based upon the demand for real gold???? The lease rate spike is the only paper present indication that physical is in an outright corrnered situation!

Having said all of that, I point out that the Dutch central bank (yesterday) further clarified their 150 tonne commitments to gold leasing. This is in addition to my comments from FOA (09/14/99;16:46:40MDT - Msg ID:13646). (here is part of the later article):

--Dutch netted $100/oz in interest from 1992 gold sale---
Updated 10:10 AM ET September 14, 1999
By Marius Bosch
LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) -

The Netherlands currently allowed up to 150 tonnes of its gold reserves to be lend into the gold market, Lamers said.
"An important consideration in planning an expansion was that our share in the size of the gold lease market should not become too large.
"We increased it to 150 tonnes in the course of 1997 and it is likely to remain there for the time being," he said.
Lamers said criticism from producers over the activities of
central banks in lending gold is difficult to fathom.------
So, what do we gather from this statement? Yes, they could have shipped the gold. OR: They could have shipped part of it. OR: They could have it "committed" to the lease market as part of a leasing deal?

As these deals begin to fail from major currency fluctuations, the fallout will become to big to cover up. We shall see.

ORO,
If you saw my post FOA (9/15/99; 9:04:23MDT - Msg ID:13672).To continue our discussion:

Using the BBs as pipelines, we can see how gold was sourced from many private western accounts and sold to entities wanting physical holdings. Because no account or trail was ever produced to indicated the flow of this gold it created the perfect avenue for accumulation while
moving the world price lower.

Attention was never focused on who or where this gold was going, because everyone only wanted to know the whys and whatfors the price is going down. Yet, here we are, in the last part of 99, the Euro is firmly established, ECB gold commitments have fallen away and what is the result? Oil is rising in dollars, against all odds! The gold for oil deals are over, leaving the LBMA in a pickle and the new Euros for oil is in the works!

I expect the dollar / yen market to wipe out the currency carry trade for hedge funds and in the process lock up the gold carry trade. Small buyers can still get physical gold, but large players will be competing with the BBs for the big bars.

Look at how the Yen perception is blowing up in a media item yesterday:

---Fears of capital flight
The fall in the dollar is being driven by fears that foreign investors will withdraw money from the over-valued US stock market and put it into foreign securities, especially in Japan, where the Nikkei index enjoyed strong growth this year.

Japanese investors, who have funded much of the US trade deficit by buying US government bonds, are believed to be repatriating substantial amounts of capital.

"Foreign investors are asking themselves why they should keep funding the US to consume itself silly," said Tony Northfield of ABN Amro Bank.

The falling dollar could itself precipitate a sharp drop in the US stock market, which has been boosted in the past year by a massive influx of foreign funds and the strong dollar.-----

of the system as it is set up. I think, Another was, all along, trying to imply that this perception of
manipulation as seen by the industry and investors was really the reflection of a "false perception of what our modern gold markets had become". People thought they were working an investment angle based upon the usual "supply and demand" concepts with a little "gold is money / inflation
hedge" thrown in. The whole market has changed. The problem was that every time some $50 million asset investor walked in the door with, say one million to place in gold, he had to wade through something like a used car lot of derivative sales people. Never mind the guy has 49 mill still in his pocket, he was labled insane to put the whole 1 mill into physical gold. Use our products to hold this much in .............and then we can.......and don't forget the gold shares....and!!! You get the picture. The exact same happened to guy that had an old storehouse of physical.

Anyway,,, the selling we are seeing that's blocking the price on the established exchanges is the effects of the industry adjusting to a change in the marketplace. People win, people lose and life goes on. You and I would do just the same financially, as soldiers in a trench do when it's all falling apart. When out of bullets, heave your helmet at the enemy.

Any financial entity that is involved in the paper gold game will be buying, selling, hedging everything in sight, in any possible combination to raise liquidity if they are under siege. "Boys, forget how this will play out tomorrow, we must save today"! ORO knows how it works.

Ross, this will not play out exactly as I see it. Football games are fought all over the field, never won or lost where one referee threw the flag. Another only tells me where to look. It's up to us to make sure we see the whole field.

Thanks FOA

Question for FOA: When you posit "buying in the outer paper contracts" to cover the problem here in the present aren't you suggesting a spike in those contracts? Wouldn't that blow up the whole game just as well?

PH,
We are not dealing with just the Comex futures. There is a whole world of paper trading that goes on off markets. You never can tell if someone is neutralizing their trades in another arena? Unfortunately, it is true that the human reaction to a death in the family, is to grab control of as much of the family business money (or gold) as possible before the courts (or sec) lock everything up. We were not born saints. You and I have been there and seen that. No?

Again, anyone that holds rare coins or physical will stand outside the risk and view all of this as an interesting motion picture. Probably the best run of a screen play any of us will see! Anyone that starts a relationship with the USAGOLD will be dealing with a solid group for an enjoyable financial lifetime. Believe it.

ORO,
Excellent write-up! I have a few other observations that may be considered.

Your post:----------Morgan is probably borrowing either to sell to Armstrong's account or to have the gold in hand when Armstrong's loan comes due and it can't be payed off.--

This is the same thing that happened when several other small funds (no media news for them) went down. Their gold carry trade was covered by borrowing gold and paying short rates. Usually these deals eventually get signed off for year term at the then high monthly rate. The problem is that
the borrowed gold position has to be carried indefinitely by the bank. Someone (gold lender) keeps a "loaned gold" account open with them and the bank keeps paying interest. Recently, these sort of things are becoming more common and the banks positions of borrowed gold to cover lost gold is
growing. The LTCM deal is still out there, draining someone that has borrowed gold to cover that lost item. This is where a rising lending rate can become very damaging as these "rollover loans" get repriced. Now the Armstrong deal may develop another "long term" gold loan (200++ tonne??) to
cover more un-returned collateral.

Your post:----Remember that these are banks, and they will not own gold outright, ever.

True, they don't own gold because it's not part of their job description. Also, balancing risk is common business as they trade off income against outgo. But, they cannot hedge the risk of them having to "calling physical" from a paper market if the paper market can't deliver! Yes they hedge
the price as long as the futures function, but these "loan loss" accounts are for real gold that someone will want back some day. And this is now a growing bank loss position, not some deal with a fund.

Here is the area of real risk to the market creating power of the BBs. The gold loan accounts not backed by the CBs can blow up if major currency swings destroy the hedge funds. At some point, thousands of tonnes of "real street" gold would have to be borrowed by these banks in order to
return it to the private owners. Funny how a private owner of wealth will lend it to an institution for a business deal (no matter how risky it is) as long as the bank stands behind it. Yet, people "cut and run" if they think they are lending to a bank to cover it's loses.

Like I said in my #13672: -------'Weather the BBs borrow it (creating a huge liability for themselves in the process), or buy it from a physical dealer, it must be in "block form". Spot, paper, IOUs will not do. -----

The high lease rates may be attracting enough interested parties to roll over loans, or they may not. If rates keep rising as the YEN gets stronger (as they appear to be doing), it will signal a changed situation in the Gold carry trade. The simple Arab gold positions that work a trade for
interest are way to small. (I never acknowledge these because it confuses the oil/gold issue). To support a growing default in the BB trade will require the heavy depth of the government (oil) positions to save them. These (the real oil/ gold positions) will do nothing without ECB / BIS
backing.

Let's let this cook for a few weeks. If the fallout grows large enough, no amount of paper hedging will cover the calls for real delivery. I bet GS hits the OCT contract for more material ( if any is left by then).

Thanks for discussing. FOA

FOA where does y2k fit into this mayhem? Was it supposed to be the scapegoat for the dollar collapse or was it not supposed to happen?

Hello Aggie,
I can't spread myself over too many subjects, but lately I've had more time. Your Y2K note is of concern, but I don't think it will be the disaster many think it will become. Some oil supply and end product problems, yes. Some banking functions lost, yes. Lots of government downtime, yes. Third
world, developing nation and trading partner upsets, yes.

Still, all in all, a big aggravation but no total loss of economic function. BUT, our place in the timeline of economic change could magnify these problems into a larger scale. Mathematically, we are ending the ability of the dollar to function as a reserve currency. It's debt load (offshore) simply will not expand any further. Someone's dollar holdings must be destroyed if another is to be
created. Hence, the major currency destruction in other countries.

Look at this chart (found it somewhere?) of the US trade deficit over the years. It's exploding now and should be performing it's past function of expanding world liquidity in proportion to it's yearly increases. It's not! We are sending dollars overseas in an ever larger pipeline and economies are still contracting. Japan is going down and the YEN jump is the effect of that continuing downturn. I don't care what anyone says, a falling YEN has always been a precursor of a rising GDP in Japan. Their currency only rose in 1985 because the G-7 forced it up. Otherwise it would
have fell in a normal context of their trade. Their whole structure is unique in that it is a sub function of the US economy. Their downturn from the early 90s is an example of the forces in effect that are taking the dollar out of reserve status. Again, people talk about the Yen being the foundation of a new currency block. Not if the major components of their GDP is a function of selling products into the US markets. If the US sinks, taking the dollar function with it, Japan will be mired in a 30s style
depression.

All of these cross currents are "out of norm" so the computer models keep turning out losing trades. The YEN carry is caught, big time in this. If the loses keep building right into the Y2K problems, public perception is going to be hurt as the media hurls this "new economic news" at them. Will K2 be the scapegoat, you ask? If this downturn gets a big as I think, the K2 news will be washed into the background as "not that important". And you understand that is saying a lot about how bad this may become.

Unfounded rumour? Question for FOA (and others)
FOA:
is no one going to even bring up, much less comment on the idea making the rounds (heard at a large, well known gold retail brokerage) linking the 200-700 ton (possible) shortfall about to be defaulted on by Princeton International with a rumoured Swiss offer to cover the deficit with leased metal?

Hello PH,
Sure, that will work! While waiting for the time to sell our gold, we can make some return on it by lending it to several BBs that are already paying loan interest on over 1,600 ton of previous loss covers. And yet if the YEN just stays where it is, some 2,200 tonne more would also be at risk. Don't mention what will happen if the YEN goes to 60?????? UH-OH, did I say all that? Must be another of those silly rumours going around.

It all just goes to show you how small these gold sale announcements really are. Not only that, why these real gold sales are happening at all. The BOE sales are only a stopgap measure to keep the system operating. They knew they didn't have anything close to enough gold to reverse the trend. Hence their banging on everyone's doors for more sales. I tell you the IMF "new deal" was a "MAJOR" reversal for them. The members of their gold association are going to be paying on mountains of reclaimed gold debt if someone doesn't hurry up and sell some physical before the paper gold market fully crashes.

Does anyone here see what I'm talking about? Is it no wonder GATA is barking up the wrong tree, thinking that the hedge funds are going to start a big short covering rally. The CBs and the BBs would take them out and shoot them before allowing these funds to cover outright. Oh, a run could get started, but it will quickly die.
Yes, the gold was sold and is owed to someone (mostly not CBs). But, if the funds lose the money created from those sales, the BBs and FED banks have no choice but to cover the bad gold debt. Still, at some point even they are way over their head! The whole gold price making system will have to fail and shut down completely before they would allow those loans to be market to a real "street gold market"! They will Mark those loan losses and carry them at $250 or lower to retain bookkeeping assets. Then keep paying interest to customers that won't have a dream of getting their gold back. Then shut the market down and the street price will zoom! Just wait and watch, it will all play out.

With all of this in the background, gold option investors really think their broker will be able to match sales and credit their accounts with profits???


"Hello, Mr. Broker, now that the world gold market has collapsed, I have decided I want to take delivery. Here is my money, please deliver the two Jan $360 Comex future contracts that my option says I can call. After that I want to exercise one $360 future for physical and close out the
other for cash.
What did you say? It's all shut down? But my coin dealer says gold is at $3,247.17 an ounce. I've got good profits on this trade. What, call the SEC and the CBT? I don't want to talk to them, hello,,,, hello,,,,hello???

Comment!
To ALL:

A few more parts to the puzzle may be falling into place. We might even say that the next act in the play is starting.
It's a foregone conclusion that the IMF has been forced to revalue their gold. Most everyone gives the US congress credit for this action. True, they did make it clear how the voting would go if a "sell gold" proposal came before them. But, the selling of gold was only one part of a larger
proposal to further fund the IMF. Given the terrible record of "good money down the hole", not only was the single debt relief provision for poor nations at the center of the funding debate, so too was the question of the existence and need for the IMF in the background.

The current problem facing the IMF is in justifying more member commitments that allow the continuation of their operations. It can be looked at two ways: 1. They either are in a squeeze for funds because the extraordinary failure of their policies now require much more money. OR 2. They have been put in a squeeze, more so because major member contributors will no longer support a policy of maintaining foreign dollar debt at the expense of nations outside the IMF/Dollar block.

Indeed, politically one must wonder; why support a system that is built upon a "strong dollar" policy for the benefit of only one country? This rift was opened wider during the last two years as the very "strong dollar policy" that flowed from the US, is the very catalyst that has helped destroy the assets in nations now absorbing most of the IMF flow.

A major item that has been part of this US support structure for the dollar was the G-10 policy on gold. The falling gold price, as seen in the world reserve currency has contributed immensely to the ongoing settlement of all trade in dollars. Indeed, the very continuation of the world trade system. Leading the dollar support component of trade was the use of crude oil settlement in dollars. That one item required practically every nation on earth to buy dollars (or at the least run a positive dollar trade balance with other dollar holding countries) to pay for oil. (NOTE: this post assumes the reader has retained the knowledge presented in the USAGOLD Hall of Fame posts)

If a low gold price (indicating a strong dollar) could induce an overflow production of oil, then oil prices in dollars would fall. A steady, neutral or falling price of oil was always an indication that the settlement of oil in dollars would continue side by side with the purchase of BB leveraged gold securities. In addition, the continued physical function of the established world gold markets was
paramount in holding this oil support for the dollar. When the day comes that the paper contract gold markets are seen as "in question", the flow of oil will slow and it's price in dollars will rise. From early this year, this process has begun.

The beginnings of this change was born in the success of the EMU. With that Euro creation, the ECB/BIS has slowed, stopped and now reversed it's support to lower the price of gold in dollars. In effect, for them, the worlds reserve currency position is now slowly changing towards the Euro.
Every day, new evidence emerges that shows Euro liquidity becoming as deep as the dollar with little threat of "dirty float" interventions in exchange rates. The fact that Euro interest rates have remained below the dollar rates indicate this currency's long term perception of strength.

The ECB can now slowly phase out dollar reserves as the Euro assumes more of the world trade settlement function. A function in and of itself, that will further lower the dollars world need, use and therefore value. Because the US still runs a trade deficit, it still ships a surplus of dollars to most countries. In today's new Euro world, the dollar exchange rate will eventually be forced to fall
enough to balance this flow. Further, a falling dollar will release ECB dollar reserves as fair game to buy physical gold from any and all entities. However, this buying will most likely be through the BIS and member CBs, not the over leveraged LBMA or world gold paper.

In addition; Because the Euroland external debt is very low compared to the US and they posses a positive trade balance, a rising price of gold reserves (in Euros or dollars) will support their currency with extra reserve value. Their policy of marking gold reserves to market (on a
quarterly basis) and eventually establishing a "true physical" marketplace offers every enticement to get the dollar (and Euro) price of gold higher. Because this process creates a unique reserve benefit, not used in the old gold standard. they will never officially back the Euro with gold. Rather allow a new "free market" in physical gold (not paper) to supplement their currency operations. The
efficiency of modern trade require a digital currency. That need alone will always support the use of a currency. If gold can trade beside paper money, neither will drive the other out of circulation (as old money gold coins did to paper gold money) as long as they can each seek their own
values. ( a very interesting concept??)

During the last several years, the dollar established gold exchanges created more paper gold than existing gold could ever cover. All done in an effort to create additional world support for a strong dollar. The middle of last year, it became apparent that the successful Euro launch would,in time remove most of the major physical (sales and lending and lending guarantees) support from this marketplace. The result was an IMF/dollar move to sell the physical gold of others into the paper gold arena. In as much as this supply would help, the continued further building of "fractional gold paper" has completely overwhelmed any ability for large physical stocks to cover it. I believe, the BOE sales have been part of a last ditch effort to salvage their London gold operations. Truly, the last round fired in this final battle.

Today, all roads point to a break-up of the world established gold pricing system, as settled in dollars. The IMF gold hoard is constrained to stay in place from lack of further world support for the debt of the dollar block community. The US has changed it's view of gold and views this IMF holding as the only asset that can still be used to support their floating dollar debt overseas. They did this because when a chain reaction of defaulting on foreign dollar reserve debt begins, the dollar would quickly crash!
In choice, the IMF must either release/sell their gold back to the original countries that committed said gold into the IMF, or revalue and use it as money. I think the USA congress knew they needed that gold to remain in the IMF system. They used the "gold fire sale hurting debtors"
story as a political ploy to block the gold returns. Let's face it, IMF members would have been glad to return unusable dollar reserves into the IMF for gold. Especially with the ECB thinking of buying other CB gold through the BIS using Euros! In any event all now know, the IMF gold path has
been chosen. This will become the trail of no return for the dollar.

Each new revaluation and money usage of gold will bring further reductions of member dollar support for IMF operations. Perceptions will slowly change, especially when oil is seen priced better in a gold "friendly" currency. In a reverse of policy, higher gold will bring cheaper oil. With each further IMF budget reduction, gold will be revalued again higher to create more reserves. One has but to grasp that this is no longer subject to SDR (also a dollar/IMF creation) paper calculations. This is the absolute revaluation of physical gold for official world debt settlement. The SDR articles will slowly die in this atmosphere. As will the Arabian currency link to SDRs. Perhaps a link to the Euro or complete EMU will occur?

Today, gold has just become set free as "money". In time, officials will review their need to "lend" gold for a return, where as they may "revalue" gold to create a increasing reserve source. As gold rises, there will be "no contest" in this conflict of thought.

With physical gold being quickly withdrawn from a position of support for the established world paper exchanges, the imbalance will become very visible in "lending rates". As these rates rise, the gold pricing market as we all know it will grind to a halt. I am sure it will be closed for "renovation", use your best imagination. In 1968, on 15 of March, the US asked for the closure of the London gold markets. On 1 of April it reopened, fixing in dollars for the first time. This time I expect the official dollar gold markets will not reopen for a long time.

It was pointed out to me that our great world gold market is the most liquid it has ever been. The members have many reserves and even insurance companies to back them. I completely agree! They will not fail one investor with the lack of cash settlement for all remaining, unsettled claims.
The dollar/IMF block of countries will print whatever money is needed to clear out this arena. Just as the US, once before called in gold and settled up in "local gold backed cash" because the foreign dollar gold loans had failed , this time will they call in "real gold paper" and settle in "absolute fiat cash".

Some say gold will be confiscated! I reply as in the "Bear Joke" about two hikers confronting a bear. I don't have to out run the bear, says one to the other, I only have to out run you. My friend, in that day of gold turmoil, I will hold my gold and have but to only outrun you! For people with goods to sell will SEEK MY GOLD FOR ECONOMIC TRADE, not the government collection man.

Buy physical gold to hold. In the time to come, this money in the hand will out perform any investment you have every known. Few today accept just how high physical gold will rise. Be a part of the "physical gold advocates" and tell a story your grandchildren will grow tired from
hearing!

The Road to $30,000
Peter Asher (9/19/99; 22:10:12MDT - Msg ID:13951)

Peter,
Thanks for offering your comments and reasoning. We are entering a period unlike any of recent experience. Using the Western view, we rely on our own extended family lifetimes as a history reserve to build a perspective for upcoming events. After all, America "the new country" has been a
financial power for only half it's lifetime. The recent hundred years or so does not present an honest picture of true human financial dealings. The world has been recently dominated and fixated with the use of one currency system to express all world trade dealings. Yet that system has repeatedly failed the test of measuring it's function in gold.

This time period holds no tested precident and only shows an onrush of changes in a kind of high speed evolution. As such, all of our present acceptance of holding each others debts, as "evidence of real wealth" has never been tried in fire. Each controversy was meet with more promises of a better tomorrow, only if we accept just a little more debt as savings. Again, to date that debt has
never been measured in the real purchasing power environment of a "great" world economic downturn. Rather, it has always been held and measured within the realm of "good times". It's only during a "real downturn" that your wealth "quality" is measured in a comparative true historical
backdrop. Not the brokerage reports that hold that the early 70s was rough!

This generation will experience what happens when a competing medium is allowed to function beside our accepted measuring stick (the dollar). The resulting contraction into a "normal" world trade environment that destroys bad "economic functions" will leave the current dollar system in
flames.

Many seem to express a sense of loss with this view point. I submit that you can't lose what you never owned? When an entire society upvalues their savings (stocks, bonds, savings accounts) because the world supplies them with real wealth in exchange of their IOUs; those savings are always open for revaluation in the event the IOUs are no longer accepted at par. Shifts in world financial structures render uncertain times. Those times require the valuation of assets upon what they will buy "now", not what they purchase in the future.

Events proceed, with or without our understanding of them. In the past, those without understanding held physical gold and slept well without knowing why. Such will be the case for many during this "Time of Transition".

Thanks again, and keep poking a contrary opinion through every hole. The football game is won on the entire field, not just where the water boy like myself stands. FOA

A simple view...
Your hard work finds its reward according to what effort you choose. You may stack, then unstack stones, or carry them randomly, gaining nothing to show for your labour other than a salty brow. But if you stack stones with a PURPOSE, you will gain a wall. Or, you may break the ground and plant seeds, battling weeds and nature's many competing hungry mouths. There is no reward during the growing season, but the bounty gained from the final work of harvest compensates for all.

As demonstrated with the stones, if there is no meaningful purpose to guide the effort, there follows no meaningful reward. But each carefully placed stone brings you incrementally and irreversibly closer toward the real wealth of a wall and lasting shelter. As seen with the garden, each nurturing effort is made with good faith and much hope held for a successful future harvest. While many uncertainties of nature offer calamities beyond the gardener's ability to defend, it too often happens that a sudden event (hail storm or untimely frost) renders for nought a long series of otherwise purposeful efforts.

Money allows for the division of labour such that specialists may participate incrementally in a purposeful
process of efforts, and yet be able to share (in due measure) in the wealth created through the combined efforts. A stonecutter and bricklayer may each participate in the building of many walls intended for the use and benefit of others. It is the meaningful payment of money that allows them to willingly walk away from the real wealth of these walls finished for others; receiving as substitute the equivalent wealth in traveling form. Similarly, a planter and an irrigator may walk away from a maturing field after accepting a meaningful equivalent payment of money for their appropriate earned share of the total real wealth to be reaped by the harvester alone.

Money is seen here as the portable proxy for real wealth. Payments received may be viewed as equivalent to the incremental efforts made toward the finished shelter or the mature crop. As you take care to provide a meaningful effort within a civilization of divided labour to merit some payment, so too should you take care to ensure the money you hold is a reflection of effort of a kind that is meaningful, certain, and IRREVERSIBLE.

Accepting Monopoly money when working for others is as moving stones randomly without purpose...you have the sweat on your brow to show, and no more.

Choosing instead one of the many national fiat currencies is better than Monopoly money, but it is a money akin to the efforts at gardening during the growing season. The culmination of a long series of meaningful efforts may too easily result in "no harvest" from events beyond your control. With actual gardening, the lost efforts of one growing season may be a blow you might painfully absorb. However, with this "garden of currency", a failed harvest negates not only one season, but indeed may destroy a lifetime of efforts.

Best of all choices is that for gold. Each payment held as gold is akin to building a wall for a shelter--an irreversible placement of stone, ever progressing toward successful and certain completion. Or put in terms of the garden, gold most nearly represents the successful harvest, completely avoiding the risks of the uncertain growing season.

Do not make the mistake of trying to compare the "performance" of money with the performance of stocks. To have a stock is to have spent your money on rights to a share of a corporation's profit, if any. You are buying partial ownership of other construction firms or agri-businesses. If no dividends are paid on earnings, then you must question the merits of holding a share of such a corporation. Perhaps you are relying upon the "greater fool" theory, hoping to sell at a higher price to someone else. Or perhaps you hold with hopes of future dividends to be paid on future earnings. In turn, consider the wisdom shown in their own choice of monetary earnings. Do they transact in Monopoly money, or pesos, or roubles, or dollars...and what happens to the fortunes of that corporate entity when an unstoppable hail storm damages their cultivated garden of currency? Any corporation may either prosper or fail, and perhaps your stock with perform accordingly. But it must be recognized that it is money that facilitates efficient markets, division of labor and specialization. Sound money held simply as the ample reward for your labours should not bring you a feeling of shame for from further investment risk on other Builders and Growers Incorporated. Invest a little according to your desire? Sure, but not all.

You should know by know that interest on money is not an inherent parameter of the money itself, but is instead a product of business arrangements, most often found as a share of profits made by banks that risk your money on investments of their choice (typically writing loans). You may keep paper cash in a shoe box, or gold in a shoe box, or invest cash in a bank for interest, or invest gold in a bullion bank for interest. This is how you must evaluate the merits of gold; against other moneys (fiat currencies). There is no fiat currency to be found that bears now a greater value against gold than it did upon its birth. Simply observe the face value printed on any old gold coin to see how far that same stand-alone unit as a fiat currency has fallen. Twenty U.S. dollars, and also twenty Argentine pesos, were once equivalent to nearly one ounce of gold. Eighty German marks was once equivalent to nearly one ounce of gold (the same mark that a short time later intermediately fell to approximately one-trillionth of its former value!). One British pound sterling was once the equivalent to one gold sovereign. One-hundred French francs was once the equivalent of nearly one ounce of gold. Any check of modern gold "prices" will show that these many currencies have fallen significantly in real purchasing value after separation from their original gold definition. Some currencies, notably the dollar, has recently gained back some of its steeper losses only because a current inflated supply of "paper gold" is being priced into the market. (This has been thoroughly discussed at this venerable round table. And further, history reveals that such developments are resolved by a "run" of the competing owners for the limited asset.)

Here is an important "hint" to help your view. Gold need not bear the mark of any national currency to "gain validation" as money. As seen in the preceding paragraph, at one point in time gold held concurrently the many names of dollar, peso, mark, franc, etc. Many names or none, gold remains the same as it ever was...money par excellence. Examine the economic climate of the day and choose your allocation of monetary wealth among currencies and investments accordingly. You will find one question to be more pertinent than others...

for the counter move. Will the BIS make their move to buy gold from CBs in conjunction with the ECB? Did they not buy at $280 ($25 higher from here) because the Euro was still unsteady? Or will they wait as the current paper gold markets burn themselves into oblivion? Will the oil
producers utilize gold in a basket of currencies (perhaps the Euro is a basket compared to the dollar?) as they reprice crude? Or will they wait until the SDR is a complete fiction and useless from IMF workings?

Many things are still on the horizon. Exciting times if your wealth is not at risk. Thanks for your
efforts, FOA

India's Gold Plan: More Reckless Abandon by the IMF
Where will it all end?

PH,
Everyone is holding up the new India plan in the light of BB gold loans. Don't be so sure it's headed in that direction. Banks in India can lend currency against gold holdings. It's not entirely viewed as a currency asset, but it is seen as a worthy collateral to be held as reserves. As such they don't have to lend gold to make a return.

Watch the physical gold import figures and we should see that no major bullion is leaving that country to satisfy world BB paper. The IMF and LBMA would love to paint a picture showing India gold flowing out to balance loans. Especially now that they are trapped. No. The India
operation is going to fit well because the new Dinar offers a different context for that part of the world.

I look for China to flow in the same direction. Absolutely huge amounts of gold were brought into China over the last several years. Yet, these physical flows were not reflected in official Hong Kong bookings, nor were they placed into the Central bank of China accounts. They were holding there cards back from US / IMF eyes just in case they needed to dash for the Euroland economic arena. These people are sharp and can play us for fools in the financial chess game. Just like the India scheme, that gold will not be lent out for IMF / dollar paper. Believe it!
Several large traders brought this gold some time ago through the LBMA when paper was still exercised. Most likely they used the BIS to move that gold. Hence their (BIS) new offices in HK.

It's going to end, PH. But some gold assets will not work during most of this change. We are,

"I hope he has no similar qualms about allowing this particular one to hang on the walls of the HoF."

Hello Aristotle,
No qualms! We can now watch how the oil price rises in fits and starts as the paper gold markets slowly unwind. I would dearly love to see gold run on the established exchanges. Even a $20 or $30 move would really make them sweat as the public guns money into leveraged gold, trying to ride the price increase. Even so, the banking system will most likely sell the public all the gold securities they can buy. They can sell them derivatives to the limit of fiat money creation, in an effort to satisfy paper gold demand. But they can't deliver gold. Watch the OI on Comex and their
Options exchange. Just as ORO presented, the BBs and most paper traders are only interested in laying off risk, not owing gold. As the "modern goldgugs" pile in, so too will the players. All in an effort to balance accounting risk without delivering gold.

With Western thought so ingrained in equating the owning of a "gold price" as the same as owning gold, "this new gold market" will supply them until it fails from it's own weight. All part of "The Road To $30,000". I once expected a huge short rally to break the back of the "gold bear".
So too have most other gold investors. Over many years, now, it never happened as the need to preserve the dollar system was more important than the gold industry itself.

We are clearly on track as the oil producers revalue crude by forcing the dollar prices up, way up! Eventually, the resulting bad debts denominated in dollars will overwhelm not only the IMF but the entire US financial structure. With the Yen killing Japan and leading that region into a further economic contraction, that portion of the currency derivatives trade will become a "black hole" for the US dollar and it's equity markets. Oil will have no choice but to eventually be much more favourably priced in Euros as the process evolves. All of this happening during a backdrop of a crashing paper gold market and a soaring physical price.

How long, oh lord? Obviously, it will not happen within a "gold traders time span". Most will be crushed in their short view operations, if not actually consumed as their asset holdings are revalued. Anyone, (GT?) that can buy physical and hold through out the devastation will financially outlive an army of their trading contemporaries. But, therein is the failure of Western thought as it cannot
contain both the loss of the dollar markets and the skyrocket of physical gold in one mind. Aristotle, we can see the concept as;

"if the price of bread is $50.00, what would the price of gold be?". Not the other way around.

We are "On The Road"........... My friend. Believe it!

PH,
One more point to clarify my post. When I said: "Banks in India can lend currency against gold holdings". I meant that they can use gold somewhat as reserves to make new loans. Just in the same light as dollars deposited in US banks pay interest, but also create loan reserves to earn that interest. Of course, the gold deposits in India will carry a local "gold price" risk, but it's all a function of the internal market. We'll see. FOA

To: FOA Re: The Indian Gold Plan
FOA: Your remarks on the Indian government's interest-bearing gold plan are well-taken. If I understand
them properly, you are suggesting that the intention is to open a sort of government pawn shop where private gold holders can take out collateralized loans by offering their gold as security for currency loans.----------------

PH,
No. I'll try to do a better job. Let's say:
I take Rupee money to a bank, deposit it and get interest on that account. The bank then uses that cash as a fractional reserve and creates loans to others to make said interest.
In another light:
I take gold to the bank, deposit it and receive interest on that account. In one of several options, the bank then "mostly" uses the gold just as it uses "rupee" reserves and creates further rupee loans.

The only difference is that they have some market risk in the price of gold. But, India is very different from the rest of the Western world. Over there, gold is already like money and often used in commerce dealings. This new policy initiative is aimed at expanding the use of gold as money, or at the very least viewing it like stocks or bonds. Watch their import/export numbers. With this new policy in place, I bet even more gold flows into the country. If they are loaning out the gold internationally (I doubt it), in the usual way, gold exports will rise. I think they are paving the way for a simi gold currency in the middle east region. We shall see.

Also: The $30,000 number was always nuts to me. Now I see where it came from. I know, it hurts the credibility to even talk about it. But I'll do it anyway because the odds are for it now, it may work out?? Besides, if we get only a third of the way there I can cover my side of the London/Euro bet with Michael! (smile)

marketplace. Never to be sold again, at any price! My contribution to a management that must have agonized over their actions in that it was a first of a kind public display in complete contrast to most modern miners.
I will do this and encourage any others to put their money behind this company that has so openly moved as a "physical gold advocate"! Some may downplay their actions as unimportant. I applaud them for their bold dynamic leadership during these uncertain times. While other miners
quietly settle hedges by buying in paper commitments, this "GOLDFIELDs" (GOLD) purchase points the investor public towards what is real and what is not.

Hello Chicken Man,
I think you took my statement the wrong way. My purpose is to endorse the actions of Goldfields. The few people I will do this in front of will easily grasp the symbolic meaning of burning the stock. You should also. They have the ear of many influential / political players and I consider
the money well spent to further a cause. My friend, please understand that the ownership of a stock is not lost just because the certificate is gone. I view this as a political endorsement of their "right minded" management. No different than a donation to a good cause. The world gold market would
not be in this fix if investors had allocated the majority of their funds to physical gold first and foremost. After that a small placement of funds into only "right minded mining companies" would have starved the "promoters" into funding "clean gold" companies. I know the hour is late and the end is near, yet, never is there a time not to pursue a just purpose. Others are not asked to follow my exact action. The object of this exercise is to encourage investment in companies that support your thinking.
As for "A guy who has more money than brains"? C Man, all of us have a proportion of wealth that can be used outside our own wants. No? For some it is large, for some it is small. In my position I ask for myself: "if not I who, if not now when? Perhaps this was not appropriate for this

ORO,
Considering the location of our "currency transition timeline", I think the G-7 meeting is going to make or break most of the world markets. If the Yen is allowed to run it will clean out most of the carry trade players that work our currency / debt markets. In addition, because most of them are also part of the "speculative" gold carry crowd, all of them can't possibly be fully hedged with quality counterparties support. This casino has run for so long that good paper is considered as "on par" with any Mexican bank!!

I bet as little as a $30 run in gold will "LTCM" the whole London market. When you consider the derivatives LBMA trades every month, there isn't enough "real equity" out there to cover them. Even if it wasn't already "somewhat" encumbered" by other derivatives.

The figures of what a Yen and gold move would do to the market are truly staggering. I'm afraid you are right in that the equity markets will decimate the gold mine stocks. Long before my function ever kicks in, most every perceived form of wealth will be attached or sold before this is over. With this bear hot on our trail, surely someone must be slower than me? I hope!

More than one POG
--------------

There are many different prices for gold. Or, more accurately, there are many different ways in which gold is formed and stored, and those differences cause prices to differ between the resulting products.

A one-ounce gold JM bar, a Krugerrand, a 1999 U.S. gold Eagle, a slabbed 1908 MS-65 St. Gaudens (ignoring for the moment that it's not precisely one ounce of fine gold), a one-ounce portion of a London Good Delivery bar, a one-ounce portion of a vault claim ticket for same, a one-ounce portion of a futures contract, a one-ounce portion of a derivative contract for same, and one ounce of fine gold formed into a piece of jewellery, all have prices which are somewhat independent of one another.

True, at their core, they all centre around what the market currently feels an ounce of gold is worth, but each has its own additional factors (premiums, risks and quantities) which cause its price to differ, often substantially, from the others.

The U.S. gold Eagle differs in price from both the JM bar and the Krugerrand because of a Patriotism premium. The St. Gaudens differs in price from similarly sized bullion coins because of a Numismatic Rarity premium.

The officially quoted Spot POG differs from the price of one JM bar bought at a coin shop because Spot POG is the price per-ounce at which very large quantities of physical gold trade. By large quantities I mean hundreds-to-thousands of ounces and upwards. Some of these sales are between mining companies and refiners or mints or jewellery manufacturers, where the buyer intends to reshape the metal into some new form, be it ingots, coins, or next month's necklace special at Marks & Spencer.

But in many cases, the purchaser has no plans to remanufacture the gold. Rather, he simply wants to own it. In such cases, the gold itself typically remains in a third-party repository in forms such as London Good Delivery bars (400 ounces), with only the Right to Claim those bars being transferred from buyer to seller.

Since these rights can be transferred electronically, this allows Spot market participants to make brief forays into the market, then retreat, with minimal overhead expense. Money centre banks are better known for their similar operations between paper currencies (buy Swiss Franc sell Yen this morning, then reverse that this afternoon, etc.), but no doubt a great deal of daily Spot POG setting is the result of trading rather than buying to own. Regrettably, I do not have detailed information on the various global Spot markets, so I have no way to discern the proportion of speculators to commercial traders.

In any event, this speculative access to Spot POG makes it susceptible to the same sorts of "professional" day trading which is usually associated with paper markets.

In addition, most of the gold sold at Spot POG has yet another factor influencing it, one which can easily place it more in alignment with the various paper forms of gold when market conditions become abnormal: the risk that the gold is not entirely under the supposed owner's control.

If you have a few gold coins buried in your back yard, and if you bought those coins anonymously with cash, you control that gold. If you have a claim ticket for a few hundred kilograms of gold held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a few hundred tonnes of proven reserves in a mine whose location is known to tax assessors, or even a few dozen U.S. gold Eagles in a unit trust, don't be so sure you're the one in control of that gold.

If or when a breakdown in the paper gold market occurs, it's quite possible we may see the officially quoted Spot POG remain in lockstep with paper prices, very possibly plummeting even in the face of blatant shortages of physical metal. But all this would mean is that a make-believe price is being impressed on market participants who are large enough to be easily identified and coerced.

If a private citizen holds the claim ticket to a London Good Delivery bar stored at the Fed, guess who has the power to insist on knowing details of any sale of said bar. Even if a private citizen takes possession of the bar and buries it in his back yard, Uncle Sam will be very keen to periodically bother him about its whereabouts. Although Spot POG is a measure of physical gold, it adheres to the paper world more so than to the physical world because of this one point: the risk of governmental intervention.

This ties in with points about gold mining shares made by Another and FOA: mining companies theoretically are at liberty to sell to the highest bidder, but governments have a way of convincing their subjects to accept less and be happy with it. If during an emergency the U.S. government were to declare Spot POG to be $50, and if Homestake Mining were to begin selling gold privately at a higher Street POG, the U.S. government could very easily make life unpleasant for Homestake.

By contrast, the government would have a much more difficult time coming after you and the handful of gold coins you've anonymously buried in your back yard. Most likely, they simply wouldn't attempt it. A wise politician never frightens his citizens too much, most particularly during emergencies. A government can achieve its goals by oppressing the majority owners (few in number) of a desired commodity while graciously allowing the minority owners (vast in number) to retain their property.

The confiscation in the U.S. in 1933 was along such lines: the government's intent was to take direct possession of the vast majority of gold within U.S. borders (common gold coins) by pulling them out of circulation, yet not overtly injure citizens who had sentimental or numismatic attachments to specific coins. There weren't any jack-booted thugs banging on Americans' doors after midnight in search of every last gold coin, and I can't imagine any present or future administration doing so either. It's far too expensive to be worthwhile... not to mention that it's far too likely to start a revolution (or in your case, re-start one :-).

And yet, despite the very convincing scenario of complete meltdown painted by FOA and Another, I still find myself clinging to the hope that the supply/demand cycle will re-assert itself as has happened in other industries (the recent history of the airline industry being my beacon in the darkness).

I would never touch futures or their derivatives even under normal market conditions, but a small stock investment in the most efficient, best established global mining companies seems to me still to be worth the risk (note again my use of the word "small"). Whether those shares are ultimately sold for Euros instead of dollars, I still am optimistic enough to wager that they will indeed trade on some market for some price in some currency. In any event, though, I plan to keep an eye on potential warning signs that such optimism may be about to be dashed.

So where will we find a "real" price of gold amidst the make-believe? Clearly neither Spot POG nor futures POG will be realistic during a full-blown emergency, nor will the share prices of gold mining stocks. Of course, if I find myself still in possession of such papers during an emergency, their official resale value will be all too real to me.

Even under normal market conditions, the paper price of gold is not the perfect guide because it is determined by constant repetitions of FOA's analogy of the two neighbours betting over the fence. Perhaps one in a thousand participants in the daily setting of the official prices of gold plans to acquire or deliver physical gold. The other 999 participants are merely there to bet on it and claim their winnings in some other currency.

Put another way, how many people at a racetrack are attempting to buy a horse? If you want to know the going price of a physical horse, don't look to a racetrack for answers. And don't assume that being a partial owner in a horse farm (thanks FOA) in any way assures you of being able to own a physical horse at some future date.

Likewise, if you want to know the going price of physical gold, don't look to the paper chase, most especially during any sort of financial emergency when paper-related numbers will become very distorted. Frankly, even though the emergency has yet to be publicly declared, things in that arena are already becoming increasingly distorted.

Most of us here at the USAGOLD Forum do not buy and sell thousands of ounces at once, and most of us take immediate possession of our purchases. From that, it's clear where we should look to find the price of physical gold which is most appropriate for our activities: in fact, our very conversations here are being hosted by someone who spends most of his waking hours discovering that price.

--------------
Street POG
--------------

The Cash or Street price of gold is the number of dollars (or pounds, or euros) you take out of your wallet and hand to your friendly, neighbourhood coin dealer in return for a one-ounce Krugerrand.

Why a Krugerrand? Because it's the least numismatic, most commonly encountered, least lovely form of gold. It has no numismatic premium and no jewellery premium and no patriotic premium. It's even less attractive than a one-ounce JM bar.

That makes the Krugerrand the perfect unit of measure for Street POG. Its only special quality is that it contains exactly one ounce of gold (mixed with much too much copper).

The only circumstance which would disqualify the Krugerrand would be if suddenly coin dealers were willing to sell Maple Leaves or Eagles for less than Krugerrands. But to deal with that case, let us define Street POG as the price of the cheapest one-ounce coin or wafer available for sale at that moment.

You will know that the governmentally influenced markets are becoming highly distorted when you see a Krugerrand selling on the street for significantly more dollars than the Spot POG quoted by the paper markets that day.

A Krugerrand will always have a little premium built into its price (hi, I just bought these coins and I'd like to sell them to you without making any profit at all on the sale... my, that would be daft).

At some point in August 1999 when Spot POG was quoted at $260, I bought a single Krugerrand for $268. That's within the range of normality. We're not in uncharted waters yet.

But let's say that Spot POG drops to $200 (sadly still not out of the question even with the September 1999 rise in POG towards $270). What will a Krugerrand cost on the street then? If Spot POG drops no more abruptly than has been its wont in recent months, there's a decent chance Michael and his fellow coin dealers might then be able to profitably sell Krugerrands for $205 each. In that case, the shorts and the financial ministers are still in control.

But if you see Spot POG drop below $200 while a Krugerrand selling on the street never falls below $230-$240 ... or if you see Spot POG remain at $256 yet Krugerrands leap to $300 and Eagles to $310 ... hello new gold market. That would be a clarion call that things are starting to become seriously distorted.

The American Civil War
--------------

I think maybe the hardest mental hurdle for people to clear in understanding Another and FOA is this notion of two gold markets occurring simultaneously. There's an historical example (and it's Western :-) in which very much the same thing transpired...

In 1864, the USA and the CSA were reaching something of a stalemate in their war. Contrary to what most Americans learn today in (the winner's) school system, had but a very few decisions been made differently, the Confederacy would have won.

This, by the way, is why we see so many Americans (descended from both sides) re-enact Civil War battles over and over. How often (except on Monty Python) have you seen re-enactments of Pearl Harbour? The only battles worth replaying are the ones that could have gone either way.

In any event, to the average person living in Either the USA or CSA in 1864, the near term future was incredibly unclear and terrifying.

In the pre-war USA, national government funding was handled by the levying of import/export duties. The IRS was not yet a glimmer in politicians' eyes. For a nation at peace, duties provided sufficient income to run a minimalist national government.

In time of war, however, expenses magnify dramatically. Both the remnant USA and the new CSA needed to acquire vast funding very rapidly to raise an effective military. The both of them did so in the time honoured way: they borrowed the money. Have a peek at Lincoln greenbacks and Confederate paper money sometime. They are promises to pay the bearer with gold and/or silver at some significant time following the cessation of hostilities.

These documents were by no means the equivalent of today's Federal Reserve Notes (try redeeming a $20 FRN for a St. Gaudens sometime). No, Civil War paper banknotes were the equivalent of today's Gold Futures Contracts.

Oh, Lincoln greenbacks and Confederate dollars passed from wallet to wallet during the Civil War years as if they were currency, and in the first year or so they were regarded as 1-for-1 equivalents of coin. But as 1864 drew nearer, something odd began to happen.

"Howdy, I'd like to hand you this crisp $1 greenback in return for ten silver dimes change."

"I'll give you 8 silver dimes for a paper dollar, not a penny more."

Realise that this happened in the North, in the remnant USA. It happened too in the Confederacy, but modern people remember it there only in association with the final default on paper which happened when the CSA government was extinguished.

But the sole difference between a Confederate dollar and a Lincoln greenback was that one paper issuer was still in existence in 1866 and one was not. In 1864, no one could confidently say that either government would still be there a mere two years hence.

Notice that, in this regard, not much has changed since then. In 1933 for US citizens, then in 1971 for the rest of us, the USA government voided its obligation to pay gold for paper dollars.

If you hand me silver or gold, I won't care whether the symbols impressed on it are from a reliable government, an unreliable one, or a defunct one. But if you hand me paper, I'd better be firmly assured the issuer will live long enough (and be inclined) to pay off this debt to me. Even if you hand me a paper claim ticket to silver or gold stored in a vault somewhere, I'd better be firmly assured the vault keeper is of a mind to let me take possession of that metal without the slightest hesitation.

Another and FOA, by saying wise people should avoid paper and only hold physical, are indicating that they expect the LBMA and Comex Gold Contract documents will go the way of the Confederate Dollar (or maybe more appropriately, the way of the pre-1933 paper dollar: "Yes, a dollar is still a dollar, we just won't live up to it in quite the way we used.").

At the very least, they're saying the risk of such a systemic change is so substantial that one should not be standing too near the fault line should the quake come sooner than predicted.

What the both of them are describing is an official Spot POG (and its kindred future months' POGs) which may well plummet to $200 or even, as Another allowed some time ago, perhaps $10. Realise, though, that Another is by no means predicting that Michael will be able to profitably sell Krugerrands at $10 each. Far from it.

What Another and FOA are anticipating is a situation much like the paper money situation in both the USA and the CSA in 1864: how likely is it that the paper contract you're handing me today will be redeemable for any amount of gold by this time next year?

Tell you what, I've got a spare ten bob I feel no desperate attachment to. I'll buy your one-ounce IOU just for kicks. If LBMA completely expires, I'm out only a small amount. If LBMA unaccountably fails to expire, I've struck it rich. Of course, I may still not receive a physical ounce of gold on settlement day. I may find I've become the proud owner of a 1/400th part of a London Good Delivery bar, which I'm then told may not be removed from the vault. If I'm lucky, I might be able to sell my claim ticket for some amount of whatever paper currency is still worth accepting.

Meanwhile, those of us with less of a gambling inclination will sleep more soundly holding physical. After all, a silver or gold coin firmly in your possession remains silver or gold even after its issuer expires.

Yours,
I.V. Holtzman

To ALL:
When a person tries to protect their assets against the effects of fiat money, what are they really fighting against? The first inclination is to say "rising prices". Yet, it's much more than that! Most everyone agrees that interest in the bank never covers the loss of buying power brought on by price inflation. Especially the "after tax" return. It's the same old story, played out decade after decade. We must "invest our savings" (or become a day trader?) because the money will erode in value! Even at 3%, price inflation can eat away at any cash equivalents.

But, price inflation isn't the only story that impacts us. Rising prices come and go, but money inflation continues to effect us without fail. So why do people feel better when price increases slow or stop, even as money inflation runs ever upward? The good feelings usually evolve from the
effects that money inflation (increases in the money supply) has on financial instruments. These assets take on the very same characteristic that the rising prices of goods once exhibited. They run up in currency price.

During these periods of "less goods inflation" another sinister form of mind set lurks in the shadows. Credibility inflation! Yes, it has been here many times before as every fiat currency alternates it's effects upon the feelings of the populous.

Fiat currencies must, by definition always expand in quantity. Their continued usage and acceptance is always obtained with the bribe of "more wealth to come"! Without that bribe, humans would never fall for holding a debt to receive the same goods in the future if they could get
the real thing today. Human nature has always dictated that we buy what we need now instead of holding someone's IOU to receive it later. That nature is only changed through the "greed to obtain more". Like this: "I'll hold my wealth in dollars currency if my assets are going up. Later those
increased assets will buy me a better lifestyle as I purchase more goods and services than I could buy before".

This is the hidden dynamic we see today and the exact antithesis of the past price inflation's. Just as destructive as "goods price increases", "credibility inflation" impacts our emotions to "hold on for the future", more is coming! In every way, "credibility inflation" is just as much a product of an increase in the money stock as "regular price inflation is. As cash money streams out to cover any and all financial failures, we begin to attach an ever high credibility to the continued function of the fiat system. In effect, the more money that is printed, the higher we price the credibility factor.

Onward:

ORO, the GDP is one of the great deceivers in the Fiat money world. During the last century (??) or so, some form of GDP has always been used to measure the great mass of human endeavours. Yet, through out this time, some form of fiat currency has always been in effect. Even during the Gold standard, fractional reserve banking expanded "gold note money" more so than the "gold money in existence. Prior to 1929 this effect, if not creating outright "price inflation" during a time of Gold standard policy, was creating "credibility inflation" in the minds of investors. Using the backdrop of a growing GDP, people brought into inflating financial assets and ignored these signals as evidence that the fractional currency system was failing. Even though the dollar contained a policy statement to supply gold, back then a gold loan was still only good until everyone asked for gold.

The same thing is happening today. People destroy the currency structure by thinking it can deliver more than reality will allow. Instead of all debt failing slowly with each upward march of price inflation, prolonged "credibility inflation" snaps all at once as investors try to suddenly revert to a "buy now mentality". The inability of government authorities to contain the fiction of "good debt" is usually the feature behind the investor mood change. A currency run induced by an IMF stalemate would qualify as just such a function change. The "snap back" into a sudden "real price inflation situation" caused during this stage by a currency failure always breaks the whole structure. We approach this end today!
Further:
The GDP has been the relative gauge to mark all other measurements against. Even so it's numbers reflect little more that the result of an "expanding fiat money supply". Yes, there have been recorded downturns in GDP, but these contractions would have been worse if measured in real
(gold) money. In opposite fashion, expansions paint a much brighter picture as all financial liabilities seem less a threat if held against a rising GDP. I submit that the GDP figures offer little more than a way to entice investors to increase their "credibility image" of our monetary system. Fiat moneys are always on a long term upward expansion, and they can hardly do less than bloat the picture.
Someone I know said; "your wealth is not what your money say it is"!


What should we be looking at to see the real picture? Be back a few hours from now.

ALL:
When it comes to silver, I agree with all of you. But then "along comes reality"! Many of the current analysts persist with their analogy that "silver is used to make change and small transactions". A concept I completely agree with, only if we sink to that point? The valuations placed on silver will mostly be established by the kind of "currency turmoil" we experience.

Look at today's US paper currency. It's all dollars and yet $100 bills are used readily right along side $1.00 bills. It seems that we found a way to create ever smaller denominations of dollars to satisfy the demand for making change. I don't see anyone carrying around Canadian currency for the small purchases a US $100 would not work for.

My point is that gold has in the past and will again in the future be broken down, "if needed", into alloyed coins for the very smallest of transactions. One can easily carry a one gram gold coin that is made the size of a quarter. Even a 1/10 gram will do the trick. As Mr. Gresham points out, someone will always be around to create money change. Be it in silver or gold, the most efficient money will rule the day. In the worst of war like conditions, paper money is traded. German marks were spent as the booms fell!

My question of which is more affordable $100 in gold or $100 in silver? A poor man will accept and use either that is offered, no contest.

Again, the future demand for "Metal money" will be established by "how the currency markets evolve". I believe (and have written on this before) that through out all that is to come, US dollars will continue to circulate as will most all the established currencies today. "Come what may", we will use them for whatever value and efficiency they will offer. Just as the much lesser moneys of the world presently circulate, while their citizens hold dollars, gold and silver, so too will we act in a similar fashion.

The question for our immediate future is in what form will you hold metal money to represent the "bulk" of your tradable wealth? As all the currency and economic turmoil swirl around us, the pressure will be to not only hold reserves that will not be at risk, but hold them in the largest "tradable form". Gold and it's high future price will certainly fit that bill. Again, contrary to what
many think, when the dollar falls off the reserve currency tower, most everyone will still be getting paid in dollars. Yes, they will be greatly devalued from price inflation, but buying your gas with dollars will still be a weekly chore.

The future will see the Euro currency as the value reserve all other currencies will trade off of. Beside it will trade a "free gold" market denominated in Euros. The implications of this will be for US nationals to continue using dollars while holding gold (or Euros?) for a bulk, risk free tradable reserve. One can see that in this picture, the purpose for silver is greatly diminished, no?

Got silver? Don't need it, cause I got gold!

We shall see, back in an hour or so. FOA

Hello Gold Dancer,
I think I paralleled some parts of your thinking. Thanks for offering your reasoning.


Goldspoon (9/25/99; 15:37:33MDT - Msg ID:14370)
Some have suggested confiscation....possibly. --

Goldspoon,
I think the confiscation item has always been blown completely out of proportion. Some even go as far as saying that there is no use in holding gold if it gains a lot because it will be taken away from you. Then in the same context, it's offered to buy gold stocks to gain from a more reasonable increase in the gold price! In addition, for the same reasons they see silver as an item that will not be touched. One has but to review "Holtzman's "More Than One POG" #14297" to get what is his beautiful rational and reasonable retake on what confiscation would really mean:

--------If during an emergency the U.S. government were to declare Spot POG to be $50, and if Homestake Mining were to begin selling gold privately at a higher Street POG, the U.S. government could very easily make life unpleasant for Homestake.

By contrast, the government would have a much more difficult time coming after you and the handful of gold coins you've anonymously buried in your back yard. Most likely, they simply wouldn't attempt it. A wise politician never frightens his citizens too much, most particularly during
emergencies. A government can achieve its goals by oppressing the majority owners (few in number) of a desired commodity while graciously allowing the minority owners (vast in number) to retain their property.

The confiscation in the U.S. in 1933 was along such lines: the government's intent was to take direct possession of the vast majority of gold within U.S. borders (common gold coins) by pulling them out of circulation, yet not overtly injure citizens who had sentimental or numismatic
attachments to specific coins. There weren't any jack-booted thugs banging on Americans' doors after midnight in search of every last gold coin, and I can't imagine any present or future administration doing so either. It's far too expensive to be worthwhile... not to mention that it's far
too likely to start a revolution (or in your case, re-start one :-).-----------------------

Thanks Holtzman, incredible job!

Again, if you think silver is going up because of currency turmoil, is it reasonable to believe it will
increase as it did during the 70s style Hunt fiasco? I'm not sure that event wasn't but a one of a kind move. Everyone considers that performance (the only one we have had ) as an example of how silver moves when gold goes up. However, it's entirely possible that that gold move was but a minor side show and in the future gold will dwarf any percentage rise in silver. We didn't know silver could move like that until it happened and we may find that few will understand how gold can outperform everything in the future. As I offered earlier, the coming currency transition may render the "many present reasons" for holding more silver than gold useless. Especially if currency stays in circulation as the demand for industrial silver falls from a economic contraction. If such is the case, the percentage move will fail to match gold.

I know many own silver. I offer this as a balance observation. Good luck to all of us, may we all win! FOA

Do you think silver is worth holding as a commodity, the way you would hold platinum? Don't you think the prices will go very high as silver reserves as depleted? Or do you think gold will rise the highest?

Hello Leigh,
All of the investment attributes for these metals are conflicting. On a commodity basis, silver would be the best. Warren B. brought it in his company name expressly for it's industrial prospects. He views it in the same light as a stock investment. I doubt he took it for any of it's monetary reasons.
Again, invest to make a return. Take your best shot. But for today buy gold to preserve what you have during a global dislocation of currency systems. Because the future may play out as I have outlined, gold will out perform (on a real basis) most any past investment made during the last 30
years. Not because it's a good investment with great prospect demand, but because it will again perform it's ages old function as the worlds money. Something it hasn't done in stand alone fashion for perhaps 60 years?????? That return to money use in this modern world is the attraction that drew in the Giants, in whose footsteps physical gold owners now walk. The rise will make most people feel very foolish not to have purchased at $1,000 while it was cheap (smile)! We shall see.

Thank you and good day FOA

Point 1)
If my above interpretation of your suggestions is correct and the events play out as you see them then with further thought I may comes to agree with your remarks regarding silver.

Hello Twice D,
There is actually quite a large group of people that see things this way. Nothing is written because they are very private.

--Point 2) If we move to an environment where bartering becomes the standard, then I would still think silver would be appropriate in some degree because of the smaller value associated with it. I would also ask who I would trust to take my .1867 oz Napolean III and melt it down into a 1 gram
gold coin – definitely not the government, I would never see it again. I would also be skeptical of any other organization given that history shows us examples of "shaving" whereby the gold content of coins was reduced.------

Aragorn III (9/26/99; 2:53:37MDT - Msg ID:14408)

Hello Aragorn,
Nice application of clear logic! Let me see it I have this right for a future context:

"Get your scrap iron now because gold and silver have already run up in price. Iron is the only affordable metal for late buyers. You get many more ounces per purchase because the gold / silver / iron ratio is so far in the favour of iron. When the teaming masses can no longer afford "real money" they will most certainly buy iron in 1/10 ounce form to use for small purchases"

I expanded your post with my slanted view to drive home a point to others. From the time that silver ran in the 70s, on one ever had any historical precedent that it could move so much. Yet, from 1980 on, every silver promoter has used the Hunt squeeze as the basis that it will rise again in just such a fashion. It has been the ideal "leveraged sell" for every boiler room to sucker in paper traders. I bet
there are many who have lost the most money by taking on silver as a leveraged play.

I say all of this as the proud owner of some silver! Just as Aristotle (and yourself at other times) pointed out, in a complete "currency: breakdown, silver will be needed and used. Yet, in this modern day and age, ironically, inflated fiat currencies will most likely continue to be used for most purchases. I bet CMAX could add some light on this as he is in an "inflating country"!

Further: During the runup in gold during the late 70s, the governments were selling gold all the way up. In the same light as we look at the YEN today, gold buyers were always afraid of the "next" intervention. Yet, even with the official gold sales, gold soared. During that time silver was never the application of any widespread major sales. Today, we must consider the effects on gold that a major 'Official" policy change would do. While everyone is waiting for the next big sale, others are anticipating the total withdrawal of government selling/ leasing from the markets. Indeed, if the ECB or oil or china start buying official stocks through the BIS, the results will be the reverse
of the 70s markets. "Street gold" will be the percentage out performer!

We must bear in mind that there will be a big difference between Official BIS buying through the CBs as opposed to them buying paper gold on the LBMA. I think Mr. Holtsmans "More Than One POG" #14297 will be a hated factor for many current gold mine owners for years to come. With BIS buying from all CBs, the supply of gold will collapse, forcing the "street price" through the roof. Falling demand (buying) for paper gold will drive those securities to the floor because of their inability to secure and deliver enough physical gold. This dynamic will absolutely force the IMF/
dollar governments to lock the trading price of paper gold at below most production costs until new mine supplies can work off some of the paper commitments. Even though cash settlement (at the locked price) will be used, it will cover but a fraction of the outstanding paper. Counter party
default will rule the day. No doubt, the majority of the mines in operation today will close, thereby forcing an extended workout period.

It's a simple choose of what is more important to the majority of people? Save the major portion of the banking system whose menders are the who's who of the LBMA, OR save the worlds gold mines? No contest!!
This is where we will see competitive revaluation's upward of IMF and existing CB gold stocks. These source of new equity will be needed to cover aid to failing countries
(some from shut down gold mines) and back the massive loses a collapse of the dollar reserve currency will bring.

For years everyone looked for the nations to block any large rise in gold, so they invested in assets that would benefit from what would be perceived as a reasonable gold
increase. One that the governments would begrudgingly allow. Of course we think of Gold stocks. Yet few considered the true ramifications if countries suddenly revalue gold not as money, but as a world reserve asset! We approach this dynamic today as world dollar debt has reached it's limit. Exciting times for those that "walk in the footsteps of giants", awful times for those that have invested in the gold industry. It's not to late to change course and sail with the wind. With the direction of someone that understands, I have done just that!

With the wind...........we are on the road now!!! FOA

Questions for FOA

------------When you and Mr. Holtzman talk about a black market for gold, do you mean an illegal black market? ----

Hello Leigh,
If I answer for both Mr. H and myself, it may get him riled up enough for him to post more of those great works. So I'm going to do it this one time! (smile) Also, it will be best to stay in close contact with Michael Kosares, as he will know the very first changes in the markets (if they occur).

However, in my view: I bet we end up with a very strong "dealer market" with companies like Centennial Precious Metals in the forefront. The difference will be in that they will price their product based on the real investor supply and demand as these dealers trade among themselves. Yes, an official gold market will be in effect, but "street gold" will will carry a huge premium over the official "trading price". A premium that will not be profit for the dealers, rather a reflection of the true price of gold.
(TownCrier, you had a great explanation of this somewhere, no?)
Over time most dealers will slowly disregard all paper trading. The present major banking houses that trade
bullion and paper will most likely drift far away from the gold business if their loses in that arena build. So; It won't be a black market like in the movies. That will only come about if things "really get out of hand". Something I doubt will happen, even during a Y2K breakdown.

----Do you think it is possible transactions in gold will be outlawed? That wouldn't do our government any good,would it? -----

Outlawed? No possible way! The thing everyone forgets is that during the 1930 gold call in, the governments were trying to place gold in a tight price range. They still had a good dollar system and wanted to keep it for the worlds sake. Today, the problem is different in that they have created so much dollar based debt that it can't be serviced any more without a blowing up the world reserve money supply and hence the system. The US knows it's over and must accept a partial defeat. To accomplish this, in opposite fashion from the 30s they must raise the price of gold, not keep it
down.

It works like this: To keep the gold price stable you have to get your hands on more of it. Then use that physical to balance existing dollar claims (as in the thirties) or sell it into the marketplace (as in the last 20+ years). For today; To make the price rise, you don't need more physical to use as supply, you simply withdraw supply from the marketplace and revalue what you have.

The US treasury has some 8,000 tonnes ++/--. They can't back the same dollar with gold that they removed from the gold standard in 71. Major legal problems there (BIS???). Nor can they create a new dollar with the Euro on their backs. They can follow the ECB and the IMF lead and begin to revalue the existing US gold stock to use as equity against the massive reserve loses that are coming. No it won't cover even half the liability (even if it's over $10,000), but it's the only fallback asset any nation has. It will prevent a total World and US contraction.

The trading and owning of "street gold" by the US public will be encouraged, not outlawed. Any demand that raises the gold price further will be welcomed as a "new concept" to save a contracting economy. This was the real reason the Gold Eagle program was started in the first place! Political bases covered when the time comes.

---Wouldn't they want us to spend our gold so that eventually they could get their paws on it?---

No Leigh, in the future they will ask you to spend "your" gold, but not for their accumulation. They have plenty of gold and will just devalue the dollar further by raising the gold price in stair step fashion. Your spending will be to build the economy again. In reality, you will be selling some gold to a dealer for depreciated dollars. Then spend those dollars internally, within the country.

Gold coin sales will be a hard act to follow as we cross this valley of money transition. Mine owners will be screaming for controls of the street price so they can sell into the defunct LBMA at a higher price. It won't happen. Later, everyone will be glad they brought physical while the going seemed rough. Needless it's going to be interesting as this all unfolds. Eventually, paper gold will be out of the way (covered) and a real "mining boom will ensue". That's when we sell some of our gold to buy gold mine stocks! (big smile)
Get ready for that time............buy gold now!

Silver and gold - relative appreciation - a theory

-----If silver goes to $10 per oz you just doubled your money i.e. now you have $10,000 (1,000 oz times $10). That other $5,000 you put into gold for 20 oz will need to go $500 per oz i.e. 20 times $500 = $10,000.) Elementary my dear Watson.-----------

Mr. Koan,
Watson wants to know why gold can't double at the same time that silver doubles?

He still want's to know why a poor man will buy $100 worth of silver before he'll buy $100 worth of gold?

Does that also mean he will buy ten pounds of dirt for a $1.00 first, if one pound of sand is also
selling for a $1.00? Hmmmmm!

I have a few dumb friends but they are not stupid. Seems the most "dumb" among them always understand the relative worth theory better than most any PHD scientist. I also know I'm smarter than they are, even if they have more money than me? (smile)

C Man,
That was a good one!
One of the reasons I advocated buying Goldfield stock was to support their actions. I Know most didn't understand, but burning a property deed (or stock certificate) in some cultures is synonymous with stating "you will never sell the investment".

Here, this company does an industry supporting move and no one (even GATA) advocates investing in that company for their strong anti gold selling stance. Instead people see what happened and went out and brought ABX (or as much)? This Goldfield action was the major catalyst that sparked new interest in the gold arena. It called into attention the delicate nature of the paper gold position if physical is taken out. If everyone starts charging the auctions, this paper gold market will close in a hurry!

Goldfield buys and everyone comes out of the woodwork to proclaim a new bull market for reasons other than what happened. Then they direct new buyers into more paper gold investments, regardless of weather they are controlled "shorters" for the BBs. The Goldfield action clearly stated
that they alone (along with Anglo) are independent from the paper control. I support management that take "right minded stands" weather my investment will pay off or not!
Chicken Man, watch this market run for another ten or twenty and see what happens to it! With the G7 fiasco concluded, we may get a blow-out this week!

Why did they do it? Why do the Europeans want the price of gold to rise? Why didn't the U.S. and Britain stand in their way?

Michael,
That's a good one. I think they are following the rough outline we have talked about. If you have absorbed most of TownC's (Europe) news today, several things come to mind.
1. England is doing what Another thought, moving from the dollar system into the Euro world. Let's face it, they are "lost" in their current position if the US economy contracts and Euroland grows internally. Europe has made it clear on several occasions (including today) that they are a closed
system. Yes, the world can trade with them, but the conditions are better on the inside. England no longer has the same ties to America that their political dogma suggests. Every day Europe more becomes their family through proximity, if nothing else. Hey, the Euro tunnel may have been a bad investment, but it has finally tied the isles physically to the mainland!

Their push for EMU is right in line with their completion of bullion sales. Don't read their sales as
a reserve balancing act, like Belgium. The BOE is indeed trying to clear out some bad paper before their move. Like it or not, when England, Swiss and the middle east all tie to Euroland (through EMU or by trade), the LBMA will become redundant. I bet in five years or less (mostly much less)
the ECB will sanction a major bullion association of it's own. The time frame here is much too short for the LBMA to clear out the paper it took them a decade to build up supporting the dollar.

2. How can the US stand in the way of rising gold? It's only been the (needed) continued use of dollar that constructed the "Low Gold" paper markets for oil. The US mostly used it's currency powers to augment the plan as others carried it out. Now with the successful birth of the Euro, many other nations are scrambling to at least build a backup bridge into that arena. The US is not blind to this and will certainly not commit it's gold reserves to buy in it's own currency debt from it's competitors. If someone is about to kill you, you don't offer to pay back your debt to them before they act!

Neither do I think the Fed (or treasury) has been trading paper gold. If the right entities wanted to expose this (the US is very open in these regards) they would get their hands on those items and exercise them in a very visible way. One that followed the paper trail with the media in tow. Weather the FED brought gold to fill the order or used Fort Knox, it could be seen. Besides, with Congress so obsesses with not letting our gold flow into other hands (or however the IMF deal works out), one whiff of Fed gold commitments would blow the whole story.

3. The ECB announcement was used to close the final door, in public view. They now have the Swiss and English on their side and it's time for gold to become Euro Money. Let's see if the ECB / BIS don't eventually arrange for the purchase of most of that gold. Goldfield and Anglo may eventually have some big bidding competitors the next time around. No hedge funds allowed next time. This last auction was done with the full knowledge of this ECB announcement in the
background. No wonder the bidding was over subscribed just in the last minute.

The US stood quiet to this dollar killing move because they now need gold to rise also. This concept was quietly circulated around Washington this past spring. Now with this new ECB move, you can bet that the IMF is going to lose it's funding (from everyone) on a systematic schedule. IMF gold will be the only equity the US will have to continue supporting the international dollar debt (and therefore the integrity of the dollar) for the time being. Note: Did they lob off of the term "FUND" from the IMF name because funding is being phased out? (don't laugh, Washington is
nuts)

I look for the US economy to drag down Japan, Canada, Mexico and all of our major trade partners as foreign dollar debt slowly fails. India, the Middle East and China will all create a new "Orient Express" trade route with their old European partners.

Golden Sun is some stud, right? I know you are having fun, good stuff my friend. I bet KOAN could kill me for my luck. Here I grind on silver all day long and Gold supports my words almost as if I knew what was going to happen. (smile) Bet silver goes up a dollar tomorrow in good faith for the Silver Kings!

Looks like everyone made a tonne of money on gold stocks! Good for all!! Even my Goldfield went up! (I hate it when it does that!)(smile). Me and the "Bullion Boys" at USAGOLD FORUM will just have to settle for our little 5%.

Make what you can because the game is all over, people! If you are happy holding after tax profits from the mine shares, that's good. But, physical is going "shortage" big time now. Bet there is major 5 and 10 tonne order flow through the BIS right now and it's looking for 30 day full
allocation. If it doesn't hit the CBs desk for filling, the scramble is on. So, during the next many weeks or few months, your profits won't find much "physical street gold" around at a price you're willing pay. Indeed, the paper gold price we all follow may crunch down hard as this unfolds. Buy it if you think it's the same equivalent, I know it isn't. Lot to think about, no?

PH, yes, we are on the road!
I can't wait to see how those 400,000+/- gold options work the Comex price with no gold in the warehouse! I heard they will be serving "Bear Steaks" for lunch on the trading floor!. Later, everyone's beef is going to burn!

Another, my friend,
I have missed our discussions in recent months as it seems that you and I, both, have been occupied elsewhere. Much has changed since our last exchange(s). I sense that our friends at the central banks have begun to worry about their outstanding gold, as should the private lenders. The Dutch central bank felt it necessary to call off the dogs by saying they are no longer an easy mark. And now Japan tells us that they will buy if the IMF should want to sell -- a gold poor island nation in the East with too many dollars and no longer enough time. So is lending gold at 4% a good deal? Or should we consider anything we lend at that price, "lost assets"?........Is the golden intention floated by Japan today as important as I think it is, or something to be discounted? I remember your words of wisdom on England...a lost land. I remember your words warning us of the state of the LBMA which is now so apparent. What next? my good friend. Is this "a night to think about gold?" What say you about Japan and Europe and the future of gold?

Mr. Kosares, we speak again. This gold market, it be not as before, yes? For six years and a time, we build the "alliance". Now all join and say "no more" unfair currency. This day I stand with Europe on ground that is stable for the future of our children. Ground made hard with gold that
moves "no more"! Your dollar will now fight the "good battle" on it's own. From early this year it finds no support from "cheap oil". Soon it will find no support from "oil settlement".
Without the "good backing" that comes with others "holding dollars", the world must now settle dollars in a true gold price. It is time, gold again becomes the money our fathers knew. It's dollar price will run now. Fear this as the banker is afraid of his creditors, for it now runs long my friend and stops only for the destruction of its market. From the days of our youth we see not again a
market such as this. All will soon race for the bullion metal and few will walk away with gold. Your mind does consider the "right number" for gold yes? I say, add that ten times and this you will pay if one waits.
Japan? With no trade how will a nation supply its oil? The oil that built them does now break them. Buy gold we say, years ago, hear us they did not. The yen eyes and ears always face across the pacific. Even as their future was thru Hong Kong to Europe. Now this yen will fail a nation that forgot how it's sun still sets at their backs.
Sir, the bullion in the many thousands will change the common landscape of your land to as rocks and bushes. It will also grow the most green lawn for holders of Euros.

May many flowers present your home in the good light of old wealth. The old wealth that we find in the new value of gold!

Thank You Another

Goldspoon,

What a day it was! The "Bullion Boys" at USAGOLD Forum got to march at the front of the victory parade. How about that Golden sun? It's a triple crown winner again! Up over 8% while the other metal horses had to eat his dust. Even most of the major gold mines went up, but are still out on the track coming in as stragglers (except for Goldfields, up about 17%) (I hate it when my only little mine investment goes up) (very bad for credibility) (smile). Somehow I think this is a bad precedent to start doing this. I'll stop while ahead.

We can be sure that some Bullion houses are now the proud owner of defaulted gold paper. More of it will come pilling in through out this week. This is just the beginning, because this house of cards just collapsed. For a while there (back in the summer), it looked like the ECB was just going to let the dollar / IMF slowly flood itself with gold paper until the market failed. Truly, the only way
to make it more valuable, was to sell more of it and make the paper price fall. Now, they pulled the plug on them and will let the market eat itself. Make no mistake, this is no too way trading market! It's going to run until someone big fails and shuts it down. We don't just work out thousands of
tonnes of short gold positions with a few days and $50 up. I think the gold shares see this and are trying to realistically price in what several locked limit days will do to the infrastructure. Yes, everyone is hedged and covered, but this little move has most likely cleaned out the present counterparties equity already. If the dow, bonds and dollar start selling off big, they (funds) have run out of money and are selling for more. More cash will bring waves of paper selling on comex. Yet, the very equity selling that raises the funds for those waves will bring even more loses to the hedge funds. They used the old gold financing to buy what will be sold now. So look for intraday
waves of more exaggerated form than today's +44 move. Still, all in all, if the banks or the Fed can stand it, this market will run through 500 or 600 on this first kill off.

I'm standing here and watching all this with no risk assets. For me it's all very interesting. As for the bears being cut into bar - B - Q stakes, they can't lose what they never had. Most of the US paper game is all in ones mind anyway. I have a mountain of notes to cover, so I'll step away.

Why did it stop?

It didn't!

Part of the process of buying "real gold" is in the waiting for allocation. Be it actual delivery of metal, receipt of certificates for "real vault deposit" or just clearing out the cash settlement of trades gone bad. This all takes time, especially when such a large segment of the
market has just been "cleaned out" financially. On the surface, new traders continue to put up their $2,000 or so of margin money and trade the Comex for some paper cash. Underneath it all, a mad scramble is going on to find gold to meet all the failed commitments. For many of the major trade houses (and BBs), they now must use their own capital to carry the dead positions of others. Most of them will (or already have) covered their financial (read that cash) positions in the paper markets. However, they must still process the real nature of the trade, "find new real gold to
replace what was lent". Like this: "We sold the gold and lent the money to a fund to trade with. If that fund cannot put up more capital to back the loan (because the price of gold has gone so far against him), and pay the higher rental rate (now in effect) when his 1 to 6 month loan comes due;
We will attach his assets and sell them off to buy the gold back ourselves."

This whole cat and mouse game can take a while as everyone sweats the outcome. Right now, many of those funds are so far under water on their "financial trades" (example: short Yen at 125), that a sell off of their "book" leaves little. SO, the bank has to borrow gold against it's own capital and pay the new "lease rate" as it "fully allocates" (returns) the gold position to the lender (mostly private entities). The gold owner (and lender) cannot and will not just sit there and watch the collateral (the trading book of the hedge fund) for the loan go up in smoke. Especially if the lease rate is skyrocketing from an "obvious major world shortage of gold"! Even if the bank is successful in borrowing gold, they still must one day buy in the open market to refund the second gold loan. They can go round and round, borrowing gold to replace the "last" deal. All the while driving the lending rate higher and higher as more and more lenders back out at any lease rate offered.

The LBMA statement about high lease rates bring out new gold for leasing is flawed. Often 20% (and higher) currency rates in failing third world counties does not bring in any new private capital. Usually government money is needed. In like view, we see how the ECB has now blocked new official gold to support a market that private lenders are now running from. It's like the US saying:

"we will no longer back the Mexican treasury market and the private sector will have to do it".

All of this takes time as it slowly unwinds (fails). Without major official gold supplies, this gold market is going to grind to a complete halt. The day traders (that currently run in and out) will one day find the entire system "force major" and their margins frozen. Of course, they will be settled in cash, but only after the "street gold" price runs into the many thousands.

With this in view, do we now see why "taking delivery" of each and every ounce (just like GS and ML are doing on Comex) is so important. Your "big" paper gains from settled cash trades (and mining shares), that will look "oh so huge", will be almost nothing to buy gold with after the turn.

In fact, they may unload a paper selling spree on the markets, that crunches the price down, "just before it completely locks up"!!!

Think about it? Then: Think about how your assets will hold up?

Got the view of what is ahead?

Further!
All:
I'm doing this in a big rush, so in the last post,

Force Major = Force Majeure = can't honour commitments

Also, Even if the Russian gold is lent, it only creates a liability to Russia and another gold loan in the future will be needed to repay that loan. Through out history, panics are created when people run from lending assets for the purpose of covering someone else's loses. Usually, exposure, is what brings on the run. The ECB has just exposed the system. The run has begun.

September 27, 1999. Shades of de Gaulle: The New, New World of Gold

By its stunning announcement Sunday evening, the new European Central Bank served notice that it will not tolerate politically motivated Anglo-American interference in the gold market, and that the Bank of England is now on probation as the central bank with principal responsibility for overseeing this important market. The details of the announcement have received full coverage by the financial press and wire services. Only time will reveal its full significance. But what already seems clear is that not since
Charles de Gaulle and the Banque de France mounted the Franco-American gold war in the 1960's has a European central bank so directly confronted Anglo-American hegemony over the international monetary system. And this time it is not merely a European central bank, but the European Central Bank.

The classical international gold standard became an unintended casualty of the First World War. Ever since, first the British and then the Americans have essentially dictated the basic features of the world monetary system: the gold exchange standard after World
War I, Bretton Woods after World War II, and floating rates after Viet Nam. Each time the new system finally led to an unprecedented credit expansion and an equally unprecedented bull market in stocks. But the process of unwinding the great bull markets of the 1920's and the 1960's brought down the very international monetary systems that spawned them. The final outcome of floating exchange rates and the great bull market of the 1990's is yet to be written. However, the advent of the Euro was intended to make Europe what perhaps no single European country could be: a necessary player in any future fundamental restructuring of the international monetary system.

For now, the gold market itself may provide sufficient fireworks. One-year lease rates today hit 4.7% as existing shorts scrambled to secure adequate borrowings. Under the circumstances, the odds for one or more high visibility failures or defaults cannot be insignificant. In the longer run, Sunday's announcement by the ECB may be just the first shot in a far larger battle for long overdue and much-needed reform of the world's monetary system. But in any event, it is a reminder that what General de Gaulle termed
"an exorbitant privilege" -- the dollar's key currency status -- cannot be maintained indefinitely by a policy of trashing gold.

All:
I just finished reading all the posts today and must say that this is a wonderful group. It's not just the information that's presented as it's great to see it all assembled. Rather, it's good to see everyone offering their feelings (not just their projections) as this market evolves. It's becoming impossible to discuss with everyone because so many people are entering here. Each with their
own slant or take on the day's moves. Very, very good! Michael has created a "one of a kind".

Gold always has been an emotional subject. Especially if you buy it for it's future monetary value instead of trying to quickly trade it for cash. I know there are traders here. It's seen in their cool style and council. For them gold is but a quick paper liquidation and "if I ever need to" it's "off to USAGOLD" to purchase. Hmmmm.

Yes phaedrus, in your world "it ain't going to happen". The failure of paper, that is. But please consider that I move in a different world from you. No, not the high speed "connected" "mover" environment. Rather it's a world attached to a timeline of "ages old" events and "reoccurring human nature". This realm exists today in the minds of a people you will mostly never know. Yet, they hold the very destiny of our modern currency system in their hands. Intelligent, sharp, and filed with "the simple Thoughts", they do very well understand the western differences of common sense. Up vs down, rough vs smooth and most especially "I have" vs "they owes"!

Presently, in your world, the concept of holding "paper gold "they owes"" can and does gain the great percentage returns you reference. I expect your ability to trade will move you quickly ahead of all others before you when the time comes. Then again, it strains credibility to suggest that one could "out trade" every other player when "lightning strikes in the night". I think I saw a movie
where it was counselled "a man's just got to know his limitations". I have been given a view of this storm and my feet are not that fast.

My message (as an extension of Another's) is for the ones that are so very slow. That's me, too! We are doomed to trod the slow path as do the giants, because, in the end things go up faster than traders can revalue paper. Funny as it may seem, all of us will most likely again meet the "fast
traders" though our location in the race will somehow change.
Imagine, if you will the logic of Another:

"This world be still round, my friend. And days have changed with modern toys for boys to play. Though they circle the earth with much speed, full circle bring them but one step "behind me""

Some people may not like the connotations that presents, but boy, it sure keeps my brain clear.

ALL: The end of this currency game will see people trading their hearts out only to use all their winnings to buy the same amount of gold (or much less) they could have purchased in the first place. They did the same thing in Rome, still fighting over economic contracts as the war raged just outside the walls.

Trading IOU paper will never create more gold for anyone until they liquidate and buy. Mostly we don't and what we usually truly gain is only more paper with an "attitude" to prove it. It is against human nature to expect anyone to leave a paper crap table while they are ahead. Millions
and millions of gamblers try to convince themselves and others that they can do it. 99.9% of them never have and never will. It's a siren song as old as time itself. It's the same in the modern stock markets. When the game "truly" ends, few walk away with what they thought they had.

We are on the road of returning to the natural, true monetary values of gold. Values that will not be the one ounce for a suit some still proclaim relevant. It value will be magnified 100 times by the modern advances this society has created. Some will lose their jobs, some will lose money, but the world will not end. Babies will be born and employers will employ. Only the yardstick for measuring wealth will have changed. As events unfold this truth, Another will respond to reference this journey we all will travel. Truly, "events will prove all things".

Thanks ALL FOA

Goldspoon, my vote is "horse with no name" for Platinum. I now remember the song by America.

ALL:
The Russian announcement was in some ways like the English sale. They were asked to publicly say it to drive others to lease before they did (and lower the rate). A ploy only, as some bank shorts withdrew their bid to cover now, waiting to see what would happen (this also lowered
demand (and rates)). The USSR was always the very best at gold trading. Cut your shirt clean off and you never knew you lost it! Dumb, stupid Russian dealers??? No more so than us. Russians good at poker, oh yes. Russians announce deal before the fact to bid themselves a lower rate?? Did anyone buy that one?

I bet Michael still has gold for sale. Still at a good price for a while at least. All you paper traders better take the advise of this old Western Scout, "watch your top knot out there"!

Where gold is now going, no other investment can follow!

We have been on the gold trail for a number of days now and it's time to stop and talk. Everyone has read the USAGOLD HOF site and understands the tie in of gold and oil. Now lets look at how these factors are beginning to close in on our gold markets.

Earlier this year, when gold was just falling into the $280 range we discussed how then was the time to buy large blocks of bullion. Many large entities were taking delivery to avoid the approaching storm. It seemed that $280 had been the magic number. If gold fell below that value there was a risk that the number of paper creations, known as gold derivatives could explode in a final frenzy. Indeed, in the march to $250, the fractional nature of paper gold trading has created a massive glut of "paper gold commitments" that have no gold behind them. Prior to this $250 fall, the gold market was already bursting with derivatives. Enough so to destroy the credibility of any form of real "gold delivery". Today, those numbers are off the charts. Had the ECB and it's consortium of major Euro supporting Central Banks not stepped in to stop the madness, the gold market would have been crushed to the price floor. Long before that floor was reached, the valuations of paper gold would have begun a discount phase. Where their traded price reflected the inability of the bullion markets to supply even a tenth of the real gold that these contracts stood for. Yes, for big investors the time to take delivery was before the lions begun to fight over an ever smaller supply of gold. I thank Mr. PHinLA for posting Another's analogy about the coming "Gold Lions".

One way or another, the modern gold market of today is going to fail. Weather the trading price goes to $1,000 or falls to $10, the massive overhang of gold derivatives cannot be honoured. What physical gold that remains in private hands will be cut free by this failure and trade for a while in "street form". (see Mr. Holtzman in the HOF for a better understanding of this)

I have discussed before how the modern "fractional gold system" was used to multiply the outstanding ownership of gold while the actual physical gold stocks remained static. This allowed the price of gold to fall as this new paper covered the massive demand. Physical gold could then be
used to support fabrication and, more importantly flow in a direction that increased oil supplies. Mr. ORO has searched for a formal agreement or even numbers that account for this process. The numbers are evident as presented, yet the agreement was political in nature.

A few years ago, continued good oil flow required gold below $360. But, below that number, the asian Trader would emerge with tremendous accounts. It wasn't long after the fall below $360 that the LBMA had to make public the enormous buying of their paper commitments. Even as the
Main Central bank committed to keep gold above $280 to preserve value, it was obvious that the paper market would one day implode itself from "fractional gold" creation. The end of our markets was written the day we fell below $360. We embarked on a trail of no return.

Over the last few years the gold market developed with a two tier nature. Entities that had massive oil to supply a needing world would most certainly receive their gold in "allocated" form if they asked for it. Weather it be from private investor who exchanged their physical for holding
paper derivatives or from the vaults of Major CBs, this gold would come from somewhere, "come hell or high water". Truly, with the explosion of gold commitments outstanding today, we can now clearly see how this will unfold.

The modern financing tool we call the "gold carry trade" is now becoming the poison that will kill this market. The demands of gold lenders to return their "at risk" positions are creating an atmosphere where no amount of physical gold exists that can supply the outstanding paper claims. Great blocks of gold are now lent into the markets at 4% or greater, where once 1% was considered a good return. As each new group of lenders enter the market they are followed close behind by former lenders demanding their gold return. Fear begins to grip those who were once bullion owners as they now became paper pawns. Each new demand for "full allocation" creates yet further demands to borrow. The supply of new lenders grows smaller and smaller as the
possibility of default increases.

The ECB moved to block any further erosion of the Euroland position. Most certainly, all world gold contracts denominated in dollars would have gravitated towards Euro conversion to best advantage the EMCB gold stocks. Indeed, in a brilliant move they have blocked that escape and
doomed the dollar gold market to collapse from non delivery. The ECB can now effectively support it's gold commitments thru either bullion allocation or Euro settlement. By marking to the market their gold reserves they will contrast the advantage of a dollar gold market collapse no matter what form it takes. Weather discounting of paper gold from non delivery as derivatives are sold in mass (plunging dollar gold price) or a complete run for delivery (what we are seeing now) that leaves 95% of the market shut down and still holding paper demands ( paper gold priced in the many thousands. prior to lock up), the Euro will gain reserve backing.

Onward:

The mine defaults seen today are just the beginning. For every mine that fails it's stockholders during a $70 gold price increase, fifty will fail from a $2,000 run! Weather the bullion price reflects the "street price" or the "run for delivery paper price", the turmoil will devastate most contract strategies. Why is this happening? Modern people, be them investors, mine managers or "carry trade" operators alike have never seen a true gold market. Their perception of a gold run is where jewellery demand and 6% inflation gun the price to their historical "natural level", $500! Truly, in this world, $500 is where gold starts it's great move.

Our dollar/IMF currency operates on contract liquidity by creating paper IOU that are never called. Be they cash, bonds, CDs or stocks, they represent elevated wealth only because they are never liquidated into real things. If humanity ever decides to sell them (something they will do only if forced from fear), the value of real things quickly increases to a level much higher than the total value of such paper. It does this because, in a panic, things are held back, thereby lowering supply.

The recent (last 10+/- years) gold market has reflected it's transition into a similar paper "contract liquidity" system. This was done to enhance the credibility of the dollar in the eyes of it's trading partners. Today, the Euro system has offered a reason to test the credibility of this gold system. This "new gold market" is not as before and will run in dollar terms unlike anything anyone has ever seen. Gold is now in the process of becoming money and that pricing process will destroy most any contract ever written against gold.

In the future, no investment on earth will keep up with the real value of gold, nothing! It will run until the dollar system is destroyed and a new system takes it's place. The effects and beginning events are starting now. In the background the gold market is under stress, even as small traders make quick paper gains. When the stress breaks into full view, all traders will be "eaten alive" by the next biggest trader. And so on up the food chain. So, why trade. Already, gold bullion has done very well against shares and other metals. What ever small percentage gain one has made above this is for how much risk? I would like to see the owners of Ashanti Goldfields Co trade their paper
gains for bullion tomorrow? We have discussed this often and this is only the first good example. Yet gold has only just begun to move! No option, futures, silver, platinum or gold stock will match gold when it runs $100 a day for days on end (perhaps in a Euro marketplace).


Our road has just begun and I will walk it also. Hold a tight line as we proceed down this dangerous path. It will be a wonderful hike for everyone that can stay on the trail and understand the sights along the way.

Central Bank Cheating!

Central bank policy is never offered to the public in it's true context. They can't afford to! Open directives that involve "historic" changes are usually never interpreted successfully until their "real life" effect is truly seen.

When the ECB, Swiss and BOE all made their announcement, it was publicly taken in the current context of falling gold prices. When I posted "it's all over people", my response was in reply to the future. A future that evolves an escalating gold price environment, the very conditions that the ECB statement would create and was aimed at controlling.

This agreement was more of a commitment to "continue" a certain amount of gold supply "even as the prices rise". Understand that; When an important body states that they are ready to slow an approaching forest fire, every else immediately starts preparing for a fire. Even if it's not in view yet. It should have been obvious that during a surging price period, most (if not all) CBs would stop selling gold and call in lease guarantees! Such a move would lock "all" the markets instead of creating a "controlled burn" of the dollar.

Watch these events as they unfold. True, there will be cheating! However, that cheating will take the form of "CBs buying gold" (and hiding the transaction as well as able) to balance their sales. If the Swiss do sell, we can bet their selling will be delta neutral. Their most likely move will be to commit their gold into the EMCBs in exchange for Euro type derivatives (even if sold for dollars). If anything, the effect on the markets will be to cut physical supplies, in complete contradiction to the ECB / BIS directives.

Mosel, our problem today is not so much a rising price, rather the lack of physical to close outstanding contracts! You are right, dollar liquidity can and will be expanded to cover "bookkeeping defaults", but it will only "extreme" the physical defaults as private lenders demand their gold back! Your deep mind will burn in overdrive as this plays out. I'll keep the fire extinguisher ready to cool off the grey cells (smile).

Like this: "The time has come to support our own currency system. Let any other CB that wants to work with us, also announce this agreement. (I think Japan did also?? Were they hoping against hope??) We are going to stop this thing before it infects our economic system. Tell everyone we will now limit our lending and allow it to shrink through payment liquidation. In addition, we must offer this supply to keep it from burning out of control."

I would have added: "it all over people"! Somehow that would have been seen as gasoline on the fire. No?

Each of us will follow our spirit as this unfolds. If you hold gold in your hand, count it as one ounce they will not posses. Come what may, their contracts are only good if someone delivers gold against them. In like view, Libya never delivered oil to the Hunts. Even though the Texas boys had a contract for it.

SteveH - Your letter - a mechanism
FOA has, once again, portrayed the basic concept of the future he sees from his position, which you assume is a Saudi point of view. For myself, I do not know and will not venture a guess. The form of expression is appropriate to a Saudi official.
The thing most of us miss most of the time, is that the simple fact that everybody's interests, save the governing class in the US, are stacked up towards this new format for floating currencies and reserves. It puts everybody on an equal footing and opens the possibility of a level playing field for both banking and trade. It also eliminates the segnorage of the US in printing the world's medium of trade and debt settlement and has a chance of revaluing the debt of the EMs into insignificance - freeing them from the trap the US bankers sprung on them. (see Mozel post) One more issue is that the gold accumulated in Europe, Asia, and Arabia through trade, and in the US through payments for services in war is given its original weight as the representation of a whole nations' past financial achievements. (again a good Mozel point)
The US elite is very much like the elite of Johnstown before the flood, enjoying the night in a cocktail party as the engineer tells them of the near certainty of the collapse of the dam if the storm outside continues, and even if it stops. As the custodians of the dam run for their lives, having seen water coming through the cracks, the elite continue talking of the new library they will have built, the wives talking of the benefits to the poor, the husbands organizing their conspiracy to rig the bidding. Notice that even the engineer, convinced of the impending disaster and its ramifications - including the high probability of his own death - still comes to the party. (This account is partly fictional - so take no offense)
The working mechanism of the new currency system ANOTHER foresees and is involved in implementing is very straightforward, though only somewhat less fictional than what we have today. It just happens to artificially favor gold.
The manner of strengthening a currency is the main difference from the current system. Each country, and the IMF as well, strengthens its currency by bidding for gold within its borders. As the price of gold increases locally, the backing of the currency has both increased in quantity and in price - and therefore in percentage of backing. Other countries respond according to their need for a stronger or weaker currency for domestic or international political or economic purposes. Through the importation of gold, there is something gained for a net exporter. Through the import of goods, one's currency is necessarilly weakened as it is eventually used to buy gold by the exporter, strengthening their currency relative to the importer. It restores the best aspects of the gold standard in trade and in the settlement of debt, but it will enslave the countries that do not have their own gold and are net debtors. Countries that are US creditors but have no gold will be left with whatever the gold value of the $ would be relative to the Euro, SF and other major currencies.
The gold price in this system has no cap. All have a vested interest in keeping the gold price high. In the meantime, the gold miners will be taxed at incredible rates and gold holders will be picked at as the capital gains taxes on their gold sales are raised over and over. Initially, there would be a strong push to have the gold holders spend the money unhindered, to jump start a shocked economy. After the initial spring time for the gold owners, there would be the atmosphere of growing taxation of gold profits (inducing people not to spend their gold).
Monetary policy would ammount to the throwing of unbacked paper into the market, which would cause the decline of the currency and a surge of exports. The exports will garner a large chunk of gold coming in, and would either displace the currency (if gold is not bought to increase its backing) or will be used by the governmnet to support the currency.
Contrast this with the current system, where one needs to devalue the $ in order to strengthen one's currency, by throwing $ into the market and buying one's own. Thus the $ gained in trade are lost in defense of a currency in what is a sure defeat if you are a debtor nation - the US Fed/banks can invent as many $ as are necessary to borrow your own currency from your banks and dump it on the market. As you raise your interest rates, your economy grinds to a halt and as you supply more of your currency to your creditors as a result of higher interest rates, you are either more in debt, or the funds fall into the market where they eventually lower the value of your currency. If this attack on your currency was accompanied by a rush of hot money out of your financial markets, your economy would be destroyed. Your $ denominated paper would be defaulted, and your debts remain hanging arround your neck like an albatros. These will force you to sell your products and real assets at a discount to their cost and real value, in order to settle $ debt.
The US has been trapped in this way too. It is by far the largest debtor the world has ever seen, in relative size to the world economy, or in relation to its own. The list of creditors is growing as each country resolves it $ debt. Japan made it in the 70s, Germany and France in the 60s, China in 97, Korea Thailand and the Phillipines (almost) in 98 and 99. Russia, Malaysia, and Ecuador are just saying "go #$^& yourself".

I will say this. This new international monetary system too will fail in one way or another, and produce unpredictable results. It is such a new concept that I can't say with certainty how it would work in reality. I have a vague thought that gold would displace the currencies in this system, since it would be the most reliable store of value, less subject to the whims of government.

The Monetary Triangle

------------From reading your most recent thinking as summarized in Msg#15713, I get the distinct impression that you believe that the Europeans have mandated their version of closing the gold window, thus making gold dear for any purpose, the settlement of gold carry trades being the most
severely affected. Some have said that this event of September 26th by the European central banks ranks in the annals of monetary economics with Nixon's closing of the gold window in 1973 and letting yellow metal seek a free market price. Following the Nixon decision, we had ten years of dollar devaluation. On the other hand, the European closing of the gold window could lead to ten years of euro appreciation against the dollar -- the exact opposite of the 1970s U.S. experience.--

Hello USAGOLD,
To the above---- "Absolutely"!!
I don't know if the timeline will be that long (ten years). The dollar will most likely fully collapse into some form of controlled inflation with exchange controls and all. ORO (#15721) wrote a good outline using Another's, trying to conceive the form of a new currency structure without the current dollar system. Today, in the middle of all of this, the pressure is indeed on to increase the value of gold "in all currencies". Make no mistake, no one wants this, but the majority has accepted that this is the only way out from under the dollar.

You write:

----At the same time, if you superimpose a chart of gold in euros over a chart of gold in dollars, a startling observation can be made -- one that graphically shows how much the world of international money has changed. The movement of gold in both currencies is nearly exactly the
same! Having watched the Asian contagion unfold and run the graphs on several sick currencies, there was one relationship that always held true -- as the currency depreciated against in gold, so it depreciated against the dollar. This led me to believe that once the euro was established as an international reserve competitor to the dollar that when the euro went up against the dollar, it would be able to buy more gold. I waited to see if this would be the case and am somewhat surprised to see a new phenomena -- as the dollar has depreciated against the euro, both have depreciated against gold.

Michael,
Continuing from my above: It's going to be a two phase operation. For the Euro to continue gaining credibility against the dollar, it needs a rising gold price in both currencies to build the Euro perception. In this stage they don't want the dollar exchange rate to collapse, but rather draw trade flow settlement into the Euro. It's expected that a steady interest rate policy and the lack of aggressive intervention will place them in a better light. But, most importantly, a rising gold price will detract from the dollar on a world basis more so than it will the Euro on a Euroland basis. Using points we have covered many times, the ECB will have more than enough resources (read that dollars on hand) to keep a firm bid under gold. This act of bring in gold as Euro reserves (not currency backing) and cannot help but undercut the dollar's world position. Especially now that the world dollar gold market is "on the ropes" and about to drive the dollar gold price to the sky.
Their item about commiting gold supply to 2,000 tonnes was a farse. Yes, the supply is needed to controll the burn, but a gold rush will cause much greed to retain the bullion. The BOE may continue, but all of them will cut and run when the gold price starts to rise. I bet they still sell for show but hold a backdoor deal to retain the metal.

Your words,

----How do you interpret this new phenomena -- this new and to my knowledge unique triangular relationship? Does it not give Europe the opportunity, to issue bonds to finance whatever Europe would like to finance including the military, public works projects etc without damaging the euro's credibility or injuring its market? And by this, do not the Europeans solve a sore problem -- getting their new currency into circulation (something you and I have discussed before). If so, this could be a clever political/economic move indeed and might answer the questions why Europe made the September 26th Gold Sunday announcement as they did when they didn't have to. In other words, at the beginning of 1999 EU launched the currency. Now EU is going to get it into circulation internationally in the form of bonds held in national treasuries. The next step will be make it stick. At that point, I would agree with you -- Europe could become a gold buyer unloading unwanted dollars perhaps through the unwinding of the gold carry trade.
Wouldn't it be a total irony, if the gold carry trade turned out to be little more than a detour that brought us the back way to the same place....gold being used in international settlements as the currency of last resort?-----

Yes sir to all of it!
This will process over one to two years. Or does it work out into the new 5 year plan of the ECB? We shall see. The dollar crisis should be worked over by then. Perhaps our much needed time frame to work gold into the thousands?
Once the Euro begins to see a run for it's currency (next year or so?) the gold price in Euros will stop rising as fast as the dollar gold price. Simply stated, the dollar/Euro exchange rate will halt most of the depreciation of Euros against gold. This is the second phase that Another spoke of long before the Euro was even born. Here we see gold at perhaps several thousand Euros, yet in the many many thousands of dollars. This is why it was so important for them to hold ECB committed gold paper. Euroland could later lock a low oil price using high gold as partial settlement. It will be a spectacular boom for their economy.

Michael, it's world class history in the making, Yes? Thanks FOA

PH,
Have waited for the day when I could lean back and read these events in the words of others. We are all riding a new "bullish investment trend line" called "understanding"! It's great to see so many at this forum (and others) cutting through the fog and seeing a new world of "gold bullion".
Not just the trader world of paper profits.

Look at this new item: "The Debacle in the Gold Market" and it's link above. Here are a few pieces of it:

-----History has shown us that this type of activity always ends in a disaster of sorts for theplayers and indeed for most market participants. ---------

---We have stated before that in some ways there were two markets, one running on the back of the other. ------

----What was being created here was the mother of all debacles, simply because the paper market was deemed to be real, when, in fact it was as illusory ----------------

---------All the players in this paper market are at risk, and in fact were at risk the moment the made their first foray into it. The extent and ramifications of that risk will become clear over the next several months but it carries far greater implications than most commentators are awareof. ----------

-----Currently most aspects of the gold market (one notable exception being ownership to physical metal purchased prior to this latest rise in price) including gold stocks are at best a pool of very muddied waters and will remain so until this artificial paper gold market ceases to exist and we are some time away from that event. --------------

AL,
Intrusion is the reason this forum exists. (smile)
The old concepts of "one ounce buys a suit" was never honest. It just so happened that during that timeline of "relatively" free markets the value worked that way. Today, gold's value in no way comes even close to reflecting all the technological advancements that have impacted our buying power. Yes, in currency terms a suit is priced well, but our buying power was robbed from currency inflation. Here is where the years of money "overproduction" have taken their toll. Because of manufacturing advances the cost of goods
should have been far less than today. In reverse terms, if the true dollar inflation was evident, a suit would cost several thousand. This is how we can see gold in the many thousands even before dollar price inflation impacts it's price. We will live to see gold gain value in "very real terms" against every form of wealth. Gains that will become evident well in advance of the dollar price inflation that is to come. Holding physical gold today is a "real value" asset, far in excess of what the current trading
proclaims it to be. You have but to walk this trail a little further to witness "nature in full bloom".

http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/00goldDXY.html
Tomorrow, this trail will begin an incline that few of us will make. After we make camp, consider this before the sun rises on our worst expectations:

Leigh and ALL,
I just had a glass of wine to quiet my apprehension of what is to come. It is my belief that the "Gold wars" are about to begin. Please consider this "a very open viewpoint".

I think it's now to late for the dollar to "initially" surge with gold during this crisis. As an old, indebted currency, the dollar will have to share any flight to quality with the Euro. I say this in the same light that Michael stated in his: USAGOLD (10/07/99; 15:18:27MDT - Msg ID:15788) The Monetary Triangle.

------------From reading your most recent thinking as summarized in Msg#15713, I get the distinct impression that you believe that the Europeans have mandated their version of closing the gold window, thus making gold dear for any purpose, the settlement of gold carry trades being the most

Following the Nixon decision, we had ten years of dollar devaluation. On the other hand, the European closing of the gold window could lead to ten years of euro appreciation against the dollar -- the exact opposite of the 1970s U.S. experience.-------------

The ECB/BIS declaration was little less than an announcement that the dollar will now have to stand on it's own. The implications of this are awesome for all of us! Look at the link above and look slowly at the charts. I expect a type of currency war to now begin. No, not one of competitive devaluation's or tit for tat interest rate changes, rather a war about "long term viability " and "ability to weather the coming storm". The rules of engagement have changed and now include "real reserve values" in the battle. Truly the race to increase the value of gold has started. Review the words of Mr. Greenspan as given in PH in LA's 15926: (Note: There was rumour in Washington in the spring that the major powers were rethinking gold. I think PH's quote was made in that time!)

----------Greenspan told Congress then: "We should hold our gold. Gold still represents the ultimate form of payment in the world. Germany in 1944 could buy materials during the war only with gold. Fiat money in extremis is accepted by nobody. Gold is always accepted..."--------

If one stands high upon a hill and views the future battle scene, we wonder how in the world the hapless gold shorts could have wondered into the middle of this. Couldn't the entire gold industry see that this could not end without an asset war? They will be cut to shreds in the early attacks. Not unlike this first shot fired. Mines, the finance houses that support them, dealers that must cover their risk,,,, all of them must feel the rumble of heavy CB armour as it approaches. Make no mistake, the valves that control the flow of lent gold "guarantees" are being closed. In addition, from what I have just understood, I now fully well expect we will not see the 2,000 tonnes of gold sold into this coming crisis. In an earlier post I felt they would at least stay with the spirit of the agreement and
sell some of it. The hard line I hear now is "damn the implications"!

The thousands and thousands of contract derivatives that now are outstanding today, cannot possibly be covered now with delivered gold at any price. This situation is going to "seriously" escalate.

When people say that they will gladly sell gold at $5,000, I counter that they must have never experienced war, "up front and personal". Remember, battles don't become "HOT" because everyone is "gladly" selling their "now in demand weapons" to the highest bidder! Gold will cross
$1,000 because everyone is buying it at $1,000 and asking for more. Trust me, when your neighbours are buying 1/32 ounce wafers with whatever money is in the house, you won't be unloading bars to buy a new house. Nor will any strong spirit trader be selling short a ten lot on comex !
Believe it!

This same dynamic is not lost on the human controllers at the CBs. Yes, they breath and feel the same media vibrations you take in. During the events directly before us, any and all contracts will be swept along on this raging river of economic turmoil. Be they contracts for, gold, currencies, bonds, stocks or commerce, all of them will lose credibility as the worlds massive trade settlements shifts from one medium to the next. Just as in Greenspan's line of thinking, when the armies invade the grab the rare coins, art work and gold. Forget the currency!

As these events progress real assets don't devalue. No, just your ability to profit from their ownership comes into question. Like this: If a forest fire suggests that all forest owners may be at risk, then any gold miner will share the risk of his "rooted gold" being burned also. The currency that is at risk of change today is the dollar. Therefore we can be assured that any company that owns what has become a "currency war weapon" (gold) will own "questionable assets", especially US assets. With England now running into Euroland, the Anglo/Euro mines in South Africa may be less in play? The risk of a plunging American stock market is enough for US mines without the influence of the "gold money" issues that now impacts the dollar. Outside of the "Gold Fields" play for bullion being in the best interest of all bullion owners, I feel all world mines are at risk. However, for ones that must hold a portion in these asset areas, consider what I have said. Choose your
holdings well!

All of this sounds a bit extreme, yet what I see directly ahead is extreme. Look again at the above chart and follow the gold lines. Unless the Dollar/IMF forces place several billion dollars of margin at risk to sell tens of thousands of contracts, gold just may run off that chart in the next week or two. Or less! Truly, the world has changed and I believe most of the gold industry is now caught
up in this financial change. A realignment of epic proportions. As of today, I see the money for rescue is not coming. This market is about to be fed to the lions because this battle involves something much larger and important than the industry. The new gold valuations alone will negate
the need for fresh supply and therefore lower the strategic need to maintain the owners value in these assets.

In addition, the two engines of wealth that were so long the saving force in the American economy are about to react to this major change of world value perceptions. Watch the chart above as the US stock markets parallels a failing currency. The next month or so may indeed make history. We shall see.

PH, you are right, in time perceptions of real events overcome a persons fear to react.

Hello Cassius,
The Comex margins increase will hurt the shorts as bad as the longs. It is different this time. Most of the big trade houses are going to be carrying a ton of defaulted gold paper. In this new environment they can't cover their commitments with real bullion either. Because there isn't enough around at "any" price or lease rate, period! So, they need the Comex speculators now more than ever as these BBs will also be buying long to at least "paper hedge" the bookkeeping side of their position. This is why the option OI and the futures OI are about to go ballistic (at least until they shut down the market). Some people hear me say this and they think a $100 or $200 move won't close anything. I agree, but that is far from what is coming. Like this:

"HK opens up $35. London AM fix +$97. Comex opens lock/limit +$75 on far out months and trades only front month. London PM +168. Comex front month trades "one contract" +$223 then no floor person will move. The exchange closes for the day. HK opens +354, on about 1,000 ounces and closes. Next day, London doesn't open at all, no fix possible. Indications +1,500.""

Now, my friend, do you really think anyone will be settled? This is the type of market that is coming. After a few months to a year or so, somewhere a gold market will reopen. All the while, "street gold" will work at (use your best imagination)?

Can't happen you say? It already has. The markets just don't reflect the corner in place. They will!

On your proposal for Gold to reach $30000, could you please give me a value in Euros, which you feel Gold could reach.

Hello Neo,
I use this big gold figure because that's the best reference to understand just what the dollar is going to do. Another's group understood this some time ago and projected a trend line into this area. Basically the concept stated, in gold terms, just how far the world trading/economic system would withdraw from using dollar reserves. Obviously, it will take some time and a grinding realignment to reach anything in that level. Never the less, it has now started and will initially run into the thousands before anyone knows what happened. All currencies (the Euro included) will fall against gold at first. The turmoil will be too great to suggest otherwise.

The big difference in the Euros favour is that they are a closed economic system. Their economy can work running a trade surplus or a neutral position. Initially, any increase in gold reserve values will balance their new "financial" exports as the the crisis creates a run to hold Euros. They will not be exporting inflation, as the US does, rather external foreign holdings should balance increased gold reserves. Especially as they cover some of their portion of gold commitments by paying out currency or issuing treasury debt. This is the real reason gold will initially rise so quickly, this massive reserve build-up is exactly what will make the Euro work as the world's reserve. Instead of
selling debt based upon the taxing power of the state as the US has done for so long. Instead of trying to hold the dollar price of gold, the ECB will let the Euro price run. There is no need to worry that gold will drive out the currency from use as we have become too advanced to operate without a digital settlement. That function alone creates a new "value" function for paper currencies that never existed in days gone by.

Today, one can hold a Euro account at any Euro bank. It's there now for the taking. True, gold will outrun this currency, but even major bullion holders still must hold a digital currency for trade. And by the very nature of the present market, not everyone can own bullion to the full extent of their holdings. Physically, it can't happen for years (or until gold hit's the high numbers above). Most
big hedgers will own "allocated" gold and Euros, waiting for whatever mix their remaining " Euro paper gold" will be paid in (in a year or so?). We can all expect gold to be broken into very small trading vehicles as it's price rises. I doubt we will ever use it in actual trade outside the Middle East Dinar arena. Yet, even there paper money will still be used for international settlement.

I think few investors truly realize the "knife's edge" this dollar based gold market is on. Most of them cannot see that it cannot be "played" using paper. We must look past the "currency war scene in the valley" to grasp where gold will be valued after this transition works out.

Currently people talk about the US selling gold in some form of options or physical. Clearly they did not hear Greenspan's words (see PH's post) about the need for our gold to be totally "uncommitted" at this time. The only thing the present banking structure can do is throw more
money at the paper gold markets. In as much, they use cash margin bookkeeping to create more "gold-less" contracts to drive the price down. That's all, nothing more. For the paper player (most mine stock owner included) such a move would crush them. Yet, it can only end with a defaulted
gold delivery and a closed marketplace. Investors say the officials will never do that, but how will they continue to function this market? Presently, virtually all lenders are calling for their gold back or at the very least converting to a self liquidating schedule. As this first round of defaults roll in the managers are frozen to borrow gold so they stay off the bid side of the lending rates. Yes, they are using options, futures and the world OTC arena to cover their "bookkeeping", but it has the effect of building the eventual amount of physical cover needed.

England has done all they can do to help and now even they have signed on to the Euroland arena. Truly, this gold market is being sacrificed in the face of a major transition of world financial dealings. Perhaps the ECB will reconsider and cover some important people? No, I doubt it as gold has just been placed squarely in the middle of this realignment and the LBMA is in trouble, big time.

Besides, even the dollar/IMF faction are clearly behind a big rise in the gold price. They don't have to choose between making the industry whole or not. That decision has already been made, right there in Washington. They know the dollar price of gold is going way up because the oil/gold
connection disappeared with the Euro. You know they took the crude oil rise seriously now, because they are buying time by selling off the strategic reserve. If they do, we will look back on that move and see that the reduction of this "emergency" holding plays right into the hands of the oil
producers. We shall see.

On the Road..............

ALL,
One last thing then I'll be away for a while.
I often hear about ABX having hedged with "spot deferred contracts" that allow them to defer the delivery of gold to cover. Perhaps for ten years! During this time they mine and sell gold at whatever high price comes along.

One thing they never offer is how they are going to cover their additional margin (do they need margin??) as these contracts are deferred. Are we to believe that the gold lenders are just going to sit back and allow the company to sell off gold in the thousands, making tons of money as they deplete their reserves? I don't think so! I would think that all the money ABX could make would be needed needed to cover margin in a big gold rise?? In addition, in the event of market disruptions (read that long term market shutdown) real gold would be "forced diverted" by the lenders to cover contracts. And let's not even think of the massive "inflationary" price pressures a dollar decline would bring to the operating cost of their US based assets. Just something to consider while we are "On the
road...."?

Good luck this week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FOA

USAGOLD and ALL:
I just read this link as presented above. Do my eyes deceive me or is "this new gold market" now being understood!! YES! My friends, events are progressing and change is in the air! I find it all so incredible that only a few years ago most people invested in the gold industry as a clean "supply and demand" product that also offered a little "gold money" / "inflation protection built in.
Manipulation was only for those "on the fringe of reality"! Yet, a small group choose to look at it as the true "Political" metal it has always been. Michael Kosares, Bill Buckler (privateer) and a host of others understood the real realm of "gold money" and "gold power".

Strangely, it wasn't until "this new gold market" started killing the paper investments that other people really stood up and asked questions. So I ask, if the political gold manipulation had driven gold paper higher, would anyone have bothered to search for truth for the average investor? Hmmm!
Don't get me wrong, today is a good day for "understanding". Because, as "we watch this new gold market together" this "now exposed manipulation" isn't going away. Truly, what makes this such a good day is the fact that the "ECB/BIS is now going to "manipulate" the dollar market in the goldbugs favour. Nothing more, nothing less. Indeed, anyone that has read Mr. Kosares's books and seen the posts on this forum (especially the Hall of Fame site) has seen this coming for some time. Truly, we know there are several more acts in this play. It's not just about the gold industry being vindicated or a group of major gold bears losing face (and money). It's about a changing way of "Western" life and most of us are going to experience it.

Still, I must openly congratulate Mr. Bill Murphy and thank him for all his great efforts. He alone has placed himself in harms way in order to "get the word out". It's working.

I know that only a few more moves on the world economic chess board will bring Another out writing again. If what I understand is true, the most interesting part of this game lies "dead ahead".

SteveH,
Tell Leroy to watch oil. We are going to know that the political game has shifted to Europe if the producers cut production again in response to opening the "strategic reserve". If that happens, from whatever level gold is trading at that time, it will explode. After that, this whole story will come out.

Platinum Lease Rates
While you are here, can you say anything about the exorbitant lease rates currently being published for platinum? Three-month rates are up over 9% to 68%(?) today. Sounds like time to start leasing out my platinum Visa card. Any takers? Yet through all this, the price has not really reacted.

PH,
Goldspoon's Platinum horse is something else. I drugged it when he wasn't looking and it still ran?

We all have to look at the metals rental rates with a questioning eye. During normal conditions, such high platinum rates (and even gold rates a week back) would indicate severe "risk" in loaning out metals. Today, all of these rates are way out of any "operational contract usage". I speaking of major volume usage here, not the small dealer fabricator level. Let's call it the "money gold" arena!
Anyway, the entire metal funding market is practically frozen in low volume. The rates could just as well say 200% and wouldn't mean anything.

Right at this minute, rates aren't moving the markets because all the "workouts" to cover the exposure are concentrating on the "bookkeeping" side of the equation, paper gold and to a much smaller extent paper platinum. If the firms cash capital isn't enough to cover the "workouts', then someone must go to the physical markets and outright "buy physical" or "borrow physical". Here is where the "big sweat" is happening "right now"! For many months there hasn't been enough excess physical supply for buying to cover any "non rollovers", so they borrowed it against the firms capital base. Now, no one wants to lend "new" and everyone wants to at least convert to a "self liquidating" term. So, if you read my post (yesterday?), if "official" money doesn't come in and cover the loses or sell down the paper price, the workouts are going to fail, big time! In that event the rush will be to buy physical because even at huge rates, big risk is keeping supply small for lending.

Now to answer your question, the Platinum lending market is small and physical owners are watching gold (sorry for that Goldspoon). If gold breaks to the upside, now, it will cascade into an avalanche of wiped out lenders (the actual physical lenders and the naked short kind) and kill all
credibility of the lending market. For the next two weeks or so if gold doesn't fall , forget the rates, we have escalated far beyond any point of significance for them.

Spot buying and selling of physical is still happening. Even though some bottle necks are there. However, once we move a little further over the edge of the cliff, physical may freeze up too! Note: I saw where some mine management's are now "actively" working with the BBs to try and work out a process to get the price of gold down! I wrote that this "mindset was coming soon" in one of my posts not long ago and someone over here thought it was "out of order". In other words such private discussions would never make mainstream! It did!

am I to understand that Gold Fields is uniquely positioned to weather the onslaught of dollar devaluation, due to some bullion holdings? Or am I delusional, thinking that any paper investment could outperform gold, as the rug is ripped
out from under our world of financial instruments?

Hello Elevator Guy,
Gold Fields LTD. (GOLD) bid for physical at the last BOE auction. They even got some 12% of it. To my knowledge they were the first mining company to openly support the "bullion advocate" community by buying gold instead of just optioning more of it. Yes, they do have a tiny hedge. It is nothing for them. Their actions were openly out of line in the BB sector.

I purchased their stock and presented then as an example of a gold mine for "bullion advocates" to purchase. Symbolically, I burned the stock to indicate I would never sell it at any price. In some cultures, burning a property deed means you will never sell the land. I believe a good number of physical gold owning entities are and will follow this concept in support of Gold Fields. In addition, any other mining company that buys in it's hedge by purchasing gold will see the same activity. Perhaps a bit late now.

EG, sometimes we do things not to make money. Better to support what is right, no? I walk in large foot prints, come what may!

Bad Day for POG Anyone care to speculate as to why?

Hello Canamami,
Yes, I'll have a word. But first to all.
I found an old Another post(see below)written for him in Dec. 1997. In it he described what may be about to happen today or perhaps during tomorrow's tomorrow. Surely it is a council given to high profile people of means. Entities that can't turn on a dime what it took a lifetime to build. Yet, even us regular people must walk the same road of reason.

My purpose for showing it was to point out the longevity of gold and how it transports wealth better than paper. Anyone that purchased bullion around the $360 or $370 range at the time that post was written, is only down some $30 to $40 and is currently in an atmosphere that may even erase those loses. Yet during this past time span, gold options, futures and leveraged contracts savaged an investor's account. In addition, most all mine shares were crushed and some disappeared all together. Ironically, some mine shares may now suffer if gold does rise. Insult heaped upon misery?

All the while, a bullion holder was in total control, never waiting for the annual report or the unsettling news. Truly, they were holding an asset that could "run like the wind blows" when the storm clouds gather. With a full understanding of gold money dynamics, they were all the while expecting a greater real return with less risk. You see, for most conservative investors and portfolio hedgers, gold only needs to make one real run in a lifetime. Indeed, in some crisis circumstances, even running in place will win the race and be more than one could ask for! Gold works, because the history of paper money has shown that the timeline of every "extended family" suffers through at
least one such world crisis. During these times wealth holdings of most every other asset is lost or impacted beyond one's years to repair!

Today, I believe we stand right at the edge of one of those moves. A gold move that will more than justify ten, twenty or thirty years of bullion accumulation. Unfortunately, most Western minds will not or cannot imagine gold ever running so far, so fast. So they grasp for leverage in every form of gold paper, even extending that reach into Platinum and Silver. I, and a few others of "Western mind" now fully see this storm and anticipate it's unruly effects on all asset classes.

--------------------

Canamami
If we look at the last few days, Dec. gold trading during comex hours has bottomed right at $318:
Low
10/12 $318.00
10/11 $318.20
10/08 $318.00

It has done this as oil has crashed from liquidation of paper traders. Yet, gold does not fall as it should. It doesn't fall because the supply of crude is being cut further and the oil futures are about to reverse this drop. This is a public statement that goes far beyond OPEC considerations. It points to a transition of economic structure such as we have never seen. The risks to world wealth that this change will bring will now drive major portfolio adjustments.

I think massive physical gold buying has arrived in the form of "full allocation" demands from all gold depositors and lenders. Those demands will now fracture our modern gold markets. Be they from Hong Kong, The Middle East or Europe, these present bullion holders are buying more gold by recalling their paper derivatives. Truly, a gold run of world class proportions laid upon the steps of a failing price fixing arena. These demands constitute the "exercise of a corner" on gold that has long been in place.

This demand will now not only make an end run around the carry trade, it will gun the price so fast that most all "working gold contracts" without "official guarantees", will fall into negotiations and litigation. This corner will crack the markets because the ECU/BIS has said "make it so". These effects will now be seen in our entire financial structure.

Is this a good viewpoint to hold? We shall see!

So today was a good day for gold, if you are a bullion holder, that is. A good day, indeed!

thank you FOA

ANOTHER (THOUGHTS!) ID#60253:
Will we have "Deja-vu" again?

Some people have followed the gold market from 1970. Some have followed it all their lives, depending on when you were born. Some say they were right, as the market has fallen and they held "no gold". They council from experience and a short life.
But, some have traded gold from times before. Those who trade with the sun know we will never have "Deja-Vu" again. This market is unlike anything from the past. And those with a "short life" of investing will learn from this coming future as gold will show their knowledge was limited to where they stood on the mountain!
Unlike the past, this market has an end. And this end will not be for those who have waited to buy! They see this bottom at $100 or $200 or $250, and they will buy at the turn as no fool should have held from $360! But, I say they will buy only paper if lucky!
All should make ready and be holding metal only, as the turn will move $100+ the first day and $200 the second day as comex is closed! It will trade no more from the 3rd day on! The gold market of your youth will be no more! For those who were smart from experience not to buy at
$400, will look at $600 as "the deal of a lifetime".

To close,
Try to live in this outcome and see how different the world will be. It will not be the end of all things, only the changing of most things in "western thought". The "Digital Currencies" will still trade, but we will value them as not before. Anyone who has sold gold they do not have will not be allowed to cover that position. Anyone who has brought gold they do not have will not be allowed to cover that position. Many will lose all they have in a world without honor! Looking back , one will ask, "how could I have thought that noone wanted gold, when more of it was being brought than existed"?
Indeed, more gold than exists or will be produced in the next ten years! And some say, "only a fool would say the market was cornered". During that time, a gold stock in the hand will not trade on an open market! And the government of the country, of the land, of the mine, will no doubt speak with you of new taxes on GOLD!
A year has passed as the winds of change have started to blow. Waste no more time on paper gold, you have suffered enough. Play paper games no more, as the future of your family waits a decision.

OIL
NEW YORK ( CBS.MW ) -- Oil futures on Wednesday are poised to rally for a second straight day after the latest inventory data revealed a drop in crude oil supplies more than three times market expectations, restoring market watchers' faith in OPEC's promises to control supplies.

"This is going to be a shocker!" exclaimed
Phil Flynn, vice president and senior
market analyst at Alaron.com.

The data on crude oil will "catch
everybody off guard" and make investors
think the recent selloff was probably
overdone," Flynn said. The market
appears to have hit its low and could test
the highs. On Sept. 29, the November
contract hit an intraday high of $25.12 a
barrel, only to plunge to a low of $20.55
only nine days later.

After the markets closed on Tuesday, the
American Petroleum Institute reported a
7.14 million barrel decline in crude oil
inventories. Analysts had expected
supplies to fall less than a third of that
figure, with estimates averaging around a
drop between 1.5 million to 2 million
barrels for the week ended Oct. 8.
Supplies now total 298.9 million.

"So where's all this cheating by OPEC?" asked Flynn. The enormous drop in crude oil supplies could renew the market's confidence in OPEC's attempts to keep a cap on global oil production levels, after weaker-than-expected compliance last month, shook investors' faith.

Ahead of the news on the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude gained $1.03 cents to $23.30 a barrel by the close. As soon as the API data was released, however, November crude exploded, jumping 50 cents in overnight trading.

Comment
Strad Master, welcome and glad to see you here!

ALL,
Today was a good day for gold, again. It looks as if the beginning realignment of the dollar against the Euro is beginning to affect the financial markets.

I have seen several write-ups by our well paid "bold bears" Mr. Smith and Mr. Arnold. They certainly do have a good understanding about how Euroland values gold. An understanding that, in their reference of experience must span all of twenty years+/-?? Truly, their full life comprehension of assets must have never seen total loss due to war, economic failure or political injustice. Why else would they so boldly speak for an entire continent of people and the official monetary stance of their leaders.

These "paper boys" would have the EMCBs sell off gold because holding more interest earning dollars will back the Euro more effectively, right? Conversely, even a fool would see that the US should then print more of it's currency and buy the debt of any higher yielding countries. Why miss
out on all of that return by just "holding the ability to print money and not use it"? Their concept would see a printing press as an asset with no return.

Again, the "paper boys" are following a path that's made "sensible" because in their lives they have most likely not been defaulted on. Gold does not pay a return as a reserve asset because it isn't lent like the currencies. Lend it out and it's at risk, just like the currencies. Hold no unlent gold (or paper money) and you have no reserves outside of risk.

It begs the question; why not lend out all real assets? Lend out every thing that's held in quantity, the chairs, books, lights, bricks, food! Get a return on everything useful? If it's usable, someone will borrow it and pay a return. Truly, young boys always look smart until the world makes fools of them. They pretend to speak for the masters as long as followers listen to and act on their concepts. I think that, this whole group has entered a play written by oil and the BIS. What they are about to experience is "the last act".

Today, the real ECB masters have brushed aside these loud youths as concern for their Euro Gold takes precedent. As the need to hold an "unlent currency of world class" becomes undeniable, the "paper boys" will suddenly mature into "grown wise men". With new jobs perhaps? and much poorer for the ware?, no doubt, but wiser in the future, never the less.

Presently, the US holds (percentage wise) little foreign exchange currency because it's position is one of setting interest rates on the world reserve currency to effect it's value. The years of being the major trade settlement currency allows such a luxury. Negate this position in it's present economic condition and the US will have to face severe inflation. I believe, investors world-wide will attempt to run from the dollar by buying gold. This fear is manifest in the ongoing success and advancement of the Euro.
If the "paper boys" (above) even half way understood this position, they would see that it's the dollar reserve holdings of the EMCBs that are "dead assets". As the Euro ascends to the world reserve position, it will, like the present US dollar, be able to affect value through interest rates alone. Foreign currency reserves will begin to fade in importance. Indeed, what good are interest bearing dollar reserves when the country of origin is running a trade surplus? How does one use a dollar (and it's interest) if the trade flow never flows into the US? Indeed, how does one effect a "profitable interest return" on dollar reserves if it takes a major devaluation to reverse said trade flows?

If one does not buy goods from America then a further rebuttal asks; if the alternative to buying goods is buying assets, then why invest more money into a foreign country if your own is growing faster?
If Euroland begins to run as a currency transition tears apart the Dollarland, our "paper boys" will find that the only "dead asset" in the EMCBs reserves may just be Dollar!

ORO, I read your ORO (10/13/99; 17:12:48MDT - Msg ID:16267)------ and vote for a combination of (2) the severe devaluation of its currency both at home or abroad, or (3) the default of external debt, Russian style. Also add extreme foreign exchange controls aimed directly at the
Euro. One of the reasons internal "street gold" will run so far! Question, when do your posts stop getting "better" (smile).

---- My first question, though, is this: If gold should rise to, say, $30,000 per oz as FOA predicts, how, at that time could one's gold holdings be unwound? For what? $30,000 in paper money? Or would the actual gold bullion become the only negotiable currency? If so, what good would a one oz.buillion coin be? It can't be cut apart into small pieces
with a pair of garden shears. Beyond that, Goldbugs are notorious for holding onto their physicalholdings long past the time of maximum return. ----

(((NOTE: Strand: I find it interesting that goldbugs have become "notorious" for bad moves when their present universe has only existed some 20 years? and the lady has not sang the song yet?)))

You continue:
---In fact, I'm sure that some older people who post at this forum have held gold through several (albeit relatively minor by comparison) upmoves in gold only to kick themselves for not having sold at or near the top.----

(((Note: I know people that have been buying through this entire span of time! True, they have timed their buying on a cost averaging basis, but that concept has made then almost even today. In the believe it or not department. Ask MK about "cost averaging" using a fixed dollar amount. Then
I suggest you see the show "Rollover" with Jane Fonda. You would not believe how true it is!)))

Hello Strad,
I'm going to ramble on a bit, so I hope this helps your perspective.

Back in the early oil days I was very close to some of the largest oil men in the country. When in Texas we would visit at the country club and shared a lot of our perceptions. Usually over a poker table. Looking back, I find their (and mine) viewpoints had much in common with the gold outlook today.

When oil went from around $3.00 to $5.00 everyone that had local reserves thought they had made a fortune. You wouldn't believe how many sold off not only their storage barrels but their best (lowest cost production) reserves for cash. The feeling was that oil had just zoomed in price
and would quickly go back down. The percentage gain on those leveraged assets was simply huge.

Then oil went up to around $8.00! Good god, we were so stupid to have sold. What a bunch of buying fools out there. Those idiots buying $8 are going to get killed. Everybody knows the major producers can pump for $1.00. Oh well, it just a political thing.

When oil hit $15, some of them knew they had missed out on a train to $20. But they still thought oil would one day return to around $5.00. So as not to miss out completely many of the early sellers jumped on the Natural Gas wagon, using everything they had gained from their first sale. At first this new move made money, big time. Then something funny happened, oil soared and later returned to a more normal $18 to $25 range, but gas plunged from the higher supplies. The "oil boys" turned "gas boys" lost it all. Even into today, gas has never returned.

Truly, they used the silver vs gold concept, thinking the more leveraged natural gas would out run oil and regain their fortunes. It made sense as gas (like silver) was more industrially useful and "CHEAPER". You might even say it was the "poor mans oil" (smile)! Also: Just like silver, gas
proved to exist in much larger amounts that the "statistics" demonstrated. As it's price "coat tailed" oil, it brought out the massive increase in production that wasn't needed as long as oil was available. Incredibly, this was the exact same story for silver. All the stories about people buying silver as gold went up saw them sell the silver and keep the gold because people just didn't need both of them. The same will happen when gold runs this time. People will keep the high unit cost gold in their vaults, use the digital currencies for trade and sell the silver as it floods out of the woodwork.

Onward:

You see, oil in the early 70s is like seeing the prevalent gold concept today. The perception was that oil could never go up from the $1.00 production range into the $20s (just an unimaginable increase to those in the business) because such a price would flood the world with production. It was thought that there was so much unfound oil in the world that every home owner would have an oil drilling rig in their back yard at $20+. Just as $10,000 gold will have people taking gold from sea water.

Here is where reality gets in the way of concept based on perceived conditions. Yes, the $20 and $30 oil did bring out the rigs and production soared. But, even at the higher prices, the world found uses for this great new gusher of oil. The same human traits that dictate that "you can never
have enough money in the bank" also said "we can never use too much oil"! If all the oil reserves in the world could produce at $2.00 then the price would return to $2 plus a profit. But, we want and use all oil produced from fields that pump from $2 cost on up to $30. Gold and oil are not like any other commodity, because under the right circumstances, people find both of their qualities useful
and can never get enough of them at any price. It seems we accumulate assets until we die?!

The "paper boys" try and paint a picture of gold like "old oil men" looked at values "back then". They were wrong and so are the "paper boys" today. The Smiths and Arnolds of the world try to convince us that the supply of gold is never used up and creates a glut as it grows. They say that
unlike oil that is consumed, gold holdings have become a stockpile that refining cannot use up. I bet these guys would have also sold their oil reserves in the mid 70s also.

Where they miss the boat is in their assumption that people will get enough gold. Not if it's money, they won't! People do consume money just like oil, rather it's just in the form of "savings consumption". Gold, just like money has an "unlimited demand". Again, have you ever seen anyone
that said "I have too much money and have no more use for it". "No, don't give me any more of that cash, I've got a glut of it now, go away"! Yea, right!

Often, we read where people say, "oh what am I to do with all this gold if it hits, $30,000?". Funny how Bill Gates never says "what am I to do with all these MS shares". Well, you too will act like anyone with to much cash or assets, just stash it away until you need to spend it. The old "what will I do with all this high priced gold I can't get change for" logic just doesn't compute when dealing
in reality? Ever see someone in a flea market rolling around a cart full of $100 bills,,,and frantically trying to unload it because it buys so much and they can't get change? Help me out here, am I not seeing something?

I'm afraid that even the very poorest of people have a better grasp of spending and saving value than some of the "big time investors" present about gold. (I'm talking about the brokers, Strand)

Onward:

Anyway: The amounts of gold in vaults today is no where near enough to represent the only circulating world money. It would have to be priced at $++++++ to do that. So, if mine production can continue, the world will take any and ll they can produce. Be it 3,000 ton a year or 10,000 a year because the demand for money (even a parallel supplement money) is unlimited. Personally, I would take all of it (smile) and let the rest of you keep the paper.

The reality of this is that people hold cash in banks as it is lent out and earns interest. If no one lent their cash and just saved it (like gold) to spend in later years, it would take an enormous amount of paper money. This is why the US goes to great lengths to identify gold to the public as a commodity, not money. They want you to know that it must be sold as soon as it goes up. Trade it, don't save it. Most Western investors have brought into this and are going to pay dearly because of it. Again money demand is "unlimited". The same will be true for gold. As people begin to buy gold as a currency supplement, to be spent "as needed", the price could reach enormous levels.....and
be seen just like oil............a useful asset you just can't get enough of.

canamami,
Thanks for taking the time to offer your thoughts. This is indeed a giant chess game that will keep everyone guessing on the sidelines. Interesting about the CNBC question.
As I said earlier, I'm going to bid on some bullion during this break (if it turns out to be a real physical one) and may add some platinum to the mix. I offered before that My mix had some silver (small amount) and now I must buy some of "the other white metal" just to keep up with
Goldspoon. If it falls some, I'll have it.
Now if only the spreads on (all) the metals will fall some, we just may find something. I have my doubts that this is a real pullback because every large player is looking to not only buy metal for cover, but to also buy time. In addition, some real long "hard hands" are into adding any physical they can get as this proceeds. We shall see. FOA

Hello Yellin of Troy,
Nice write up in 16355. I have a question? In the minds of average citizens, what would you think the difference is between a $10,000 dollar bill and one ounce of gold at $10,000?
I know that these old "big bills" are out of use, but when they were around their buying power must have been at least equal to $30,000. Of course I'm assuming that one of these currency units managed to slip into circulation, but it was still legal tender never the less. So, do I spend it, no way it's to large, yet it's still worth $10,000. Let's say I put it under the bed with the gold piece. As a simple person, how do I come to the conclusion that gold must be sold before it loses value and not the large dollar bill? Especially if people are trading with both of them. Is one money and the other not because I can pay taxes and debts legally only with the paper unit?

I have often found that the saving of wealth is an end unto itself. The more people hold what is perceived dear, the more dear it becomes. Irrational human nature that defines the physical laws, no?

ALL:
Somehow, I believe the CB of China is playing a part in today's gold moves. They may have replaced a lenders demands for gold by not calling for delivery of some other contracts. Thereby balancing (or should I say unlocking) the market. It's not as it seems because their move may be
what was needed to force trading to continue?? Honestly, this is totally conjecture on my part coming from some items heard. I do know that demand for physical is strong now as I am "in line". We may run tomorrow if this action has free up the gears?

Blair Gathers Force for Battle of Euro

Cross-Party Coalition Seeks to Counter Conservatives' Anti-EU Thrust


By Tom Buerkle International Herald Tribune

LONDON - Assembling perhaps the broadest political coalition since Britain joined the European Union a generation ago, Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday began an all-party campaign to extol the benefits of EU membership and promote the Labour government's finely nuanced position on the euro.

The appearance of Mr. Blair and his foreign and Treasury secretaries on the same stage as two prominent pro-European Conservative politicians,Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, and the Liberal Democratic leader, Charles Kennedy, was an extraordinary event that underscored Europe as probably the defining political issue in Britain today.

With William Hague, the Conservative leader, under increasing fire within his own party for having hardened his skeptical stance toward Europe last week, Mr. Blair sought to exploit the opposition's divisions.

He labeled Mr. Hague an extremist flirting with withdrawal from the European Union and contended that EU membership was a ''patriotic cause'' vital for British jobs, investment and influence in the world.

''To be part of Europe is in the British national interest,'' Mr. Blair said at the inauguration of a cross-party lobbying group called Britain in Europe. ''The people here represent a patriotic alliance that puts country before party.''

Mr. Heseltine, a former deputy leader of the Conservative Party, sought to contrast Mr. Hague's Euro-skeptic attitude with the pro-European policies of former Tory leaders like Edward Heath, who led Britain into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, and Margaret Thatcher, who signed the 1986 act that created Europe's single market.

"Each weighed our national self-interest and took us further, deeper and more irrevocably towards that vision'' of European integration first sketched out by Winston Churchill after World War II, he said.

He also gibed at Mrs. Thatcher, who whipped up Conservative skepticism last week by saying that all Britain's problems had come from mainland Europe. ''You can't wield a handbag from an empty chair,'' Mr. Heseltine said.

But for all the rhetoric, it was a measure of Mr. Blair's own hesitations and conservative instincts that he carefully avoided any suggestion of campaigning to join the euro, which was the original purpose for forming the Britain in Europe group. He simply reiterated that he favored the euro in principle but would make British entry conditional on several economic tests laid down by the government two years ago.

That was ''a sensible position,'' he said, while Mr. Hague's promise to rule out joining the euro in the next Parliament, and perhaps even longer, verged on ''madness.''

Mr. Hague accused Mr. Blair of hiding his real intention to abolish the pound. In an article in The Times, he promised to step up the Conservative campaign to keep the pound and to renegotiate EU treaties to allow countries to opt out of future policies. ''The battle for the soul of our country
has begun,'' he wrote.

In the short run, Mr. Blair should have little difficulty in maintaining a pro-Europe stance without becoming pro-euro. Mr. Hague's stridency and the growing opposition to it from Conservatives like former Prime Minister John Major and Britain's EU commissioner, Chris Patten, threaten to split the party or narrow its appeal to a nationalist core.

Mr. Heseltine said he saw ''some similarities'' between the Conservative turmoil over Europe today and the divisions over nuclear disarmament and nationalization that split the Labour Party in the early 1980s.

''The Conservatives are a party in the throes of a nervous breakdown,'' The Guardian said in an editorial.

''Not since the gang of four broke from Labour has a party witnessed such passionate dissent voiced, in concert, at such a level,'' it said, referring to the establishment of the Social Democratic Party by disenchanted Labour politicians in 1981.

In the longer run, however, many politicians and business leaders believe Mr. Blair will have to give a clearer commitment to the euro or risk seeing the prospects for entry recede. Some pro-euro Labour members believe it will be difficult to call and win a referendum on the euro early in the next Parliament if Mr. Blair continues to sit on the fence in the next general election, which must be called by May 2002.

Major companies also will need a clearer signal from the government in ''months, not years,'' before they will invest to prepare for the euro, said Graham Bishop, an economist at the brokerage firm Salomon Smith Barney.

But, I do have close access to some very interesting simi-traders that, for lack of a better term, "trade the dealers".

There is some talk that a "logjam" of sorts was broken yesterday. I think we will break "massively" to new highs, then pause for a while. This is the current assessment

Look for all the currencies to run against the dollar, big time, especially the most heavily used "carry", the yen. The run to safety will see the Euro first (as the dollar will be sold for position squaring), followed by gold. Physical gold being the most lopsided carry instrument, will be in major demand. Mostly physical because this crisis will immobilize most "bookkeeping" hedges. THis run should continue for some

Yellin' of troy (10/15/99; 13:03:53MDT - Msg ID:16465)
FOA -- the demand for gold is not insatiable

-----What you are missing is the distinction between wealth and money. ---------

Oh Yellin of Troy,
Your modern thesis comes from a viewpoint that wealth and money are different. I had the same debate with Martin Armstrong. His whole basis for de-wealthing gold was built upon the modern man concepts and how he stood higher than his brethren of old. From the beginning man traded wealth, not money! We brought things with things and found little need for a different concept of wealth. Gold became the wealth item that was most efficient to use. It was only the modern (modern for that time) bankers that said it was money. Your modern paper started as a contract for wealth in storage, then proceded to become a digital receipt for the completion of commerce. Today, it no longer holds the title of contract and is failing in it's ability to effect digital trade.

--- And while there is certainly considerable benefit and joy in knowing that you *could* do something, isn't the value of having gold to spend much reduced if you not only never actually spend any of it but are bound and determined that you never will? -------------

Cross the globe many times my friend. During your travels observe how spend able gold has become in every nation on earth. It is an old wealth/money that still buys anything. Black market, white market or no market, one can exchange gold for currency privately or officially at any time and any place. There are some on this forum that like I have run the world and know this currency well. Your pronouncement that power can prevent a peoples from maintaining wealth and spending it in gold simply does not stand-up to history, past, present and no doubt future. Even when the US stopped gold usage, most of the world continued to use it. Some of my forefathers were also "against the law" in those times. Find me a better reason than supposition?

---Have you sold everything you own, turned it into gold, abandoned your family, and taken to living in the gutter with your bag of gold hidden in your underpants? If not, there are things you prefer to their price in gold. And I don't imagine your present holdings of non gold assets are
unimprovable; wouldn't you buy more if you were richer? Whatever your level of wealth, you only want some of it in gold. And even if you are an incredible miser who only wants to caress his gold, there's a limit to how much you can afford. You're not infinitely rich, and you can't get richer by forgoing your dinner and deodorant for gold, and your fairy godmother will not bring you free gold every day.---

Indeed, I must ask the same question, for it is not I or my friends that walk your alley trail. Our gold is for the preservation of wealth in a world that is lacking "contract honour". Truly, it is the future that we defend against, not the past. Every investor gains and maintains his winnings during the here and now, not the past. Default is before us, therefore protect the family by owning real wealth now. All of the great families of old brought freedom from failure using gold a part of their wealth. We doubt they considered it as their day to day money nor do I. Our times have changed that concept. You, and humanity will continue to use the digital currencies as money for needs. Just as in the
past, the difference between retaining what you have and giving up a good portion to the fraud of currency is gold!

----------- The key point, and the fact responsible for the wealth of the modern world, is that you can expend your money on *investments*. You can use some of your gold to build awidget factory, or buy one, or if you don't understand widgets you can be a passive shareholder or
a lender in an outfit run by somebody who does, or you can lend to a banker who knows how to find and oversee such people and will spread the risk.----

-----However you do it, you can expect to get back, eventually, more money more gold, if that's money or if you insist -- than you started with. The whole thrust of your argument was that there is no limit to how much money you dream of, you want as much as possible. But then, if you
have a huge stash of gold, more than you have any intention of spending, more than you could ever suddenly need to spend, why not apply some of it to getting more? If you would never refuse a free gift of gold, why refuse an offer of interest on gold sitting idle in your vault, for which you have no other present use (and derive no other benefit) anyway? The sensible thing to do is to keep on hand only as much money as you might actually need or want to spend (before the investments pay off)

-- this is your demand for money, and it is finite and indeed rather limited -- and direct the rest to where it will be most useful, most productive, most profitable. And the people you let have it aren't going to put it all in their vaults and just revel in its glitter -- how would they be able to pay you your interest? They need your money for expenses: They can't sell any widgets until well after they have paid a lot of suppliers, secretaries, and salesmen a lot of money. They do need to keep some cash on hand, but only some; their monetary needs are limited just like yours, except that they are trying to reduce outgoing interest payments instead of increase incoming. The secretaries don't put all their wages in the piggy bank, either; they spend most of it. No one's pile of yellow is a black hole; each
economic actor has only some limited target for cash on hand, and the sum of all these is some definite aggregate demand for money, not a bottomless pit.--------------

Oh Troy,
Again I say, the demand for money is unlimited! I never said that it would not "circulate"! Into the great economies of the future will flow our gold. Yet, we will lend it or spend at our choosing to buy things. Be they investments or pleasures our wealth in gold will circulate most freely. For every person that works 10 hours instead of 8, his two plus efforts will make demand for gold. So, how much is too much? The world has never seen this end and I hope it never does.

------Of course, if gold is grossly underpriced, it can be a very fine investment itself. If you believe others will soon come to understand its merits and correct its price upwards, then you can increase your buying power, your wealth, for the future by merely buying and (for a while) holding gold. In some circumstances this could be both safer and more profitable than that uncertain widget business. But this is a disequilibrium, a temporary condition, and the whole (expected) gain is in the correction. You can't perennially suppose that gold is on the verge of an upward surge that
somehow never happens; such expectations would be irrational and you wouldn't make any profits. --------

No, no! Gold is not grossly under priced, far from it. I say that gold is grossly under used! People have been defrauded into using paper as money instead of using gold as wealth in trade. How can the price be correct when no paper money can define wealth? No person knows the true wealth of gold. It's value will increase with usage in trade not trading it for gain. The true advantages we attain from gold are found in it's transformation in use. History has shown the most stable money was always gold itself, not the modern currencies. Paper will come and go as nations persist, but gold holds the value through it's own usage, not the digital numbers we give it today.


---- And of course gold is not totally secure: The price does fluctuate, the lock on the treasure chest can be shot off, and let's not forget that one of the great inflation's in history happened in gold and silver, after the Conquistadors. In fact, at the prices you are foreseeing, gold would be not only a low return, risky investment, but a risky, unstable money, susceptible to a near total crash -- see my post yesterday. So the wealth will go (mostly) into more productive uses than gold. This is a case where as soon as you are proven right you have to change your strategy. ------

As Another said, we only limit our view by choice as our feet place us on the mountain. Consider your alternatives during the time and space these events unfolded. In context, gold would have been the choice of most every actor in the play of history. We do not look for a return that is created by accepting risk, rather gold becomes wealth of "least risk" in a world gone mad. In every war weapons must be used. I look through the pages of time and order the timeless one, gold.

-------I won't deny that there are cultural influences at work here. If you live (or your ancestors, whose ways you follow, lived) in a country where invasions, political upheavals and injustices, pogroms, and similar unpleasantnesses must be expected, factories are too easily burned or confiscated, and you will prefer concentrated, universally saleable gold, which you can run with.---

Truly, a testimony of the time of the US civil war! Perhaps a time of confusion to be revisited, yet without war?

---If your society conceives of wealth as primarily something to display to show everyone (including yourself) how rich you are, gold will serve admirably. If, furthermore, commercial activity in general is felt to be less than honorable and "money-grubbing" is disdained in favor of status-grubbing, if interest in particular is considered sinful (even if evasions are routine), then the
daydream of heaping up illimitable gold will be a lot more popular than in a more Modern (and especially American) society.------

Your description of the USA today, no doubt. I have seen your country use it'd dollar currency in this very same fashion. All the while grinding the average citizen into a more lower position. Mostly they wear their gold in the form of a house too large and a car too expensive. All the while
forsaking the debts they build and can never repay.

-----But even Victor XXI had to spend his gold on paying his soldiers, without whom he wouldn't have kept it long, and had to borrow more. And a society like that, or a person like that, will be, in the long run, comparatively poor and unable to afford much gold.----------

My friend, life goes on with or without us. We will live out time in a manner that fate prescribes. Truly I have seen my destiny down this trail we walk. And travel it we shall, as a group or alone.

http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/00goldDXY.html
Once again I ask everyone to take a good look at the above chart. I offered it some days ago as a witness to what is about to take place. To date the dollar has fallen and US stocks have begun a revaluation that is far from over. Both of these trends will continue as the whole financial system
changes it's tools of valuing assets.

The gold chart shows no signs of falling as would have been the case in recent years. Yet everyone sees this recent slowdown in advancement as a sign that the BBs are again working the will of the CBs. They are not! Indeed, is the fall in lending rates a sign that fresh gold is being
supplied to cover the shorts? I tell you the lending arena of the gold market is frozen in loses.

Today the lease rates offer little direction because none of the major gold sellers have covered or intend to if they can help it. Yes many of the paper shorts have covered, but the thousands of tonnes of gold contracts have yet to be made whole for the "originator".

Is this how the game is played? Consider this as you watch the gold charts.

Two types of contracts exist in these numbers that will create the crisis. These are mixed in with "clean" deals. Yet they (90% of the short gold) create the real demand that will drive prices much higher unless the paper markets are sold into oblivion.

First, some are held by actual gold lenders (mostly private entities) that are now demanding a speedy end to these relationships. Mostly this gold was put "in play" not for the low returns but for the "fees and favours" bullion would generate. So, in order for these lenders to be made whole the gold must be purchased by the dealer in the open market or it must be borrowed from someone else to complete the transactions. The "BB dealers" have the option of arranging this return as able. Presently they are doing neither as they wait and assess the situation. This process is a game we now play as they wait for gold to fall and new supplies become available. All the while the lender
sweats his position.

Understandably, they fear for the return of their gold at all. If defaulted on, they will most likely receive a cash payment that theoretically could be used to replace their gold. Still, if this process begins, a mad rush to buy gold using "default payments" would telegraph a full crisis into the trading arena. Gold would soar long before any large portion of bullion could be brought.

Second, many contracts are outright "naked short" in that it's the contract creators responsibility to supply gold when the term ends. In this position, usually gold was never lent or sold into the marketplace. The deal was little more than a play on gold falling with the writer risking the firms capital to profit making the difference in the gold price. Often a long time physical holder brought his fully owned bullion into this play and received most of his cash back plus a contract to receive gold (unallocated??). His gold could be sold outright or held by the bank as partial reserves to cover the writing of many other "naked short" contracts. This was the real engine that sucked private gold into the "supply for fabrication" deficit. In the process paper gold was sold to drive the prices down. All of the new investment demand for gold was supplied using a glut of paper instead of physical gold. Unbelievable as it may seem this is where Another said years ago that gold was falling because so many people were buying it! What seemed nuts then is understandable today.

In any event, the holders of these contracts are the ones that will be demanding "allocation" as they withdraw their investment funds from the falling stock and financial markets. Just as above, the physical markets are so tight that in order to close these deals, gold must be borrowed. That is if lenders can be found!

Onward:

We have entered the largest gold bull market in history. The Major world central banks have made it extremely clear that this bull will run as never before. Michael Kosares pointed people to the WGC site for an explanation of the recent "agreement", yet no one must not have read it for
they still talk about CB and BB lending. People, it's not happening! This small lag in the price spike is only about shorts in major trouble trying to assess how they can bail out. Here is a partial breakdown of the parts we should grasp. See the site for a full write up.

http://www.gold.org/Gra/Pr/Wr991006.htm

World Gold Council Review of:
The Washington Central Banks Agreement on Gold 26 September 1999

--First, it is an explicit signed agreement among the European central banks, which goes well beyond earlier 'clarifications' about their gold holdings by central bank governors. -----
----it has been signed by each central bank governor, all of whom (except the Bank of England) have legal responsibility for their gold reserves.-----------

During the recent fall in the gold market nothing was said to clarify to the public. All of the "official deals" were done for political reasons. Read our USAGOLD HOF site for background. Once the Euro was born, the reasons to drop the price of gold were removed. However, during this entire, multiyear operation, an enormous "sideline play" of selling gold developed. These people never would openly give their reasons for "coat tailing" the fall in gold. None of them understood why gold was falling and still don't. We can understand why they continue to think gold will fall as
they have bet the bank on that outcome. The very ones in this sector are the same entities that will suffer the most as the IMF/dollar world is destroyed. For them it's going to be a double hardship.
Today, the ECB/BIS has "openly stated for all to see" that gold will fall no more! It is indeed interesting that we spent but a few months below $280 and will now zoom through $500 in no time at all. Note these next items:

--It is our understanding that the Agreement will be monitored by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).-----
---The International Monetary Fund and Bank for International Settlements are to abide by the 'spirit' of the agreement-----

Perfect!!!

---The US has already announced its intention not to sell or lend gold and Japan followed suit the day after the Agreement was announced.---------

The US had changed it's position on gold in the early spring of this year. Those that still think the US Fed is selling any form of gold short just do not understand how this market has changed. Waiting for the price to fall as "official sales" or "lending" confirm the recent price action will find you on the the outside of a bull market.

---In addition Australia has said it will not sell any more gold, and South Africa is unlikely to sell part of its reserves given the government's vehement opposition to the UK sales.-------
----bringing the total amount of official gold covered to 85%.--------

We have but to wait and watch as the pressure rises under the price of gold!

------We understand that the quotas are not transferable, i.e. if the Swiss decide not to sell 1300 tonnes in the next five years but instead only 1000 tonnes, then no other institution can sell the remaining 300 tonnes.--------

So, how does one prepare for the coming historic bull market in gold. Follow in the footsteps of the only correct Giant in South Africa. Read the Gold Fields report presented here in partial review":
http://news.24.com/English/Business/Companies/ENG_161017_727173_SEO.asp

---Gold Fields said on Friday it had completed the repurchase of its gold hedge (forward sales)
position.---------

---it seems inevitable to us that higher, if not much higher, gold prices are possible.----

---Gold Fields continues to hold approximately 660 000 ounces of rand-gold call options at an average strike price of R2 171 per ounce.---------

---Thompson commented: "At higher gold prices the restrictive impact on our balance sheet and the drag on earnings from a continued hedge position would limit our ability to make acquisitions and develop new deposits". ------------

I would say that these people must be the only truly progressive miners in the world. Not only did they buy physical gold at the BOE auction, they are "LONG" gold on contract! Other miners may have "bid low" to show suport, but only Gold Fields got real gold and now is long. They not
only understood where gold is going, they positioned their company as a private person should in protecting their estate. We can now most easily see the other hedged miners are trapped in the Bullion Bank web as they can do nothing. These companies will no doubt go down with the ship. If
they can not unwind their position today during a standing price, they will die during the coming run!.

With 85% of the official world gold holdings effectively blocked from lending and most all the private lenders wanting out of this game, how could any major forward seller close out? Price has nothing to do with it as the bullion will not be there for 5 years, if even then! These miners will now sit and watch as that gold chart (above) runs out of numbers on the upside. While everyone makes noise about how the market is still controlled to the downside, Bullion owners and Gold Fields will run with the wind of this historic "OFFICIAL" bull market. If only other miners would put on a Texas Hedge, at least there bookkeeping entries could benefit even if the bullion market cannot supply!

I can say with pleasure that the markets have become infinitely more interesting, and with no pleasure that they have perhaps become infinitely more dangerous. "Indeed, is the fall in lending rates a sign that fresh gold is being supplied to cover the shorts? I tell you the lending arena of the gold market is frozen in loses." --FOA 10/16/99

I agree with this, FOA. I think the lending rate is falling not because of a new supply of gold but because there are no takers. This gold carry trade is indeed locked up. I think many are losing their career positions over this debacle and many more are on the verge of losing their positions. The
proponents of gold sales, leasing et al are in the process of being severely discredited both in public and in the professional investment community due to its burdensome excesses -- excesses which could have severe repercussions with financial firms up and down Wall Street. ( I saw one report where it was rumoured that Goldman Sachs losses at the moment could be as high as $2 billion.) It appears to me that the gold carry trade battle is now over and all that remains is burying the corpses and removing the debris from the battlefield. There will be further attempts to drag these firms out of the fire, but when the day is done, I think the gold carry trade will be taken out of the
financial firm training manual and rendered a much deserved place in financial history books.--------
-----------------------------------

Hello MK,
Yes, I think we are in the middle of an extended workout. None of the BBs are in a rush to cover these (carry trade and other) bad loans because in doing so they must borrow gold to do it. There is no way they could bid the physical market. If they did it would completely dry up what
gold is supplying the retail markets. If they must return gold they must borrow to do it and create same problem in the lending arena. Their image is seen on the borrow side and the rates spike. We saw this recently. So they fall back into the financial workout mode and the rates relax.
The ECB/BIS really nailed this entire play to the wall. An entire industry was built on expanding the liquidity for international traders as our Washington officials looked on with approval. The top people knew why gold was originally (starting years ago) being taken down, yet they smiled as
these funds (and others) "coat tailed" the fall. And why not smile, these trades were using huge leverage to build (and support) the American market mania. The ECB said "enough is enough" earlier this year, but no one listened. I guess they thought these people (ECB) were nobodies? Then the BIS said they were going to cut it off short and the US asked for some time to work it out. Ha! They worked it out all right! Our treasury head watched them flood the gold paper onto
the markets like madmen.
What amazes me is that most of these "big inside" operators create the market and really didn't know why the original gold (and loan guarantees) was being supplied by the Euro arena. I always thought they did and their stories to clients about "CBs no longer using gold" was just a "good retail story". When the ECB and the BIS told Greenspan "it done", it hit these BBs like a nuclear blast! I don't think anyone yet understands that these people are now the sole backup for an entire asset class that cannot be made whole. On the surface, they may have to make good on 5 or 10 billion. But underneath, the ECB could crush them by running gold into the thousands. That's why I say "it's all over people", because this bull is going to run the equity of the dollar creating banks into the ground. And the US FED has no power to stop it. There is no way the US will use one ounce of it's gold to support a "banking crisis" if a "currency war" becomes the result! Some think that if we have one it's as bad as the other. They should study "currency war" history, preDollar!
The BBs can go for the ride slowly (and be controlled) or they can kill themselves by attempting to cover. What a master play this has been.
-------------------------------------------


--So FOA....This new gold market; it is a free market, yes?

--In the Robert Mundell speech for which Steve H provided a link, the laureate said as early as 1997 there would be a new gold market and that central banks would look to settling with gold at free market prices. He suggested that this would occur in the 21st century. Was it last year, the gave Prize was awarded to Black and Scholes -- and then LTCM -- where Scholes was employed --promptly went under water? Now Mundell wins the Nobel Prize while the gold carry trade
implodes. The former honed tools for statist economics; the latter honed tools for free currency and gold markets and a much-needed competitor for the dollar. One became the tools of the status quo; the other the tools for a new economy.----------- ----------------------

Boy,,,, Michael, I have to tell you, Mundell knew the story and no one listened! Now the whole Dollar/IMF system is in change and most of the nonEURO US trade partners have bet their entire economic society on a prosperous, buying American public. The next few years will be history to
remember. By the way, any thoughts on a "Britian in the EU"? (smile)

--------------------------------------

-----In talking with colleagues in the gold industry, the feeling is that it will be a long time before the Wall Street trading firms and mining companies sanction again something like the gold carry trade -- at least to the degree that it was utilized in the late 1990s. Perhaps this was a usable idea that had got out of control? There is little doubt that the European action with respect to gold,
sanctioned by Alan Greenspan who attended the Washington meeting, was aimed at the hedge funds and foreign exchange traders at the big banks. Leveraged trading was beginning to frustrate some nations' foreign policies and the mechanisms previously established to keep crisis situations from getting out of control. What good is it to try to save a country like Indonesia with fresh loans, stiff political and economic sanctions when hedge funds can easily destroy the Indonesian currency through derivative plays and leverage and undermine the intent of the international agencies. (Please don't construe from this that I back IMF actions during this Asian contagion lending crisis. I do not. I simply offer the foregoing as an explanation for the cb's actions.) So they acted to cut off the life-blood from the speculators -- the gold and yen carry trades.

The two pronged attack on the bullion banks, foreign exchange desks, hedge funds, et al co-incided with the latest jawboning by Alan Greenspan with respect to the stock market. He has to be getting a little fed up with being laughed at and ignored by the speculators whenever he warns
of the excesses in the equities markets. Perhaps now they will find out the central banks still have teeth?

This all goes hand in hand and marks a turning point. The financial world has changed in the last few weeks and I think the man on the street is just now finding out that something has happened. At the moment I can say with pleasure that the markets have become infinitely more interesting, and with no pleasure that they have perhaps become infinitely more dangerous.---------------
-----------------------

Dangerous is the right word, MK! Indeed, I did little more than "extend" my context into your "just written" perception. As events have unfolded we can clearly see what this gold market means to Euroland. Traders are busy trying to build a strategy to gain from a move in gold while the very trading arena they use may go up in smoke! I know that the BIS wants gold over $400. Yet, for the same reasons they didn't buy at $280 they don't have to buy physical now. The BIS is responsible for all gold movements between CBs, it's in their charter. Few know what they are doing untill after the fact. Today, they can let the BB "paper crunch" do their work for them. Soon. How fast it gets there will be determined by how the BBs can workout their problems. I suspect we will see rental rates rise each time one of them has to slice off some capital. When this process is wide open Another said he will be writing again (above $360 should do it). The changeover of oil to Euro settlement is the next area to discuss and I am intrested to follow how this ties with gold.

On another note:: With the EU recently (last week?) accepting South Africa into a "favoured nation" trade status, I suspect that any of the SA gold shares that survive this may be left alone (just a guess). The EU needs the SA minerals as much as oil and that country may become very important to them. We will watch as this all plays out.

Also to ALL::: Everyone is down on Bill Murphy for the wrong reasons. They don't have to do anything but continue to discuss this in public to be a huge success! What ever else can be done will indeed help more! Investors can and do think, read and hear much better than most advisors give
them credit for. With the "right insights", they will know to move their assets as events unfold. Walking assets have more impact than standing armies. So don't discount what GATA is doing.
From my perspective, most all mines will have a rough time (not only from hedges) in this new bull. If people keep reading GATA they will at least know to run from BB controlled shares as they will be the first hit. I always say, bullion first and foremost. But, human nature as it is, the biggest and most free mines are the next place to be. They won't run as bullion will later, but everyone can't
be totally in gold. It's a physics problem at these low values! So "GOOD WORK" Bill, I know the sweat is running on the other team!

The Euro Area: A New Monetary Colossus

PH, I trust you have been reading this gentleman lately. As one reads this entire article we can understand what "Yellin" cannot.
Paper gold may be sold down at anytime but in this new atmosphere of an Official physical gold bull, there paper bluff is being called. Did anyone witness the huge call on london today? Buy physical while you can get it under $360 as we will be there soon enough. Gold will outperform!

----------------------------

October 21, 1999. The Euro Area: A New Monetary Colossus

The 11 nations of the Euro Area have a total population of 290 million and a combined annual GDP of almost $7 trillion, comparing quite favorably in size to the United States with a population of 270 million and a GDP of $8.5 trillion. Impressive as these numbers are, they pale beside the monetary numbers. Source: IMF, International Financial Statistics, October 1999 (most figures for end of June 1999).

With over 400 million ounces (12,560 metric tons) of gold reserves, the EA has almost 1.4 ounces per person compared to 262 million ounces(8150 tons) equating to just under 1 ounce per person for the U. S. More importantly, with the equivalent of around $1350 of cash currency per person in circulation compared to more than $2000 for each American, the EA could provide a 40% gold cover for its currency outstanding (i.e., the combined total of all 11 national currencies outstanding) at less than $400/oz. The U. S., as I have noted before, would need a gold price in excess of $800/oz. to do the same thing. Total U. S. foreign exchange reserves are some $30 billion; those of the EA over $220 billion. And with a 1998 balance of payments surplus in excess of $120 billion, the EA is running trade surpluses almost as large as U. S. trade deficits.

The implications of these numbers are huge, particularly for anyone contemplating any sort of currency competition, let alone a possible currency war, between the Euro Area and the United States. What makes them even more frightening from the American perspective is the fact that Euro currency itself does not yet exist but must be introduced by January 1, 2002. Why?

One of the most intriguing questions about the U.S. dollar, or more precisely the 550 billion of them circulating in the world, is: where are they? No one really knows, but it seems almost certain that a great many of them circulate outside the country in parts of the world where the local currency is unreliable. Something of the same phenomonon is seen with the German mark, of which there are the equivalent of almost 1675 Euros (approx. US$ 1800) for every German, and even more spectacularly with the Swiss franc (over 4500 (approx. US$ 3000) per citizen, for each whom Switzerland also has gold reserves equal to almost 11.75 ounces before the currently proposed gold sales). On the other hand, Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands, taken together, have currency outstanding equal to about 1000 Euros (approx. US$1100) per citizen.

The problem with a currency held in large quantities outside its country of issuance, where it is legal tender, is its potential for causing destabilizing inflation in its home country should a large amount of it be repatriated suddenly, as might be caused for example by a sudden loss of confidence. Indeed, just this problem led to some discussion in Congress a few years ago about creating two dollars, one to circulate internally and one externally. The problem with such an idea, of course, is that even serious discussion of it can trigger the very consequences it seeks to forestall.

In this context, the planned issuance of Euro notes and associated elimination of national currencies, particularly the German mark, should hold some potential concern for the EMU. What is more, and even more importantly, the new Euro currency will have to earn and secure acceptance by citizens of the Euro Area. But look at the numbers. It is well within the realm of possibility: (1) to back the new Euro currency with a 40% gold cover, whether it is actually redeemable or not; and (2) to mop up all excess German marks and other EA national currencies circulating externally with EA dollar forex reserves. Indeed, what other use will there be for the bulk of these reserves? If the United States can get along with its gold and $30 billion of forex reserves, surely the EA -- with more gold as well as balance of payments surpluses -- can do the same. And however attached EA citizens may be to their old national currencies, a new Euro currency -- backed by gold -- might command not only monetary allegiance ("a Euro as good as gold") but also greater allegiance to the whole concept of a United States of Europe.

A simple message
http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/DXY.html
ALL: a few things to follow as this unfolds:


Dollar chart: (see above link) http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/DXY.html

We can look at the dollar chart today and see the the future. The US dollar has broken down and will continue this trend as the Euro becomes more accepted. Unlike times past, this trend will not stop. It will continue and in doing so impact every financial asset in Western hands.

US interest rates chart: http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/InterestRates.html

Once the trend of the dollar is clearly established it will force interest rates ever higher. This will happen well before any obvious inflation because this time the dollar isn't falling from inflation worries. This run is caused from competition. Even though rates are now on the upswing, they will rise even faster in an effort to keep the dollar from falling too fast. True, imported goods inflation
will drive rate worries also, but these perceptions will be "behind the curve" and "after the fact". Again, switching ones reserve holdings into another currency because it offers a better use function is a different kind of run "from" the dollar.
This new trend, created from a different concept will be the "wrecking ball" in the American economic system.

Gold chart: http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/GoldSilver.html

The new bull market in gold has begun. Large buyers of bullion should have already completed their trades some time ago. Indeed, most of the major players that are holding for the currency transition turmoil have been buying for several years. This past spring ended the "easy times" of bullion accumulation. All buying now (except for small private holdings) will be difficult if not risky.
It will be difficult if not impossible to trade physical bullion during the swings of this run. Even now selling the recent high to buy the current low offered a poor return over the dealer spreads. Truly, the risk will be found in the sudden spikes created as physical is brought to return loans. Add to that the rush to purchase by short term traders that makes it impossible to "buy under your last
sale".
Again, the price action will prove this is not a bullion trading market.

Gold stocks chart: http://www.decisionpoint.com/DailyCharts/XAU.html

The major shares did not lead the dynamics of this new market. Contrary to all the last 20 year history of gold shares, at best, they only kept up with gold bullion. To date, some have lost much more on this correction. The next major move up in bullion will lead the shares by an even wider margin. Some shares will fall away into legal proceedings as we run past $360 and $400. As this market works it's will, gold is destin to outperform all other investments by a wide margin. This market is not as before.
The above chart can be seen as adding silver to the list of fallen competitors. At best silver will struggle to attain it's recent high during gold's next rise. Eventually, gold will pass and much more than triple the dollar price of platinum. No other metal will be pursued as money like gold will during this transition.

Onward:

I have not offered such an outline before because the political turn had not materialized. It now has! True, the paper markets will work their effects on dollar pricing, but the now developing shortage will overwhelm even these areas. Leasing rates will rise and fall precipitously as trapped
players borrow to replace accounts. Then they will borrow again to replace those accounts, never able to fully escape as the price runs away. Eventually, the rental markets will stop from inactivity. Paper markets will stop from inability to match "street gold" prices.
So, read the above charts, not as a TA trader, rather as an asset holder that follows the breaking news. As this unfolds we will be glad to own, "only gold"!

Dear FOA
Your "wrecking ball" metaphor sounds ominous and unlike your previous references to "controlled burn" and to paraphrase from a more recent post; life will go on pretty much as normal or something like that. Can you explain please?

I almost detect a hint of glee. I must be mistaken. I agree we are in deep #@$%; but, devastation?

--------------------------------------------------



Hello Cavan Man,
I expect to see gold quickly running through $360 because that is the area a great many buyers began locking in forward gold. Don't confuse these with Comex or OTC deals. These were "long term" in nature and were but supplemental to substantial bullion already held. I think some of these "buys" are now in question of delivery. If this perception takes hold, real buying will ensue buy
these very persons that were to receive gold. It's mostly market dynamics at this point, because only a very small percentage of bullion can be purchased, out of the thousands of tonnes needed.
We will run well past $400, but I use this as the first area that the ECB would like gold to attain. The "controlled burn" comment should be applied to the gold markets. The ECB does not want to see a total run-away and will try to slow the gold rise. This comment is better applied to the Washington Agreement as that signed paper was really two statements that: (1.) applied to the need to sell gold in a future context (going out 5 years?). This would control the rise. (2.) The halt of the expansion of lending was what killed the current markets. Like fractional reserve currency inflation, stop the presses and banks fail. Therefore, stop the fractional gold lending and the market
"officially" changes!
The "wrecking ball" metaphor is applied to the world IMF/Dollar economic structure. Not so much the gold markets. Note the charts it applied to.

Welcome Scrappy,
I addressed the $30,000 concept a while back. It's more a projection taken during a study (I was not part of) that indicated just how much the dollar would lose "reserve use"! Truly, the price is unimportant as value assignment can take many forms at that stage of failure. Let's say, at least
$5,000 in the five years the ECB has allowed.
Yes, total change is a time consuming affair. Yet, it is longer than an eternity for investors that cannot recover in their lifetimes! The major story here, is the transition of currencies. Earlier, Another was pointing to the various political leverage that made this outcome proceed. Gold, being the historic world currency of "all" resort, will benefit from this transition in that it's use will greatly
expand! It's price in currency terms is meaningless as it's new value in today's modern world is made clear. No one knows where it will finally level out.
Truly, until the IMF/dollar pricing system fails, gold's paper price can run literally "anywhere" as the values indicated in dollar currency are completely false! As Another says, "time will prove this out".

Hello Steve,
Yes, "check"!! You better believe it. I have no knowledge of other counter moves until we at least pass $400. We might say that this is will be a "time out" period from play as some "taken players" are removed from the board. If the BBs persist in writing down the paper markets, against the "spirit" of the agreement, I would look for some serious international capital flows placed on bullion! The BIS has this responsibility and authority to make it so. We shall see!

FOA: two questions
Am I correct in understanding you to say that the street price of physical gold will runaway from the printed price of COMEX gold and other forms of paper gold until the authorities realize that the contracts don't mean anything anymore because they are not shadowing any tangible reality, and then the paper gold will quit trading?

Second, what political event has transpired to enable you to say: "I have not offered such an outline before because the political turn had not materialized. It now has!"?

Hello Gold Power,
Read the USAGOLD HOF (especially Mr. Holtzman). The whole point about contract paper gold being discounted is found in his post. Also read some historic accounts about the events that transpired during the Hunt silver affair. I clarify today's future this way:

When the day comes that 150,000 Comex contract longs ask for delivery, it will not happen! Truly, it will never get that close. In the event of a disorderly market, the exchange already has in it's articles the power to declare "liquidation only trade" for cash settlement! That's means no new longs can enter, only close out.

Consider that the comex is the very smallest of the world gold arenas. If all the current bullion derivatives were to ask for delivery tomorrow, the world would be short some 500 million ounces. So, use your best imagination when looking down the long road before us.

Kilroy,
Stand strong in your beliefs, for in large numbers we find agreement. And in full agreement we reach accepted conclusions. Yet, reason states that reality is the strongest of all conclusions. And reality arrives on the rarest of occasions, when mostly the few accept it.
The history of the world is filled with common perceptions that lasted for lifetimes. Only the few are fortunate enough to experience "massive change" against the established way. For the mind it is an experience to behold. For the pocketbook it becomes an expensive lesson.

Follow your spirit, my friend,,,,,,,, and we will meet the future down the road,,,,,,,down the road to $30,000

Would I be right in saying that the many people who do hold
long contracts would be "unlucky" to loose their investment
ie there will be a cash settlement/guarantee regime put in
place that is likely to return them their capital plus
prof accrued until when the plug is pulled.?

Hello Netking,
They can print all the cash necessary to cover everyone. But, they can't print any more bullion! Will the cash cover everyone's gains? This question is aimed at only the longs. It takes a short and a long position to create a contract. If they cover the longs + profits, will they cover the shorts + loses? It was a big mess the last time this happened and it will be bigger this time.
Note: Usually, the market makers of paper exchanges are protected so as to at least keep the exchange alive. Again, this can involve "liquidation only settlement" that favours a crashing price. (See the silver history line) Because bullion is not used, it impacts the accounts of the players, not the supply and demand in the physical dealer markets. Even so, many dealers do use the paper games to carry inventory? What will happen in such a convoluted mess? I say total market shutdown!

Question for FOA
--You mentioned in your postings today that silver and platinum would greatly underperform gold inprice, yet I seem to remember from a posting of yours a few days ago something that implied that you were also holding physical silver and platinum.-----Do you think that holding silver and
platinum will prove useful in the coming times - just not as spectacularly useful as gold? Or, do you feel that if someone had the choice to be diversified in all three metals (albeit largely weighted in gold) versus holding only gold and nothing else, that the latter would be the better option? Thanks in advance for your comments. All the best to you.
STRAD



-----------------------------
Hello Strad,
Yes, I do own some silver, about 1% of holdings. I recently purchased some Platinum, 1/4%. These metals will rise a lot in the future. They just will not come anywhere close to the run gold will have as it is taken into it's new money asset image. These metals are held for use and have a
definite limit to their demand, subject to a higher price. No, gold will mostly not be circulated as money, just as stocks and bonds are not used to buy auto fuel at the station. However, physical gold will come into tremendous (unlimited) demand as it becomes a savings asset.

You can bet this deal was done "off market" at a loan rate much higher than 10%. Physical gold as the interest with "down line" attachments to "in ground gold". Along with Arabia in this "ASHANTI" workout points to what is really happening behind the screen. And some people thought everything was covered because rental rates were low! Don't believe it! The whole rental system is moving "offline" to hide the effects. We must ask, from who will they borrow the next time to repay this new loan? A trap that the "Washington Agreement" has closed.

KUWAIT TO DEPOSIT 79 TONNES OF GOLD WITH INTERNATIONAL FIRMS
Kuwait--Oct 21--Kuwait's Central Bank announced today that it had decided to deposit 79 tonnes of its gold reserves with "reputable" international finance institutions. Central bank governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said the bank would invest its gold through limited-term deposits, without giving up the ownership of the reserves. (Story .13467)

Leigh,
You assume the gold is being loaned into IMF/dollar players. I could be, yet it most likely is flowing through these BBs to cover an old Euro borrowed position. It is the ECB faction that has stopped further lending and could be repositioning to "self liquidating status". Again, the major
dollar BBs will get cover in this "controlled burn" if they agree to pay the "undisclosed rate" price.
This latest move shows just how much the deals are in trouble. It's obvious that most of the transactions are "off-line" because the lenders "announce" their intentions before the fact. Neither the Russians or Kuwait bid themselves a lower rate by publicly talking the deal. Rather they are asked to "Pre announce" so as to influence what is becoming a largely non investment bullion "retail lease market". Such an action telegraphs to the community that everything is OK.
Once these initial workouts are done, some of the players will be removed from the chess board and the "official bull" will run again. That is run until some more players are "taken".
We have but to buy physical (if you can get it) and watch the destruction.

One long post.
ALL:
I also read the article in Barron's offering Mr. Gartman's views. Thanks to poster "Number 6" for placing some of it here (also welcome to you, sir). It is indeed a benefit for all of us to find the gold story becoming more mainstream. Slowly the future effects of the ECB deal is sinking in. Still, I think most all established analyst are going to be very surprised at how this eventually plays out.

As gold begins it's rise, the numbers will verify to many traders that another bull market is intact. Each in their own way will attempt to gain from the price run. That is until the price starts to run "out of sight"! You see, the gold market began to change back in the late 80s and early 90s and that evolution has shaken everyone that followed it.

Too date anyone that has invested in gold using the "traditional" vehicles has been "dead wrong"! If I had to guess, it would not surprise me to find that 95% of these players have lost their shirts on a "net basis over 10 years". Even the shorts lost money as none of them saw gold ever falling so far. Often switching sides to catch the turn-a-round that never came.

Truly, investing in gold "as an industry" or "as a long leverage play" was not the game to be in recently nor will it be for the future. Because gold has entered a new era that will eventually find it being held as "private money" in the form of "real wealth". Something our "extended generation family" has never seen or understood. More on this in a minute.

Onward:

A very large group of world investors have been buying physical gold for many years. These people have been "dead right" on "their reasons" to buy gold. Another has said that "events will prove the wisdom of their ways". I agree with this even more so as real actions slowly prove their
assessment.

On the other hand a very broad spectrum of "gold bulls" can be seen on the side of the GATA group. They believed in gold as an inflation hedge and a good "supply / demand" investment situation. I'm sure most of them own bullion to some extent, but am guessing that most of their "working money" was involved on the industry side (gold shares). Truly, this segment of the community has found their investments on the wrong side of a political currency transition that was destine to change the gold markets for the rest of our lives.

Most everyone that analysed gold from a "dollar devaluation" standpoint was sure that gold (and the producing industry they brought into) would soar from such an event. Few could accept that for the dollar to fall from world reserve status would also require the total destruction of the "dollar paper gold market". Nor could they imagine how the years preceding this would see the world flooded with "dollar paper gold contracts". Yet, as this progressed over many years we saw how the political manipulation that GATA rightly exposes was being used in a way that will "eventually" destroy the confidence in the dollar. For truly, in today's world, if one loses the ability to contract for gold in us currency then the reasons for holding dollars at all begin to fade. From a country that runs a never ending trade balance deficit, foreign dollars and the interest they earn become a purposeless hold. If dollars can never flow on a "net" basis into the US in a trade surplus situation, the end result must be a bubble of dollars with no home or value.

Political currency war as seen in simple sequence:

Build a bubble within the dollar gold market by selling paper gold far and wide. By selling paper derivatives of gold we free up official and private physical stocks of bullion to quench the demand for coins, bars and fabrication deficit. Because the world gold market is priced in modern terms by "derivative contract", flood the paper market and drive the price lower. In an never ending circle, the market expands in ownership as the price falls.

"Coat Tail" this process on the IMF/Dollar need to lower gold to support it's currency with a low inflation perception and the political will to proceed is reinforced. For those major bullion buyers of the world (oil) that would object to this, build a new currency upon the standard of a future "free world" gold price that can become a trade settlement reserve item.

Once the "timeline" of the dollar is near the end of it's mathematical ability to expand world trade, destroy this "new fractional reserve gold market" by adopting "self liquidating rules" into the official sector lending game. With this turn, oil and gold prices begin a dollar rise from which there is no return. Eventually, the world gold markets, as built in dollar reserve contract terms can no longer function. As events slowly sink in, all foreign held dollars (mostly held in US treasury form) are liquidated from dollar terms by buying physical gold and Euros. For without contract gold, in functioning form, physical must eventually be bid at any price!

In real time production, we see this beginning in the US fed buying US treasuries almost everyday in an attempt to stop the rise in rates. A rise that comes without inflation. Truly, a rise that comes from "reserve currency competition".

Onward:

For today, the modern gold investor faces a dilemma in concept! None of them have ever seen a gold market that finds it's total demand coming from buying "physical gold" as a "wealth money" asset! Buying that arrives in official as well as private sources. In their (gold bugs) limited
experience with so called "free market gold" dating from 1975, physical gold buying was never the full price driver. The price always rose from, at best a 50/50 mix of paper leverage buying and physical buying.

Nor can they envision gold rising so much, so fast, even before dollar price inflation takes hold. Our total "real life" education about gold prices ($100 to $800) were all explained as "dollar price inflation" dynamics. Never was it approached as gold becoming a new parallel "private reserve
asset". Just like stocks, bonds and currencies.

Add to this, the very real prospects of their "gold price making markets" falling into complete turmoil and dysfunction. Every Western investor knows how to convert and spend their stock and bond portfolio. Yet, the concept of actually selling some personal gold to a private dealer, without an official quoted market, is seen as an "end time event".

Thoughts!

During the next five years, physical gold is going to outlast and out perform not only the current world derivative gold market, but outlive a large portion of the stockholders equity in most gold mines. During the "death throes" of the gold marketplace, the dollar price could be all over the map! Simply put, most short term traders and long term paper gold (gold stocks included) investors
will be eaten alive as we witness a transition unlike anything ever seen. How can one be ready for this? Some people are 80% gold bullion, 20% in the few largest unhedged mines (only 3 or 4 exist) and hold plenty of cash that is expected to devalue greatly. Their mindset is ready for gold to be priced somewhere between 0 and infinity! In other words, gold in their eyes will outlive it all.

Some writers do a wonderful job of proposing that gold is dead and holds little more use than a tradable commodity. The most eloquent poster, Mr.Yellin of Troy, has produced many fine articles that expound the current feelings of Western life as expressed in it's need and view of gold. Still, all of these concepts were built using the "American Experience" of the last hundred years or so. I submit that this has been little more than an "experiment in progress" that only now comes to completion. In the end, the laws of nature always control out destiny and the outcome is distilled into this common reality:

"The only real earthly wealth is one we touched in person as all honour is fleeting"

Further:

Is this how it works?

When a major Middle East oil producer lends it's last 79 tonne of gold into the marketplace, one should know he will get that gold back. After all they are not like you or I or the average globe trotting hedge fund. They are the oil producers for the next hundred years!
As I offered before, that gold was loaned for a "HUGE" concession that will never be made public. For the marketplace to approach them is indicative of the massive strains in the lending arena. Because these people will not lend "CHEAP"!
Understand the dynamics that are now in effect. Somewhere gold lenders and gold contract derivative holders are exercising the very limits of their "fine print" to get their gold back in "allocated form". As the brokers in between these deals have lost the ability to "control" their
counterparties, their firms must use their own capital to buy physical gold and blow up the price or "borrow" it in order to cover their old lenders. It's no contest and is done "off the retail lending market" so as to not gun the rental rates.
In the past, the news of 79 tonnes lent into the marketplace was an announcement of fresh supply to lower the gold price. Today, these announcements are for the purpose of replacing defaulted loans. It's important to understand that on an ongoing basis, these new loans do change
everything as the broker now must eventually cover this new loan "from it's own book".
The present fear is that gold lenders that cannot regain their bullion will start buying on the physical marketplace as they call their lawyers to discuss just compensation. This is the only kind of fear that will compel some "expensive deal making" with people that usually don't lend.

Also:

Every central bank in the world is looking at it's reserve dollar holdings and watching this latest gold spike. I can tell you that they are closely analysing this new risk because the potential exists to cut them out of the gold market at what was perceived low prices. As the Euro gains use, dollar reserves will become a huge dead liability. Especially if the BIS is stopping inter bank gold sales!
Truly, for China the risk is clear. I expect them to become more active in buying "defaulted gold commitments" that can function except for the lost margin, even if the price paid is much higher than market. The recent deal making by a large Arabian investor will lead the way.
In some ways this action is a precursor of a two tiered market for gold. With future delivered "higher priced street gold" taking the form of "defaulted new mine production". We shall see.

-----Kuwait is now lending their gold into the market, fully expecting to get all of this back. Isn't this just adding fuel to the fire? Where will the gold come from to pay this loan back if there isn't any gold to be had now? Do you see gold shorts eventually going to the comex type markets of the world trying to get gold from the other shorts of the world, or will they look elsewhere?------

Hello seeker,
Where will the gold come from? Well, we must know that these broad "official" announcements don't give the details of the transaction. Just as many gold mine (stock) owners are finding, a simple statement like "we are 30% hedged through 2004", doesn't really tell us what they did. There was a lot more to the transactions than the public report discloses.
The same is true with the entirety of the modern gold markets. Weather lending, leasing, forward selling or trading large scale OTC futures, puts and calls, our gold market is a complex network of interrelated commitments. For the most part we can just call it a huge derivative marketplace or paper gold for short.
The Kuwait 79 tonnes could be: (a) sold outright into the physical market (b) held on account for them in "allocated" form as they sign a contract to place the gold in "unallocated" form if needed (c) held in a BB account for the benefit of Kuwait as OTC puts and calls are balanced against the holdings (d) held in a BB account for the benefit of Kuwait as OTC future contracts for delivery are
written against the holdings (e) sold not on the street, but directly to the bank as the BB writes a derivative contract back to Kuwait for delivery (f) too many more to Offer??? My point is that the gold doesn't necessarily flow. Usually these deals are leveraged into paper gold many times
the actual amount.
However, that is not what this one was about. Somewhere in that maize of paper gold above, some lenders were saying "we will have our physical" "NOW"! So, as is usually the case when a business contract slips into the crisis stage, someone in the community gets a slice of their capital
taken off. The contract is filled at a big premium to market. I think we have seen (in the US news) how some of that premium was paid in this deal. Certainly, that was only part of it!
Back to your original question: If a crisis of supply erupts, Kuwait will get it's gold back because someone less important will be denied theirs! In other words, if two contracts are to be filled and gold is available for only one. The paper you hold will go without. Nothing new, as the world has worked this way from the beginning.
Seeker, You should read / learn / study more about how Comex works. They are not a gold warehouse, rather a paper gold hedging arena. If the world trading houses cannot fill an order, comex would be the last place to look for it.

The very largest ones that are not hedged. Preferably, they are also long gold! You know one I have mentioned. Truly, if one must play these stock papers, don't trade them. Expect the swings in the paper gold markets to price these mines all over the place until the market disintegrates! During this time these true "blue chip" mines will move far away from the others in price. However, bullion will still outperform the mines by a wide margin. No one is going to trade any kind of gold paper and come out with enough cash to net out more bullion than they started with. The dynamic of this bull is going to unnerve every paper trader that thinks they can make money against bullion. We have but to count the chips five years from now to see this truth. Until then we stand and watch this

Why will gold stocks be a risky place to be?

Hello elevator guy,
We have covered this area many times before. Simply put, when this new gold market runs as never before seen, shares will under perform bullion because they only represent the ownership of a business not money reserves. As a mining business, they must overcome the negative effects of a
banking crisis, massive cost inflation and taxes old and new. Their dividends will never return the equivalent of the increase in bullion nor will the equity. Most investors do not retain a good historical perspective between government confiscation and government regulation. Production
regulation and taxation are a different control of mine reserves that greatly impacts stock values. Many stock promoters often try to inject the "confiscation issue" as one for bullion holders while ignoring this other dynamic as it pertains to mine shares. The race will be for bullion and large international players will discount the leverage of mine reserves in terms of the crisis financial atmosphere they must invest in.
Even so, some mines will be sought after as they will be perceived as the best positioned of the lot and the last to be interfered with.

Anyway, it's a long hard subject that many will pay dearly for as this transition proceeds.

We will talk again on this. FOA

Gold will be, (is?) the only constant common denominator amongst the countries, as the value of goods and services changes with needs & desires.

The only currencies we have are I.O.U.'s. Will U.S. workers be paying off U.S. debt for the next century or two?

Hello Scrappy,
I think you are seeing some things in the right light. It would have helped if you could have lived in several other countries that carry major inflation's all the time. In this one could easily see how things are handled as your nations currency is destroyed. People do learn from others and survive the worst. It's always better if one can plan ahead!
This downturn for the dollar has been building for 20+ years. Some people say they have heard this all before and buying gold is just an old story. Well, the dollar currency has been inflated off the face of the earth during this 20+ years and it's comming price inflation will reflect that fact. The Euro is going to allow everyone to see just how much this currency has been over saved as an international reserve. Oil prices will lead the way because oil replaced the "dollar gold standard" in 76. Just as gold spiked when we went off that standard, oil will spike next as it moves to back the Euro. Physical gold will simply explode because no nation will try to stop it as this unfolds. Every
Western citizen has the right and obligation to retain their life savings against such changes and gold is the historical way we do it. Even so, one must be prepared to watch our modern gold price creating marketplace be destroyed during this process. Just as Germans of the old order were told
not to trust the Mark to show long term value, we must not trust the current gold price to indicate the value of gold.

Swimming in the Sea of Tranquility
Hi everyone. Found the briefest of moments to stop by before I must be dashing off again. Days like this are great--if you're not leveraged to your eyeballs on Gold derivatives or stocks, that is. When you've got simple metal, your emotions aren't all churned up when you see the price take a dive like today. In fact, it confirms better than anything else could the reality that the derivative markets are clearly setting the price for the physical markets. Nothing has changed worldwide--the ECB is utilizing Gold as their supreme reserve asset, at the Asian people are buying gold at a record pace. Price movements like this signify little other than the fact that the traders are selling paper Gold derivatives and essentially nobody is buying them. Hence, the price falls, and the physical gold gets snapped up that much faster by the rest of the world.

I expect that the typical American is holding out on Gold purchases until it is demonstrated that they will definately get a dollar-return on their investment. They will be in for a rude awakening. You can be sure that under the international currency strains of the day, the U.S. Government will do all that it can to prolong the illusion that the dollar is stronger than its true merits would allow. By the time the dollar turns sour like so much old milk, the physical Gold market will have been completely plundered while the gettin' was good by the rest of the world and the various Gold-hearts that frequent this excellent roundtable. Price-drops like today's simply demonstrate how out-of-whack the balance is, and the further off-balance, the sooner it all topples down. The more I see, the more I doubt there will be any warning before the Gold market as we know it seizes up and the world stands around until a free market can be sorted out. I doubt that during the transition anyone will be eager to part with their real Gold. Gold in hand is your only guarantee--meanwhile all others would be waiting for adjudication to reveal what their paper derivatives might entitle them a claim to...which might point them to nothing more than a bankrupt counterparty. We'll...at least I tried to warn you about going down that road.

The diversion of paper and physical??
-----The sheeple of western thinking know only one road, the one paved with paper. This path may see the price of gold go lower or even much lower. However, this is the road to ruin, a pot hole invested ride with each flat being reinflated with a fresh blast of paper.----------

Hello DD, I have a few comments to make on several areas. Your full post hit it right on the head. No matter how much we talk about it or events point in this direction, most investors just don't see the big picture. That is: "the international trading marketplace that represents and creates our present gold price is going to break down and eventually completely fail"! The death throes of this process can and will lead to increasingly violent swings in our world price of gold (the modern paper price). In like fashion the mining industry that is financially built upon the use of these modern derivative markets will also fluctuate violently. Perhaps to a greater degree!.

Anyone that has been reading USAGOLD discussions from the beginning understands why we have come to this juncture. We have been hiking this trail "of understanding" for some time. Looking forward we can visually follow that trail to see what must transpire. On one side, if the integrity of the dollar is "at risk" from a high gold price and Euro competition as a reserve currency, then the very members of the LBMA and the banks that own them are also "at risk". These financial giants are the "who's who" that the present dollar sector that the world economy is built upon.

This IMF / Dollar group is trying to keep it's gold marketplace "viable" because in it they can work their will on the price. Until recently, making gold "LOW" was a perceived common goal in world affairs as it supported the dollar not only in perception but with cheap oil settlement on "dollar terms". This year's successful birth of the Euro has cleared the fog and exposed a different presentation of European affairs. Euroland likes gold, marks it to the market and benefits from any increase in dollar price. All at the expense of dollar reserve perception. They would more than welcome the benefits of having the world market for oil settled in Euros and introducing the use of gold as a reserve settlement asset. The dynamics of this would create lower oil prices in Euros and a resulting Euroland economic expansion build on a solid world currency. Further, it would allow a world-wide super inflation of the dollar that would wipe the slate clean of overhanging dollar debt.

Now that the ECB / BIS has sanctioned a policy that must "deflate" the paper assets of our modern gold market, the players in this arena are battling an "inverse gold paper deflation". Having flooded the world market with paper gold contracts during this many year joint Euro / US effort, the London market is now facing the equivalent of a bank run. If everyone wanted their physical gold at once, there isn't enough to cover all the accounts. Official sales and lending will no longer back this "fractional reserve" paper gold market.

To keep the gold marketplace "viable", the dollar group must maintain the appearance of "contract credibility". The only way that can succeed is for the paper price of gold to fall. Because of the "derivative nature" of many modern gold accounts, a falling gold price cancels out the potential physical demand in many accounts. This doesn't stop the "run", but it at least moves their books towards a balanced direction.

If the price being paid to buy or borrow gold to cover contracts comes into full public view, it indicates just how far the market is out of line. The more visible the "cost to cover" becomes the greater the crisis of confidence and the more it inflames the "gold account holders". Yet, even today we can see the tell tail signs of manipulation "on the gold trail". The "paper market price" and the "real price to settle problem contracts" are not the same. Large blocks of gold are loaned by people that do not usually lend. Their reasons for entering the game are stated as "high lending rates" and "a good return on assets". Yet the public rates are far lower than during the crisis. Even the US military is seen delivering a "bonus" concession that I'm sure one could consider as part of a "return for lending". At least in the view of some people. In addition the BOE is rumoured to be acting to "settle the marketplace" by selling gold. What gold, who's gold and at what price did they obtain it? They have little left to "settle the market with" because of their sales and the crisis is created because no one can find physical at today's paper price. So they must borrow! By borrowing gold at a very expensive private rate they cover the true cost of physical from public eyes. Still, any additional gold borrowing to settle accounts, just creates a larger more expensive future physical demand that must be covered on their own books. Indeed, the difference in the cost of "problem gold" is comming into view. Read all of TownCrier Msg ID:17567 After the Close.

--" Ashanti's sanctioned change in mid-contract that would allow for "margin-free trading,"---

Thanks TC! If we accept their concept of a "margin free account", then one must agree that it became "margin-free" because the cost to cover that account with physical would have brought light to the true price of physical gold today. Even in the middle of all of this we can see just how "controlled" most mining operations are. (See TownCrier Msg ID:17567 After the Close)

-----New York--Oct 26--Battle Mountain Gold Co. said it has taken advantage of the rising market to hedge a total of 300,000 ounces of production for delivery-----

Truly, many mines are dependent upon the very "paper gold" market that keeps their product cheap! If they lose the marketplace (due to a spike in prices), their assets remain, yet their shareholders are wiped out.

Again, To keep the gold marketplace "viable", the dollar group must maintain the appearance of "contract credibility" at all costs. Yet, even in the face of this massive manipulation of a paper gold system the effective use of this marketplace is coming to an end. The "Washington Agreement" has made this a reality and the ECB has the political need to force a change in direction. Like a cork being forced lower into the water, the lower the paper price is pushed, the higher it goes as the next default takes hold. And default they will as no new official gold comes into this arena. Over and over again, the swings will occur until the perception of all "contract credibility" is destroyed. We will see $360, $400 and on, yet in-between we may see $100 or $200. In the end, a pure physical market will evolve that will take us into the many thousands. However, if you plan to ride the derivatives during this process, prepare to be wiped out. I and many others are almost entirely physical while some larger players are part into major / world class "clean" mine equity. We stand with no leverage and hold a mindset that sees $0 to infinity in the paper price as the gold marketplace is destroyed.

I challenge anyone to make this statement wrong: "At the end of five years, no trader will "net out" more wealth than one that holds simply gold coins (rare included) or bullion, Physical will outperform by a factor of ten"! Keep a fictional account on this forum and prove me wrong!

Physical, buy it while you can get it because one day it's production will be regulated. We are on the road to $30,000....................Thanks all for offering your personal thoughts, FOA

It's all here at the WGC site. Here are a few items.
----------------------------
We at the World Gold Council have christened it The Washington Agreement on Gold. I hope you will all also use this name.
------------------------------
On Sunday 26th September - just three weeks ago - a new era dawned for gold. For the first time in almost exactly 28 years, since convertibility of gold into US dollars for official holders was suspended on 15th August 1971, the governments with the largest gold holdings made a positive joint statement on gold.
-----------------------------
While the agreement is between European central banks, including the ECB, it was put together through the Group of Ten central bank governors who meet regularly in Basle on a monthly basis. It therefore has a broader dimension in that the United States and Japan have been at least present at the G10 discussions and in agreement with the spirit of the agreement.

-----------TOKYO, Oct 27 AFP - Investors scurried to snap up the yen today on news that Japanese authorities may upgrade an official forecast ---------

Hello Steve,
Don't know how many people have called for a weaker Yen over the last few months. Yet it still goes up. Even Dennis Gartman in this weeks Barrons is looking for the Yen to fall. I understood years ago that their economy is so tied to the US that their currency would lead them into a depression prior to the dollar falling away. Truly, their financial / economic system is so manipulated it makes our gold market look "Free"! Any country that can take it's rates down to 1/2% (or 0%) and still have a strong currency, is going to go into a major downturn. Usually a nation could inflate their way out of it and bring on a falling currency. Yet, their system is radically different as it was / is built as a suburb of the US. Any upturn brings then a higher Yen that chokes them back down. This very dynamic is the poison that is killing the Yen carry trade and by association is forcing the same funds to cover their gold carry. It's been going on from the summer and has accelerated after the Washington Agreement! All and all, another reason why the Yen will not be allowed to spear head a new pacific currency unit. I look for China to side with the Euroland system before it's all over. Let's watch this action play havoc with the US marketplace (not to mention the gold price).

Welcome Scrappy,
I addressed the $30,000 concept a while back. It's more a projection taken during a study (I was not part of) that indicated just how much the dollar would lose "reserve use"! Truly, the price is unimportant as value assignment can take many forms at that stage of failure. Let's say, at least $5,000 in the five years the ECB has allowed. Yes, total change is a time consuming affair. Yet, it is longer than an eternity for investors that cannot recover in their lifetimes! The major story here, is the transition of currencies. Earlier, Another was pointing to the various political leverage that made this outcome proceed. Gold, being the historic world currency of "all" resort, will benefit from this transition in that it's use will greatly expand! It's price in currency terms is meaningless as it's new value in today's modern world is made clear. No one knows where it will finally level out. Truly, until the IMF/dollar pricing system fails, gold's paper price can run literally "anywhere" as the values indicated in dollar currency are completely false! As Another says, "time will prove this out".

Stand strong in your beliefs, for in large numbers we find agreement. And in full agreement we reach accepted conclusions. Yet, reason states that reality is the strongest of all conclusions. And reality arrives on the rarest of occasions, when mostly the few accept it. The history of the world is filled with common perceptions that lasted for lifetimes.

Hello Michael,
It's interesting how they try to make it all go away. Yet, nothing has changed one bit! If anybody "cuts and runs" for real physical to cover, the price spikes again and the same problems appear. Up and down we go as a whole prodigy of BB players find they can only fight each other for position. In the end, investors in the usual gold market vehicles are whipped by the volatility. In the end, this contract gold market is repudiated into nothing but a huge court action. A new physical market will begin to appear as one of these sudden spikes takes us past $360 into the $400 range. Perhaps Hong Kong will be the new center for physical trade?

Seeing things from a different perspective
------------------
Outside North America, gold may make a sympathetic rise in relation to local currencies but not to the degree espoused by some in this forum. The only way that gold could move higher in relation to all currencies would be if there was a total collapse of all the major currencies at the same time. Judging by the way the ECB has rallied around gold by their declaration that it is an important component of their reserves, it seems to me that they're positioning the Euro to replace the dollar when the pigeons come home to roost. When the dollar takes the hit, OPEC isn't going to tie their oil to the dollar because it will be too unstable. They may want to tie it to gold but there isn't enough physical gold available to realistically make that a viable alternative. That leaves the Euro which, though not officially tied to gold, will nevertheless be proffered, and accepted, as the next best thing.

Hello Canuck Gold and welcome, In reply to your thoughts I say "fair enough", let's see how it works out. Tell me, why do you see that there is not enough gold around to become a "viable alternative"?

Thanks for your kind response to my question a few days ago. I remember the experience on other forums I often had wherein I'd ask a question and then have it go ignored. Very frustrating to say the least. Your willingness to answer our questions indicates what a gentleman you are. Today's question: If the POG goes up to that stratospheric height of $30,000 per oz why wouldn't the governments who need it merely confiscate all the buillion and coins held in private hands? I think I understand the difference between the paper price and the "street value" you mention but what good will a high "street value" of gold do if a person trying to use it will just get thrown in jail for hoarding? Am I missing something? Thanks in advance for enlightening me. BTW, I see that the POG has just spiked up considerably. Do you or anyone have news as towhy?

Hello Strad Master, Thanks for discussing and your compliment. How is your music these days? Tell me, I heard that the dry weather in LA can change the sounds from a Strad? Is that true? If you have time.

I think that most people read this ridiculous figure (30000) in present day context. True, today it isn't an issue. But place yourself in the popular perceptions of a future time. Gold will not be trading at these levels as "street gold" between US dealers or on an official physical Hong Kong market because "everyone is trying to unload it for cash"! Mostly, it will be a dollar problem as the US endures a major hyper inflation. Foreign dollar stocks held outside the US will be useless holdings, trapped from re-entering the US by foreign exchange controls. This is where the engine of "gold bidding" will get it's fuel. These dollars will circulate, round and round flowing through what free gold reserves are a available until the price runs outrageously. In this time, no government will be grabbing gold from it's citizens because it would be political suicide. Besides, the attitude will be "what's the worry, it's only a dollar price?" Get my drift?

I think you've missed my point regarding the intended Swiss gold sales. What I am asking, is why would the Swiss who I am sure are privy to similar information as FOA (because of their strong connections to the BIS)would want to sell any amount of gold Would you sell an asset if it was about to become as scarce as hens teeth and go through the roof
in price

---------------------------------------

Hello tg,

We walk for a while, yes?

The Swiss sale is a real complicated affair. There are several factions within their political framework, all working different agendas. If that's not complicated enough, these forces are interacting within the Euroland structure. So, what will be the eventual outcome and why did they
"do it"? Ha, Ha! You see this modern gold market is one huge "political chess game" and a good "international murder mystery" all tied into one.

Onward:

The Swiss economy is going to have a real problem operating within the shadow of a united Europe. With so much gold held as reserves, the franc, their currency, would become way overvalued as a trade settlement item outside the Euro arena. Yes, it would balance against the Euro well, but the Swiss Franc will never become the next world reserve holding. And that would creat a problem for them. It would be far easier to proceed into an EMU and establish themselves as a dominate financial leader within a Euroland structure. This would look to be a smart play, as some of their factions agree on this, especially so when gold makes it's initial run against all paper money, the Euro included. By converting a large portion of their gold (per the sell portion of the "Washington Agreement") into Euro reserve assets, they would still gain all the benefits of a gold
reserve that helps value a world reserve currency. And do this without killing their foreign trade (outside EMU) as continuing to use the franc would eventually do. We have to look at the direction Euroland is going to understand.

Look over here:

ORO, this is in the "for your eyes only" file.
Like this: Basically, the Euro structure is heading for
using the "free market" to value physical gold. By holding gold as a "free reserve asset" and not an actual "currency backing" asset, gold can be used in nation to nation trade settlement without damaging the money supply. In reality it is reborn as the true world class currency it always was
and independent of government treasury issues. Governments can manipulate a "paper gold" market, weather it's working as a "gold exchange standard" currency system or our present gold market. However they would not stand a prayer of a chance of working a world "free physical market". Especially the colossal "wealth money" reserve market gold would become at very high prices. In this respect it would dwarf the current trading of US treasury debt.

This is an enormous advantage over the old gold standards because, back then any country that ran a trade deficit found it's domestic money supply being drained. By treaty and international protocol if gold was shipped "outside", the local central bank had to drain cash or print "unbacked fiat" to cover the void. This process was required because each cash unit was backed by a fixed amount of bullion. The dollar at $35 / ounce as an example. This was suppose to tie the governments hands and force them to speed up or slow down the economy as the flow of gold dictated.

In reality, the in and out flow of gold worked havoc with national economies and produced boom and bust cycles. As above, rather than controlling the inflation of local currency supplies, the banks just printed money anyway and were later caught short the gold. Soon enough the
contraction arrived, even during an economic expansion built upon the real wealth of good productivity advancements. This rigid control, imparted by "fixing the gold price per currency unit" did not allow for a "higher gold price". Truly, as technological advances moved "real" GDP forward, gold should have reflected this "wealth gain" by rising somewhat in price and value as the local currency was static in price inflation. And this rise in price of gold should not have been viewed as a future price inflationary signal, as indeed it was so often the case. If gold was allowed
to rise, the currency was viewed as being devalued without taking into consideration that the local economy had produced greater domestic wealth using it's advancements. This was the main reason behind the political evolution away from gold money. Countries more so manipulated gold (even
into this day) as a way of protecting their currency values instead of working their money supply to match the technological and intellectual growth of their people and infrastructure.

Truly we see some of this demand today in the US. In spite of it's failing inflated dollars and the bloated world debt liabilities that come with it, investors attribute more value here than simple money policy could represent. A product of the modern need for digital settlement. Yes, if the currency is really hard, then production advances should "Lower" the local prices of things, not remain static. As such the fiat dollar is not "hard" and we have massive currency inflation hidden in static inflation indicators as the technological production advances cannot offer lower prices. Yet again, the need for an expanding digital currency to settle trade in this fast modern society is seen in the present demand for worthless fiat money. All of our modern advances would fail if we continue to use only digital currency without a "wealth money" trading in the background. This is /was so because there is no means to sepperate "good currency inflation" from "bad currency inflation" based upon modern advances. As such, a world reserve money based on the political needs of one society (the US), was abused as it purchased a local lifestyle based on debt, not hard work and good thinking.

Yes, a circulating "gold wealth money" will drive "fiat digital money" from circulation if they are denominated as the same. But, by allowing them to "compete" in free trade, gold would compliment the "Good" expanding digital currencies that are based upon "true economic advances".

Had money supply risen only nominally while the free trading gold price rose 2x nominally, purchasing power would have been retained in gold using it's old store of value function while the need for more digital currencies to transact advanced trade was utilized. Good inflation based on modern use! You see, our high tech world has given modern digital currencies an intrinsic value that gold, "trading in a gold standard" cannot represent today. As such they (digital currencies) must trade against physical gold in a format of the "Old World" wealth currency it used to be held for. Not be locked to each other.

Onward: for another view of the same mountain:

By allowing gold to seek it's historic money use value in a free physical market, it retains it's store of value function and use as an asset for some trade settlement, be it official international, commercial or private. In this function it still holds it's "honest weights and measures" (thanks Mr. Parks of Fame) use in evaluating national currencies. Of course it must regain a new natural money
price level first, but after that every currency will be measured by the economy that it's money represents to see if it is holding "advancing productivity value" by comparing it to gold. High speed computer trade settlement and the bookkeeping that follows it will still impart the need for digital currencies, but in this format they would be truly free to represent the economic dynamic of each nation. Even during a rising money supply, some currencies may advance in value.

Further:

For better or worse, this is the road ahead as the Euro becomes the first multinational digital money to be held in a "modern world" reserve currency system. No longer tied to the political pronouncements of one government as the needs and conflicts of many diverse peoples will be represented. Initially, gold will rise tremendously as it regains it's "wealth money" reserve function in the eyes of private and official sectors. It has been so long sense gold was really held independent of currencies as an international currency, it's rarity will require a "reprice" (or revalue) into the many thousands in current terms. As a "world wealth money" that returns from ancient times, the need and demand for
gold would be "unlimited". So too will be the use of gold as it must partially fill the voids of massive defaulted debts, inherent in our now failing dollar world.

This first run will be a benefit to Euroland as they will be called to cover the needs of many other nations that once depended on dollar based assets. But later, the world will have a reserve currency and gold to trade with and against each other. The Swiss must free up their gold by selling it for Euro reserves (in a round about way, I'm sure). In the end, weather they join the EMU or not, the ECB will eventually absorb most of the "need to sell gold" as stress becomes apparent. This settlement of many of the Euroland gold loans in Euros, will not in any way make gold less valuable. Indeed, it will keep gold liquid in the face of an initial "lock up" in contract settlement.
In the end, GATA will be proven right about the manipulated marketplace. I'm sure they will be in the middle of this as the court action begins. Still, all in all, it's strange how a new faction is now manipulating the marketplace into a "free status" to benefit them. What effect this will have on the gold mines located in the lands of the losers is another tail. We shall see.

tg, I hope this answers your question (smile)!

---------------------

Hello AL,
If you read my #17917 today, we get a picture of what is mostly before us. If you are new to the "goldbug game" it's to your advantage. Far too many "seasoned" players (traders included) are working this market with an eye on near term profits without considering it's powerful political and
currency potential. I bet MK knows this well from his many contacts. Just look at the ongoing "long money" destruction in the gold options markets. Truly, these gamblers do not know who they are dealing with. Yes they can move in and out with profits on the spikes, but they never tell us the "net
out" trade over years! Was it a sudden shift in jewellery supply and demand that stopped gold .50 short of $300 and my profits? Has to have been as no one can control gold! Oh right! One can get a better return at playing a paper game like blackjack with less risk.
As this "market destruction" process moves into better view, the swings and manipulation will only increase. Oh yes, just as in Rome with the last merchants still trying to convince the newcomers that there was unrealized value in local property; so too will options and future players
show us how to "work this move". Eventually, no one will play the game and it will end there with a whole world of investors trying to collect what they never had. Indeed, many will be happy to just get back what they had!
Just as in the past, some said that the future belonged to the dollar and not the British Pound. It's the same today with most of the developing nations seeing that the Euro has a much better future for their people than the current dollar system. It's all unspoken now, but later "visible walking assets" will create a clear trail. The actual proof is being driven home almost every day by the IMF dealings. Anyone that is plugged into the pulse of the "quiet crisis" that is out there knows where this is going.
To answer your question:
Here is how it was told to me: "If one wants to take advantage "after the war", he must be unleveraged in every way, today! Major currency transitions have a way of killing both long and short leveraged plays. No one wins in paper, not because they were right or wrong on direction, it's
because everyone runs from the marketplace. For local Americans physical gold will be the very best even if it eventually attracts a higher tax rate than other investment classes. It will still "net out" well ahead of the pact. Holding Euros will only benefit if you are going to have a second house "outside" or are travelling the world. If you are substantial and want to invest in Euroland later, a
commercial account on the continent will do well."

All this talk about riots and blood in the streets if gold rises is rubbish! Gold will gravitate into another "competitive currency with a much higher value" just as the dollar competed against the mexican Peso.

Question for FOA
Hello from Peru, FOA. I will be quick and to the point. Over the last year or so, peruvian private pension funds have accumulated shares of a local unhedged gold producer to the point of making it the largest single equity holding in the whole fund. The strategy has worked out beautifully so far, as the returns have been great. However, in the past few weeks, your misgivings regarding the paper gold market have been nagging me relentlessly. Do you think it would be a good idea for the pension funds to lobby the local authorities and press for physical gold to be included as an
investment grade asset class ? Do you know of any similar experiences ? Thank you in advance. I have learned a lot from you and this Forum, even though I have not participated actively. I dropped by on times to reinforce some concepts learned over the last year or so.
\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`

Hello and welcome Atahualpa,
Are the pension funds part of or are important to the governments economic well being? If so they may already own "physical gold"! Get my drift? Truly, governments may make use of any advance in gold value by taxing the added value as it is mined. Perhaps returning the taxes as benefits to the local pension funds. Follow the recent Ashanti situation for direction.

Gold mines will be important to governments that are on the changing end of the Euro / Dollar action. It's a far easier political proposition to tax the mines for revenue as you placate the citizens by letting them own "savings gold". It's just the way the world works. Indeed, some countries may encourage mining "untaxed" as they tie themselves into a trade status with Euroland. The recent trade agreement between South Africa has all the earmarks of such a situation. By no means definite, it is encouraging.
Investors that now recognize the current gold market manipulations and still turn a blind eye to future gold mine regulations are in for "Another" rude awakening.

Thanks for discussing FOA

That's how it was in the U.S, too...in the late '70s. Only the cause was inflation (inflation/deflation...seems to have the same effect on the working man's paycheck). In those days (oil crisis days/skyrocketing gold and real-estate days), you got your paycheck and immediately spent it because, with prices going up every week, saved dollars would only buy less in the future.
------
I'm not just reminiscing. If a $30,000 price for gold is half gold going up and the other half dollar coming down, we're in for those days again...and maybe worse. Physical gold, silver, and maybe real estate (maybe some highly sought after antiques, art, numismatic items)...will be the only value holders again.

Hello Simply Me,
Yes, gold went from $35 to $850 or up 24 times. What you offer above was the result. So, what if gold rises some 30 times during the next five years? Same effect, no? I submit that this time, it will not go down again. In fact, it will rise further as the world elects a new reserve currency.
Will the US no longer protect it's interest in oil or other arenas if this happens? If they don't, someone else will and things will only be worse for the US economy. No, our current lifestyle has a long way to fall before it becomes "more normal". So you won't be able to buy your running shoes for $125, that are made in a 3rd world country for $5.
SteveH once said that I talk my pocketbook. Well, perhaps it's the more realistic position than "talking your current lifestyle"? Real life feelings of national peoples create the trends, not the paper opinions of traders. Let's watch how this works out "on real terms".

----Clearly, the case is clear that the aforementioned real underlying assets, including metal (gold), DO rely on the futures markets for price discovery.----
----------------------------
TC,
Everyone should read your entire post to grasp it's full impact. I took part of it to create an image.

Slowly, everyone is coming around to understanding how our gold markets got so far off track. The official determination of what constitutes "buying and selling gold" never started this way. In the beginning gold was wealth and people traded it as money. Jump ahead to the US timeline and we see currency a gold loan that didn't pay interest as it was the US dollar. You loaned your gold to the treasury and they gave you a contract stating that your metal was held until asked for. Your contract stated that 1/35 ounce of gold was owed you, on demand. Because no one asked for their
loan to be repaid, the treasury just kept creating more loan contracts even though there was not enough gold to repay with.
After this "gold loan scam" went bust around 1971, they went back to using real gold again. The government allowed trading in physical in the US just as it was done in the rest of the world prior to this event. Then someone used the gold fabrication industry as evidence of a "need" to create a US futures market so suppliers could paper hedge risk. No need to make the point that this paper market was of little need as the gold industry had worked well for thousands of years without it. Indeed, another form of gold derivatives was just born. The gold market was destine to evolve
again as the distinction between trading real bullion and betting against someone on the direction of the metal's price movements became one and the same. People accepted that a gold derivative was just as good as gold as the pre-1971 dollar was. We came full circle.

How could we now expect modern traders and investors to mentally see that our modern "gold derivatives" were not the same as bullion when they viewed Comex futures and options as buying real metal in paper form? Today, investors see the "intent to supply gold" (a short) as bullion in someone's warehouse. Conversely, they also see "the intent to buy gold" (a long) as the total purchase price in cash waiting in the buyers bank. Both of these perceptions are false conclusions that a leveraged contract is enforceable by law even if the collective total performance is impossible. Just as the US dollar could always cover some gold conversion demands, it's credibility was destroyed when full conversion was asked for. This is the same fuel that drives the paper gold markets today, as long as people ask for more new contracts replace old contracts the game physical supply perception works. In like form, just as currency inflation cannot stop as deflation will ensue, the inflation of modern gold paper cannot stop as a run on the vaults will result.

After the Washington Agreement we can see that this entire arena is a house of cards built in the middle of a political currency firestorm that will strain the credibility of these contracts to perform. Eventually, as these market contracts deflate the loans will fail as the physical product it's legally required to deliver cannot replace the total number of paper demands. This house is going to burn along with everyone (long and short) that's in it.

Further to your report:
-----------------------
---That is important to grasp (and is why we repeated it) because there is currently a disparity between the availability-vs-demand of real gold when compared to the abundant trading of "paper gold." When real gold can't be moved adequately at the "paper gold" pricing levels, there will be a sharp adjustment in which all hell breaks loose due to the global scale of the gold derivative markets. Read on...-----
----Traders said that rumours are circulating suggesting that central banks, especially the Bank of England, had been lending more gold to the market in the hope that lower lease rates would keep the prices down and help producers to cover positions.-----------
----With the Bank of England in the midst of a series of auctions, all circumstances and developments reveal clearly that their goal was not to garner the highest price for their gold...to convert a "sterile asset" into a great number of dollars, euros, and yen with which to draw interest.
First, you already know that gold can earn interest. Second, the pre-announcement of the sales was a sure-bet to shake the confidence of gold-holders with the hope of stemming demand and dropping the price. And third, now you see reports of them lending in the hope to lower lease rates,
which in turn is hoped to keep prices down. Does this sound like the actions of an entity that is looking out for an interest to gain the best possible return on an asset that is being auctioned? Say it with me now...."No!"-----
--------when the wheels come off of this gold derivative market, the only position you will want to have is gold in hand. The dollar itself will slide right along with spurious gold contracts as it will be the denominator of those failed contracts. Oh, sure, more dollars are better than fewer dollars; but gold in hand will be better than any amount of paper that tries to play as its suitable substitute.---

TC,
Someone is trying to keep perceptions going that real gold is in good supply, even if it is loaned gold. Look at MK's report:
---------------

MARKET REPORT(10/29/99):
------...Several weeks ago, gold bears cited the lifting of a Russian export tax on precious metals as good reason to sell the metal. That tax was extended for six months yesterday with no comment by the anti-gold group frequently quoted by the mainstream financial press.---------
------------------

Thanks Michael,
I posted right after that announcement that the Russians were the best gold traders in the world. Did anyone believe that they would Preanounce their lending gold so as to drive the lease rate down for their own loss? At that time the rates were way up as all the major players were still using
the public rates. They truly needed someone to scare some business into a "let's work this out privately position". The Russian statement did the trick as rates retreated, but it didn't cancel anyone's liabilities because no gold was loaned.

As TownCrier makes obvious, this huge paper market is in real stress and the signs are leaking out. Now look at the Cambior news as posted from SteveH #17867:

---------------------------
MONTREAL, Oct 29, 1999 ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Cambior Inc. ( "Cambior" ) announces that it has reduced its gold hedging position by 1.3 million ounces. This reduction, made with
a view to improving its aggregate hedging position, results from the purchase of one million ounces of gold ( the "Purchased Ounces" ) at an average price of approximately $300 per ounce and from the closing out by counterparties of other positions totalling 300,000 ounces. The one million ounce purchase was completed primarily through the bullion markets with the assistance of various parties to the recently executed standstill agreement ( the "Standstill
Agreement" ) among Cambior and its lenders and hedging counterparties ( collectively, the "Financial Parties" ) . The terms of the Standstill Agreement are summarized in a press release issued by Cambior on October 27, 1999. --------------------------

I have to ask the question: In today's context of what "gold is", does anyone know exactly what they did? Did they actually borrow that much physical gold to initially create this deal that went bad? If so was the money created as the "gold was sold for the loan" still waiting in a bank. If not, where did they get the cash to buy the new 1.3 +/- million ounces? Did the gold that was now purchased, come from a "new borrowed deal"? If so, who owes physical to who now? ---more from the SteveH post----
---------

The above mentioned purchase and close-outs are expected to generate a net crystallized liability for Cambior of approximately $33 million which will be reflected as a non-cash, pre-tax charge to earnings for a corresponding amount in Cambior's consolidated financial statements for
the third quarter.

Under the terms of the Standstill Agreement, the above-mentioned liability will be treated as a demand loan to Cambior by the Financial Parties. The determination of more specific repayment arrangements will form part of negotiations with the Financial Parties under the Standstill Agreement regarding the elaboration of a plan for the orderly fulfillment of Cambior's obligations to the
Financial Parties over time ( a "Definitive Plan" ) .
-----------------------

In the above, if a "net crystallized liability" is the same as the "liability will be treated as a demand loan to Cambior", then who covered the real gold cost and who is in debt now? Or was the first above statement
-------------
"from the purchase of one million ounces of gold ( the "Purchased Ounces" ) at an average price of approximately $300 per ounce"
----------------
just the buying of "paper gold ounces" to settle a physical problem with a new "bookkeeping problem"?

Truly, every investor should follow these deals gone bad and ask questions so as to understand what they are really doing. In the case of Cambior, I need someone to clarify it to me? If all the counterparties cannot clearly identify whether they are working to settle loans with "real physical
gold" purchased without liability, then investor assets may start walking. When someone says they covered a hedge, the company owners (stockholders) need to know if it was a paper hedge covered by trading more paper or was a new gold loan used by a broker to supply the cover.

Just as TC pointed out above, why does the gold price need to ne so low for the conclusions of contracts based on physical metal in good supply? Indeed, in a free market everyone must lose a little money on both sides, right? If it's not free, investors may just start walking from this whole paper arena and begin to buy only physical. Or is that the reason the major market makers are so quiet.

In the case of our modern gold markets, I ask the same question that Robert Redford asked in his movie "Three Days Of The Condor";
-------"Why is everyone so shy?".------------

Hi FOA. At last I have some time to flesh out my response. You wanted to know why I think there is not enough gold around for it to become a "viable alternative". I meant as payment for oil and I'm assuming you realised what I meant and we are talking about physical gold.
----------------
Hello Canuck Gold,
I was able to follow all of your reasoning and assumed you have read most of the background writing here about this subject. Still, there is one area that is making your calculations suspect.

Here in this part:
------(In my initial post, I made reference to the intrinsic value of gold. I also believe there is an intrinsic value for oil and I would find it hard to believe that the values of gold and oil could diverge to allow the ratio-----

CG,
I consider the "intrinsic value of gold" to be found in it's "demand usage" as "wealth money". Something no one has been able to observe in modern times. Today, gold is worth far more than the value of one man's suit, as is often proclaimed. Mr. PH in LA offered a fine post about this
some time back.
Considering the modern advances in today's world along with it's massive population, one must grasp the enormous "unlimited" demand gold would have if it became a "background currency". At such a price there would more than enough gold wealth to settle trade of all kinds.
In like concept, people settle debts using the wealth contained in their stocks all the time. They just don't spend them as money. We do not find anyone using them to buy gasoline.
Like this:

""How much for the fillup? Ok $25, let's see here. I have one Microsoft share in my wallet and two IBMs. Shoot, I didn't bring any smallcaps or penny shares to make change. How about if we just use this dollar digital currency, all right?""

You see intrinsic value is found in demand and demand is a function of use, need and the retention these functions demand. In many third world countries today we can find people using their local currency as a sub currency of the dollar held in the background. It's a demand precedent
already in place that demonstrates how the demand for gold will be created.
So, please recalculate your position using gold in the many thousands. I think it does work.

Thanks for the reply,,,,,,your thoughts are an education for me FOA

PH,
First, I didn't thank you for the compliment given me the other day because your support was too much. Truly, I'm not very tall (smile). Your reading and writing is more than enough. Thanks so much for all you do, my friend.

In the Saddle?
With 17 Bullion Banks being forced to fund standstill agreements from their own capital, you ask

-------"Now we see that they are seemingly back in the saddle again". ------

No, they are still on the ground. So too are many other deals that the public cannot see. Truly, the price of paper gold does indicate the structure it's built on. The dealers are now largely working a vacant market against themselves. I said all along that the marketplace could go way up or (as Another pointed out recently) way down in violent swings from paper plays. We will see $360 or $400 and perhaps $200 in between. It's all meaningless because the bullion that must eventually be used to fund the contracts is largely gone. They didn't offer new airstrip improvements in K land because gold was flowing so freely.
We are entering a completely new era in pricing gold, but first the old system must die. The XAU is evidence of this as it has returned all the way back to where this rally started. Strong equity values in the gold industry require a stable marketplace to price their product. The wisdom of sharp investors in the XAU is seeing a storm in the making. They will discount the business value of the mines as a result. Even the unhedged mines are sliding. Look at silver, it didn't even retain a small bit of this advance. Indeed, silver always tries to coat tail gold, but it can't ride this new beast today. Physical gold is the only way to retain wealth as this process proceeds. If long leverage
traders are lucky (and I hope they are) some event will break the system while it's on the next default spike. I did not think supplies would last for the small bullion trader, yet they still are available without a large premium? I would not count on that lasting much longer.
Anyone that isn't buying real gold and holding it until after this market fails, will be mentally whipped to death. It's that simple.
The ECB have cut the dollar gold marketplace off short. That did not mean they would jump in the middle of it and buy all of the LBMA paper gold so traders could be made whole! Why, pray tell would they do that? No, they will let the system cycle between "selling down paper and the
false price it represents" and "burning up each others capital with each new, more costly default"! Higher highs and lower lows, all occurring in an ever expanding crisis. Even watching as these market creators hold certain price levels as option expire to their advantage. That's how a paper contract market loses it's credibility until it completely fails. I suspect that reserve gold flows
between CB will be stopped as this gets more volatile.

Further:
Soon enough, we will look again at that chart I posted showing the dow, the dollar and gold. Soon enough, it too will begin to register the strains on the system. I think someone here posted that the dollar would rise with gold as Another (and I) once stated. No, those opportune days are
long gone, now. At best, the dollar will try to keep up with the Euro, but I doubt it.
So PH, what does one do when prices run wild? There is a whole theatre of players out there that will try to tame this beast. Let's watch the entertainment for a while.

We are on the road,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FOA

The lending gap that brought grief to gold

by ANTHONY HILTON City Editor

The turmoil in the gold market is a classic City row. Nothing is visible on top but the most furious and bitter dispute rages just below the surface. Occasionally it becomes more visible, as when yesterday three European gold producers wrote to the Financial Times demanding a statement from the Bank of England on its attitude to gold and the
gold market. The Bank typically had nothing in detail to say but it nevertheless is just the latest sign that producers of the yellow metal have become seriously fed up with those who prefer simply to deal in it.

It does appear that the degree of speculation in the gold futures markets had reached quite astonishing levels. The dealing report of the London bullion market for September, for example, says: 'The average net daily clearing turnover in London rose by 2% in September to 37.1 million ounces (1154 tonnes), the highest level this year.' In isolation that figure may not mean much, but when you remember that annual new mine production of gold is about 2500 tonnes a year, it means that total production of all the world's mines is sufficient to keep the market supplied for only about two and a half days (yes, days) of trading in the whole year.

Alchemists tried to turn base metal into gold. Modern-day rocket scientists seem to have turned it back into paper, or perhaps just an electronic blip on a screen. But by any measure this is a vast amount of derivatives trading to be supported on such a small physical base.

Perhaps to get more supply, but more likely just to turn a profit, most of the world's gold producers have been bounced by the financial community into selling their gold production forward, many on a quite heroic scale - not just Ashanti, which is now in trouble, but right across the industry.

The counterparties to these deals are financial institutions - some like Chase, which has doubled its position in the gold derivatives market in the past 18 months, some like Goldman Sachs, and some like Long-Term Capital, the hedge fund we were led to believe has been looking for safe
investments since its debacle last year in Russia.

What caused the turmoil in the market, therefore, was not the decision by the central banks a few weeks ago to stop selling gold. Rather it was their decision to stop lending gold that caused the huge rise in price and, of course, has left a large number of those short of the metal with no
mechanism to deliver on their commitments.

It is also increasingly clear that this problem is not going to go away and runs a lot deeper than any of the authorities are prepared to admit in public. These shenanigans have devastated the gold producers. There are also several financial institutions rapidly coming to wish they had never heard of the metal.

Economystery

What has surprised me in the falling-out between members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee is not that they should squabble about the use to be made of the Bank's resources but rather the fact that the Bank has well over 100 economists on its payroll for them to fight over.

With all the economists in financial houses, in pressure groups such as the CBI, in City boutiques, in organisations like the National Institute or the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and in the academic world, there is surely quite enough research already into the various aspects of Britain's economy. Particularly given the flakiness of the statistical data and surveys that provide the raw material from which this mountain of opinion is constructed.

Indeed, if the independent members of the MPC read even a tenth of what is routinely produced every month, it would so overwhelm them that they could not possibly harbour thoughts of adding still more bumf to the pile.

The one law of economics that seems to hold good whatever the circumstances is the law of diminishing returns. So if the Bank were to increase its complement of economists, the extra resource should not be expected to lead to a corresponding improvement in the quality of economic thinking. Indeed, one might even argue that if there were fewer economists feeding into the MPC it might make better decisions, and fewer of them.

------Gold has an immense above ground reserve compared to yearly production (about 60 years at current demand), as well as significant below ground reserves. Oil has little (maybe 6 months at best) above ground reserves. How does this fit your analysis? Poor old Solomon

Hello Solomon Weaver,
I enjoyed your item about the wood stove. (smile) Life is truly an on-going, longterm negotiated affair, no?

Please read all the items in the Usagold HOF, as in there is written your answer. When it comes to our worlds two modern economic reserves, gold and oil, the cost of production does not control their value. Nor do stockpiles have the major influence many traders interpret.

When the time is right, officials regulate the production of these items. The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) and OPEC for oil and The London Gold Pool and ECB for gold, are examples. We will eventually see the regulation of gold production in the form of output limits and taxing schemes. This will become official policy because the only to truly control oil is by controlling it's real price in gold. A deep subject for another time.
You mention: "Gold has an immense above ground reserve compared to yearly production (about 60 years at current demand)". Tell me, in today's paper gold marketplace, how does one know the true current physical demand? With LBMA trading some 250,000 tonnes a year (yes, it's true. You read it correctly!), if only a bit of that demand became physical due to a breakdown in the marketplace, your 60 years figure is wrong.
Solomon, current wisdom of our gold needs is running far behind the curve. Traders and investors are trying to surf a tiny swell while ignoring the sunammi in the distance.

While I was doing some stocking up, I had the chance to get a palette of rice...100 x 20 lb bags...so, a ton. Total cost, $500. It would have been easier to lose $3000 on a "long contract" in today's market...its all hedging anyway...well the moral of the story is if you want your back to make it through 3 cords of wood, try carrying a ton of rice into the house for training.
Poor old Solomon
-------------
The mention of the small cost involved in stocking up on a relatively huge amount of real goods compared with the amount of money someone might spend on gold futures speculation made this an obvious line of questioning. Hopefully, the answer is equally obvious.

If you have a reasonable expectation that rice will be in need at some point in the future, why on Earth would you waste this knowledge AND your financial resources on simple accumulation of physical rice? Wouldn't you be much better served to forego the physical rice purchace, and instead leverage your money through rice futures? You'd surely make a killing from the skyrocketing price when when the rice shortages became manifest.

And wouldn't it be great if you could leverage your efforts on a futures contract for firewood? You'd surely make another killing when everyone else is clamouring for firewood that was never chopped. Clearly, those multitudes must be idiots. There they'll be, paying a premium to obtain these rarest of commodities, when you knew all along that the smart money should get in early on these cheap futures.

And there you'll be, buying a little vinegar and oil to make a nice dressing with which to eat some of your paper profits as a salad, and burning your remaining paper profits for heat.

I would hope that the moral of this story is so obvious that it is unnecessary for me to iterate, but I will anyway, for fear that I've communicated the lesson less clearly than was my hope. MORAL: You may find to your dismay that the cash profits derived on an underlying real asset are a dismal substitute for the real thing. What is true for rice and firewood is true for Gold, too.

Hello Hermit Club,
It would be a long post indeed. I ask you to first find a reference book (there are many) that chronicles the great German money inflation. Then observe the recent and current news items about many of our Asian economies that were wrecked from price inflation.
The recent US inflation of the 70s was almost nothing of the scale of the real thing. Just review all that happened then and increase it by a factor of 3+++. Gasoline at $5.00? That is only the first easy level. It's almost that much in Europe now and they are better for it.

More in a few days?
Hello everyone! The best of the holiday season to all.

No, I am not gone for good. This started as time away and has become quite an involvement in the debate over world economics. There seems to be no such thing as a quiet period or place anymore. Have everyone's post's saved and hope to begin reading and making comments next week (if time allows).
Another has indicated he will write again as gold runs through $360 ! / ? I know some readers will take that to mean he will not post again (smile)! Rest assured that this market is only just beginning to demonstrate the realities of our time. Yet, if things continue changing at their current pace, some thinking will come out regardless. I expect we will see and feel Another's posts in a
different light soon.
Great writing, everyone! Thanks FOA

An eye for gold!
After all these days,,, did Another "time" the gold market correctly? No, not for traders he didn't! But, then again, his whole message and proposition was never for a traders mindset or time frame. Indeed, his direction was for simple savers, like you and me. As a conservative group, our
holdings represent the most long lasting, stable assets that presently exist. Such assets collected over a lifetime should not be lost to a world gone mad! Truly, Another's thoughts represent the values held in the old world. For many these are in competition for our hearts against the current facade of economic reality.

We now understand how short-lived the current misconception of money must be. Other fast paced modern investors have accepted that "money was never wealth" and paper currencies need not be real things to represent their savings. Lost on these "educated of the Western world" is the knowledge that "wealth in the form of real things" was the first thing humans traded. It was only later that someone labelled these things as money. As a people we once knew the special value of gold and held it beside our other tradable property. We held this gold more dearly because it made the best form of "tradable" wealth. In this context, it's demand will remain, as always, infinite. It mattered not if one had one ounce or one million ounces, as gold money was/is but a representation of the real tradable wealth you saved over a lifetime of work. How far must modern gold now climb as it is reintroduced to the world as a new "tradable money wealth"? As far as the unlimited
efforts of humanity!

Truly, as gold is once more used as "wealth money", this action will again impart an unlimited value for gold in use. The more we built and created, the greater the gold value must always be in the future. Neither time or new ideas have changed human nature as it seeks to run from the modern uses and valuations of "IOU" wealth. A wealth that was never as great as the dollar said it was. As a system it could never represent a lasting "wealth of nations" as held in the account of "common man". Gold will come pouring in to fill this void.

This coming new level of value for gold is the "proposition" Another presents. A concept that is now being embraced as "something new" for a failing economic system now based upon an over leveraged world reserve currency! Truly, the old ways will not fail those that see through our
modern money fog. Another once put it somewhat this way; Nothing has changed our need for real things as tradable items. And this earth is still round my friends. As I hold my gold for the money it is, traders will work all these markets as they must. With the speed of light they now circle the earth, only to find their future as but one step behind me!

Yes, Another once said that. Differently of course, but an incredible bit of insight it remains. I also accept that most "physical gold" savers will find themselves "many steps" ahead of the "Western trading community" as this plays out. This "long term gold accumulation" proposition was given some time ago, to induce conservative people to begin saving gold "now". At any dollar price, be it $600 or $10! Such direction was given in the face of unprecedented choices from where someone could make fortunes using our modern vehicles. Yet, through it all, the revaluation must
come as gold will return as money to represent all of this wealth many times over. For truly, all modern wealth will be directly or indirectly denominated in gold as our dollar reserve fails. To this end, the physical gold holder will stand "one step in wealth" ahead of every worldly paper trader. Weather they trade paper gold stocks or dow stocks, real estate deeds or CDs, in the end their paper winnings will compete with the spoils of all others of "Western thought". These "non physical owners" will seek to buy what gold they can at a price many will refuse to understand. If one made a million by paper investing, he will buy no more than a million in gold. Still, for every new buyer that wishes to escape the old paper world there will be the lowly physical buyer from the past who will already possess two million in gold.

You see, there is a world of difference between saving real money as a "wealth of ages" and trying to trade this world's "paper derivatives". The lasting wealth of physical gold does not have to be "converted" into real things prior to a currencies destruction. It already represents the new
holding everyone will want. The coming "Western" economic dislocation will devastate all forms of assets that are held in "contract ownership". Be they stocks (most gold stocks included), bonds, businesses or savings accounts, etc.; the loss of a major currency will consume most of the equity
these paper items represent. It has happened with every currency ever created and will happen again with our dollars.

So, the next time you read that someone lost their "bet on gold", remember, they lost because they made the wrong bet. Only a "bet" of "buying physical" over time represents the FOA/A true position.

Another recently said:

"The time? These years be right for ones who save gold. One good ear knows meaning of wind in trees. The leaves come down as seasons change. Fools see falling price of gold as "death of tree", they chase it's price as leaves on the ground. Know you all, it is the season that has died.
Time will prove all things. Ones of simple thought, such as I will save the wood, not the leaf as they buy the gold, not the price! Thank You Another

Notes
Hello everyone! This will be one of many posts I hope to offer this day. I'll be in and out, so my response will vary.

I suspect most of you have been in a casino at one or more times in your life. Perhaps a Bains in Monaco or one of the many in Las Vegas. It was years ago in one of these gambling establishments that an old gentleman once gave me an education about people. He invited me to sit down at his
private spot and observe life "on the edge". Here is what I learned. In some ways it can be seen as a parallel to investing in our modern gold market. I adapted it a little for today's thoughts and actions.

You can discover the most about someone's character when they are losing their money. To a lesser extent we can understand their feelings as they are winning. I watched and listened as one player was winning. He gave advice and addressed how his timing was absolutely to the point.

The short term winner:

" " "All right! I just made 50% on that investment and it took only five minutes. I've been doing this all night, so all you "want to be's" gather around and watch how it's done. Before long, I'll clean them out and be rich. If you watchers are smart, you'll catch my "developing record" as it points out that I know what I'm doing. Done this before, some years ago and I'll do it again. All you other players at this table, give up on those losing hands and follow my lead. As you can see this crowd is behind me, so I must know what I'm doing! " " "

My friend pointed out: This guy had indeed beat the house before and made a bundle. Even though the crown around him was growing large, none of them had watched his play last week, or last year, or five to ten years ago. He was cleaned out several times and will never get all his money
back. Just like our modern markets, the tables are rigged against him. He wins just enough to keep his hopes up. We cannot tell his record by watching the crowd. Watch the pit bosses (monsieur in some classy casinos) and the cameras instead, as they are "not" focused on him. The house isn't
worried about this type of player, doesn't care what he says and neither should we.

I watched an listened to a player who was losing. I also saw that the house cameras weren't on him either. He addresses his problems in a covert fashion by looking for flaws in others, even the quiet player next to him.

The "I would be right if everyone else wasn't so wrong" loser:

" " " When this thing turns the money will come rolling in. It's just that right now the cards are wrong, the house is wrong, the waitress is disturbing me. Mostly, it's the way this guy next to me is playing the game, that is throwing me off! No wonder I can't win with someone sitting next to me playing so conservatively. He even expects to make a chunk of money, if he ever bets. And has the
audacity to tell anyone that will listen! Hey, don't you know others are watching you! Your actions are affecting them as much as it is me? None of us can win if you keep playing that way. Look at this, not only are the cards coming up wrong, my gold stocks are going down again. Who do you think you are, sitting at this table with "professional" gamblers? Then there is that guy who keeps saying "I don't care, I'm betting more"! Is everybody watching this? No wonder this isn't working, these kinds of people are dragging us down." " "

My friend pointed out: He must be getting killed! Can't change his strategy because he only wants to play his "paper cards". Typical gambler; he wants to prove to everyone that they can win using the "house deck"! People like this keep the modern system going. If you think he is bad now, wait till the others start winning as his hand keeps folding. I've seen this before and it's best to move to a different table before his end comes.

Then there was the simple quiet one at the end of the table. He had not made anything, but his phones were tapped, mail monitored and weird people followed him at night. Six monsieurs stood watch on him as he played and the cameras were well focused on his game. Even though he talked
funny, a few people understood what this guy was about. His actions could bring down the house, even all of Monte Carlo! Clearly, something was very wrong with this picture. I walked to the table and talked. I was seen then as the only publicly known observer that knew of him.

" " " FOA: Sir, I see that your people keep bring in "golden chips" and stacking them on the table. For years, you just sit here and watched this pile grow. Still, you have yet to place a bet.

Another: My friend, I only bet when my play will win.

FOA: Sir, how can you win if you don't play the "paper cards" like everyone else?

Another: I do not intend to play the "rigged paper game of fools". I will bet but once.

FOA: Sir, Excuse me, but you have to play if you are going to win, no?

Another: I will bet only once and that will be enough.

FOA: But sir, how will you know when to bet?

Another: When the stakes are so large the house cannot afford to accept my wager. You see, I will play "my game" in "their house". In that day, in that time they will be the ones that fold. It be for the benefit of this new marketplace.

FOA: But how can you win if this house fails.

Another: Presently, this gaming house plays with their chips and their cards. Not real are these. This action has imparted the false value on the world money many use. The closing of this marketplace will impart a new value on my holdings and the holdings of all that know what is real.
The game I play is the game "ALL" win! It is "the good bet", yes?" " "

FOA: I get your drift, my friend. Let's stay in touch as I want to follow how the politics of this plays out.

Another: We watch this new gold market together, Yes?

FOA: Yes!" " "

My friend in the booth pointed out when I returned: Did you notice how he didn't get excited or mad as the value of his chips went up and down. That's because he is not betting yet. Everyone that hasn't taken the time to talk to him thinks he's nuts for building that chip pile. They think he is losing his shirt while waiting to bet. Still they are being taken to the cleaners as the "house politics" keeps
changing the card game right under their nose's. Don't think for one minute that this guy works alone. There is a huge amount riding on how this plays out. The rise and fall of nations are being bet on that very table. What a game of human interaction this is. All the other players at the table don't know that this old, little man controls whether they even have a card house to play in.Hope you enjoyed my view from this seat, FOA? "Yes I did. Hope to return in five or ten years, say 1999 or 2000, and visit again.

FOA, If I may....ask of you.... a few philosophical questions?
What gift is it, that allows us to see our mistakes clearly in retrospect, while we remaincompletely blind to them as we walk the path to distruction? Blind to the point of becoming angry, if someone dares question our present direction? Could it be that there are certain unalienable truths? Certain rules that guarantee consequences if broken? Is wisdom truly born from pain? If you are indeed wrong in your prognostications. I will not begrudge you for your error. I see that your frame of reference is not that of these present halycon days.


Hello Bonedaddy,

Halycon? Indeed, these times will seem as such.

-- Alky-one, the daughter of Aeolus (god of the wind) was sick over learning that her husband had been killed in a shipwreck. She threw herself into the ocean and was changed into a kingfisher! The Greeks figured that she built a nest on the sea, every year around the solstice. So, for a time
every year the seas were still"--

No, bonedaddy, the tranquil, halycon times we now experience will not last. Modern gold bugs search for financial refuge during these smooth times and find themselves in a tempest not of their making. They chase only the price of gold and find the ships they choose to sail upon being sunk on calm seas. In their anxiety about the future, they listen to the siren song of leverage. They board the very vessels that offer the least in stability. As Another points out, Westerners buy the price, not the
gold.

They see the trail we discuss and follow only half the map. Then, when the "price" of gold fails, they visit their bitter venom upon us. Not because we were wrong, but because they want to follow their old charts.

But, how does one talk to a group, yet address only a concept of simple spirit? Buy the gold and forget the price. The present marketplace for gold does not establish it's value, only it's dollar exchange rate.

We are "on the road". The process has begun. Many once solid BB's are in trouble from this first strike. The Europeans have withdrawn and left the marketplace to drown in a flurry of "paper gold IOUs"! Eventually, the larger scope of this political game will assert itself. That being the dragging down of the dollar from it's "reserve currency" perch. But, before that must come the end of our present price making system for gold. This destruction may show itself in many faces. Here is where the "old gold bugs" cannot quite grasp it.

One of the "unalienable truths" that you speak of is that one cannot own what he does not possess. The entire dollar/debt economy is built on the exact opposite of this concept. That being, "if you hold it in contract form, you possess it's "physical equivalent". This can be extrapolated to include US stocks, treasury debt and even dollars themselves. The American Experience says that one only need to hold the "right to buy something" for such to be counted as real wealth.

This wholesale acceptance of "fraudulent wealth" has lead an entire generation of "Western workers" into saving nothing and thinking it's something! Once any tiny part of this concept is broken, it will call into question the validity of the entire "paper asset" world. Break the gold market pricing system and you will break the dollar. Break the dollar and the complete dollar based business system is market to the market. A marking that brings currency pricing in line with "on the minute supply" of real things. Not the price of things I can get in six months. The resulting dollar inflation will wreck the ability of most businesses to function at a profit. The gold business included!

This is why our present dollar based gold market does not and will not accommodate gold investors outside the physical market. The Washington Agreement has unleashed a paper flurry of gold IOUs, all running from account to account. Running just ahead of the accountants before these
contracts are market to the market. The next "equity killing" gold run will soon destroy another batch of BB traders before the paper price plunges again. A vicious cycle that will continue with wider and wider swings. $100, $500 then $1,000 swings until the LBMA stops all fixings. All the while these moves will drain the equity premium from every mine stock until only the fully unheadged retain any value at all.

If you think our poster's comments were rough on me, wait until others start getting hit "Hard"! These people hate what we have to say because it destroys their investing world and therefore there professional record. As my friend said in my last post, ""Can't change his strategy because he
only wants to play his "paper cards". Typical gambler; he wants to prove to everyone that they can win using the "house deck"!"" I add that it's a deck rigged against most "gold industry" investors. Another said this long ago and he "WAS NOT WRONG". This entire industry and marketplace is
going to fail!

Bonedaddy, I offer a truth that most don't want to see publicly written. Not because of their concern for other's accounts, rather because it opens too many eyes! When all your money is on the wrong horse, you don't want to hear someone talking about how it's going to die. We shall see.

Question for FOA

Hello Leigh,
You know,,,,,,,, I have thought for some time that the whole issue of gold confiscation keeps being dragged out to serve special interest. It always comes across with background overtones of: "Americans don't need physical gold, so why bother with the worry". Usually the paper pushing brokerage industry and miming industry enjoy using this angle so as to sell their product.

Like this: " " "it's the foreigners that need the real gold anyway, so let's use their problems as they drive the market higher. That will benefit our paper gold holdings and we gain without thinking about government law changes" " "

See where I'm coming from? Truly, the last time the US called in gold, it was because they needed it to square "official bookkeeping" and create new banking reserves. This happened because we were on a "fixed gold price standard". Had we not been on this, they could have just raised the gold price to $100 without calling any in from the public. It would have achieved the same reserve effect. Honestly, foreign governments did not credit the dollar as worth more because the US robbed gold from someone to pay it's debts?

Then we have the precedent of 1971? Now why on earth would we now take gold from our citizens when we just denied delivering it against the dollar? Because, you say the new price today will be so much higher. Well, they could have marked their gold to $1,000 in 1971 and still not delivered it against dollars. It would have created the same reserve increase the IMF is doing today.

You see, the whole song and dance is about dollar supremacy. If in the near future the dollar reserve function is degraded, the US will have no reason to grab gold from anyone. Hell, they could mark what they already have, market to market. Say $8,000??? Those that run the US political
machine will be under the same gun as you and me. Just like a failing Russia, the leaders will be getting their hands on all the gold they can buy and shooting down all laws against
private ownership. Let's face it, they won't be able to ship it overseas (foreign exchange controls) so you can bet they will want a good free dealer market for physical: "right here in the go old USA for the benefit of the voting citizens ".

Leigh, the big Western money is going to run for physical as this unfolds and they will be paying up for it with inflated dollars. At prices none of us will understand.

My take on it,,,,,,,,,,,thanks FOA

"""these discussions should focus on sleuthing out the various intrigues of gold rather than the identities or moral character of other posters."""


To ALL:
I want to thank every person that has come out in support for "civil conversation". Thoughts can never be discussed in an atmosphere of disparagement and personal attacks. Human nature has always set us on the road to warfare without rules of conduct. My only open attack came in self defence after a departed poster accused me of "fraud" several times. Presently the Stranger displayed all the signs of using degrading remarks when intellect was in short supply. It's the old "I'll shout him down until he shut's up". This has surfaced several times. It will return again when least expected. Maybe it will be sent in someone else's direction and hurt their efforts equally?

We all post here at the expense of time and energy and no one wants to have "volunteer" work destroyed. Rules build a civil world and allow the thousands of lurkers at this site a good experience. I say, let him post through someone else or from under another computer site. Mine and Another's thoughts are free, simple and clean for each to interpret as they will. I have no need to remain and debate a rude person who makes commits at my expense. Especially on this stage.

Gold Marked to Market

Hello Lamprey and welcome,

The latest discussion I have received?

This IMF action was political money warfare at it's finest. The US faction fought for all they were worth to reverse this. It's a major blow! Even though the US dollar group still control the marketplace price for gold, they cannot stop the official revaluation of national holdings. Now that the IMF deal was forced through, these national holdings are free to be raised without "marketplace price settlement"! That is the key from which the ECB/BIS can spring gold higher in increments. It's also the reason the "Washington Agreement" seemingly came out of nowhere so as
to free European gold away from the English marketplace.

If you have followed this discussion here, you know how sensitive the books of the LBMA are to a rising gold price. Now the IMF deal has opened the door to a world with two prices of gold. In time, as reserve requirements demand higher than market prices, the ECB will begin to do their
quarterly gold revaluation using official gold prices instead of the fictional "dollar paper price".

Between now and then, paper lease rates, comex open interest and paper gold prices will be all over the map. The paper price could run to $500 next week and sink back. Or run and keep running. This is the undercurrent that has the BBs in hot water. There are some serious issues of "who's side are we going to go with" being discussed right now. If gold is forced up, it will bring the oil producers to settle in Euros so as to benefit their contracts. These contracts are dead without the Euro group. I believe this is the enticement that a Euro at par is offering. A clean transition before the fact. We shall see.

Who would have ever thought a small ME country's 79 tonnes were so important to the survival of the LBMA? Yes, they got a good return of military commitments for their lending gold, but that 79 tonne was nothing compared to the contract loss if the markets failed before they fully integrated with Europe.
Indeed, we shall see!

Lamprey,
That W. Buffet is something else, isn't he! No one has ever played modern paper market investing as well. I think (I THINK!) he even converted he silver holdings into lending contracts. Perhaps that was his intent from the beginning. Because his holding strategy is so public, buying hard silver cheap and then lending it for "who knows what" return looked good for his profile. With the market in a squeeze after his "news break" he could have got 20% to lend it??? Again, that's just like his kind of deal.

All in all,,,,,one day, Berkshire will buy some gold to hedge their massive portfolio against international investment barriers (if they haven't brought it already). Not even they can ignore this as a risk from a market meltdown. You can bet that when that time comes, this gold will not be lent.

Every day that goes by, the Dow Stock market looks more and more like the old Japan bubble. Only they didn't have a world reserve currency to worry about. When the US bubble blows, every asset holder outside the Euro zone will be running for cover. It's not going to be nice.

On the subject of physical metal; not all Asians run from gold stocks. Some of the major investment families over there own claims as private companies. Only they market the gold to themselves as they see the bullion itself as the value, not the possible earnings of the company. Big
difference from our concept, no?

Questions:
Do you have any ideas as to what is going on in the LBMA? ----------------------
So, if that is the case, who is doing all this trading? And why? I may be missing a lot of important information, much of it may even be obvious, but I see no other explanation than that the LBMA is a dollar/gold laundering machine. ------------------------------

Hello Lafisrap,
"a dollar/gold laundering machine",,,,,Ha Ha! Good lord, I think you have it! No, seriously they do move a lot of gold. Only most people have the wrong concept of what moving gold is all about. On the retail side they mostly set up a lot of the "big" trades of gold from the mines to the
fabrication industry. They also move any physical needed to cover the industry deficit. And a lot of investment physical is shipped all over the world. Still, all of this is but a drop in the oil barrel compared to what they trade.

Practically all the fully paid for investment physical is traded without movement. Just the ownership is transferred. For what it's worth, even this small amount dwarfs the new bullion coin sales world-wide. To me this demonstrates why fresh (new) coin market sales cannot move the physical price. It does make an excellent indicator of private physical purchase intentions. Usually if coin sales are up, most likely large physical bullion is in demand also. But, coin fabrication is small compared to bullion.

Earlier this year, old bullion supply dried up and it looked like the last of the private "old stocks of gold" had finally run out. Then the price shock from the Washington Agreement flushed out some more. I've written on this before (and ORO told it better than I), but the more the old holders sell out in return for holding "unallocated gold accounts" the worse the shortage will be when the
marketplace fails. Slowly, over many years, the people that now hold the real bullion that was sold to create a lot of paper gold, have literally locked up the ownership. The old liquid gold market we used to know in years past functioned because of all the private physical holders that traded it.
Now, it's all paper being shuffled around.

This gets back to your LBMA item. The old, deep private bullion pool has been replaced with a paper commitment pool. In the past, if someone defaulted, we just grabbed their bullion. Today, if they default, they just default! Again, if that big African mine does tell them to take a hike, the
whole modern gold market could just collapse. This is why I smile when I hear someone question why the big funds and traders don't just take delivery against OTC paper. The question is just exactly what are they going to take delivery of?
All the gold movement is just for show. Same for comex. Sock a little gold in there and complete a few deliveries so it all looks right. It's all the same game we played with the dollar before 1971. Only when everyone asked for delivery did we find out that the world was awash in paper gold,,,,,I mean dollars! It's going to happen again, real soon.

-------------I have read that there is a world drug trade that is extremely large and traces back to the British East Indies Company, and this world-wide drug trade still flourishes, using much gold that must be laundered into dollars. ------

------Also, what is "market to market"? I am guessing you mean "marked to market". That means to price something at the price the market will pay, correct? ------------

Lafisrap,
As for drug money in gold? Shoot, I bet more illegal trade of everything is done in US dollars than gold. From what the Government tells us about the new copy machines now-a-days, they don't need to break into banks any more! They just print the stuff?? What a mess!
Sorry, Market to Market is a slang. You are correct.

Any flaw in this script?

Hello Peter,
That could be right. There are several angles floating around. Your thought would make the best play for silver longs. Don't forget, I own a little silver,,,none of you would talk to me if I didn't (smile).
Anyway, tightening screws is not the Buffet profile. My take is that he brought long before $7.00. The price run started because committed traders knew his announcement was a threat to their hedged plays. You know, deltas all out of whack. The price worked it's way back down after he leased high (10%, 15%, 20%???) as commercials pulled their emergency long trades.
In reality, the silver he locked down was already in use, so to speak. It was held as a function of inventory. So, all he did was lock a claim on the inventory metal, then contract it's ownership back for a fixed time. All the while receiving ransom money. It fit's perfectly because that's the same play he uses to grab preferred stock of companies. If the collateral goes up in value, that's good. But, his
aim is a higher return than "market" and be first in line in ownership.
He would do the same thing using Iron if the rates were right.

1. In Don Coxe's weekly conference call, reference was made to some agreement or proposalwhereby "two zeros" will be dropped off the Japanese currency. This forms part of the "parity" notion - that one US dollar will equal one Euro will equal one yen.

Hello canamami,
Ok, fair enough, I'll take this a little at a time.
In this context we back out the flows of equity investment motives and look only at currency derivatives as official treasury debt held in lieu of cash. US debt is held in foreign countries by two classes. Some of it is private (mutual funds, citizens and companies doing dollar based business) and government (official Central Bank). Usually, the private holdings are done because someone has an idea (right or wrong) about the direction of their local currency values and interest rates (yen, Marks, Euros). Just like you and I, they may want to diversify their assets. "In times past", for every foreign buyer of US cash, their was a local (US) citizen that for the same reasons, wanted to diversify outside of the US. So they kind of balanced this flow and this action did not impact balance of trade accounts. Again, we are talking about cash flows for the sake of owning savings, not any form of equity flows.

In the private sector, it was always the business trade that built up excess dollars as they sold more "goods" to the US for dollars than the US businesses sold to them. Using Japan, the net effect of all their private companies selling into the US created a huge negative balance of trade account. For many years now, if these countries walked into the foreign exchange markets and sold these excess dollars for Yen, it would have drove the yen way up. If done early and before a large position builds up, this is the "natural way" a true fair currency exchange market should work. If the US continues to buy more from Japan than it sells, the currency markets react until the goods being traded are evenly priced.

This action would protect the workers of both countries from being exploited, even though their productive efforts are equal. Contrary to the "business community propaganda" a worker in Japan does not tighten a bolt better or faster than one in the US. Take all the technology innovations and
pour it into a big pot along with natural human nature and add some cultural differences. Boil it down and we find that through the world over everyone works the same for the same incentives. Of course the business community always leaves out a "true" incentive / compensation package when comparing national productive effectiveness. Trust me, I've been everywhere and seen it all. You would not work as "effectively" and as productively in, say India, if you received the same pay they do. No, by far and wide, the real national industry productivity measurements are all
skewered from "engineered" exchange rates between nations.

So, back to our currency rates. No person or nation ever extended it's wealth by selling two TVs in exchange for one TV. The US knows that the road to national wealth is not in a strong currency by itself, rather it's through operating in a manipulated currency market! If your workers can tighten one bolt in exchange for foreigners tightening two or three bolts, your wealth, standard of living and voting citizens are better off.

Under the old dollar / gold standard, no foreign government wanted to see it's people tightening 3 or 4 bolts in trade for every one the US worker did. Perhaps a ratio of one turn for two could work for a while until their economies grew. But no one wanted to get locked into doing this forever, as this modern dollar standard has forced then to do.

It worked better back then as they traded two turns of the nut for one US turn and they retained a little gold wealth in the form of US dollars. Are you still with me? This is important to grasp.

------- A foreign nation traded real wealth for real wealth, even though gold was part of the wealth equation. No, I'm sure it wasn't equal, but it was close. In return, the US gave up some sovereign power over it's gold hoard by allowing gold claims,,,,dollars,,,,to be held overseas. In return they still increased their living standard by getting more value than they sold, even though some of it was
in gold trade.---------

All of this started the "new era" of a negative US balance of trade deficit. No ORO, it didn't show up on the official money flows because the US did send the dollars out. BUT!!!,,, they didn't record the trade on the negative side as the """gold loan"""" it really was! Yes, we shipped some bullion out, but more often than not, nations were content to leave the gold in the US where it was to back the dollars held overseas. The proof that this occurred comes in the fact that by 1971, the dollars outnumbered the US gold five to one.

So, as we can see, nations starting holding dollars and US treasury debt because it represented a wealth for wealth exchange. Nations, Japan included, were content to have their Central banks enter the currency exchange markets and buy up the excess dollars their businesses created when
they sold more to the US than they brought. In that time they did not think they were exploiting their workers into making two turns on the bolt for one US turn, because they were trading most of the additional "twists" for the wealth of gold.

By 1971 the "dirty float" of currency exchange markets was normal practice until the US closed the gold backing for the dollar. Suddenly, all the dollars that were purchased overseas to adjunct the exchange rates were now worthless! The only recourse for governments to regain real wealth
for all the additional "nut turns" was to use the dollars to buy local American goods. One problem though, all the dollars were collected while the gold standard impacted exchange rates! Now, with only a pure dirty float for an exchange market, any reverse selling of the dollar into the US would drop that currencies value. So, the good purchased from the US would only represent a tiny return of the wealth value these dollars were originally traded for.

It is here that the story begins to change and the world heads for a new alignment. Everyone in the world was impacted by this move. From oil producers to auto makers in Japan. Everyone lost, big. If gold had become so worthless, as most US politicians proclaimed, why didn't they just
revalue what they had left to, say $2,000 and call in what dollars were out there? They didn't because in that scenario they would have drained the dollar as a reserve unit and killed the notion of dollar supremacy. Gold would have regained it's exact value as money to the world prior to
currency / exchange / standards. Perhaps $3,000 or $4,000 and ounce (back then) and the US would have run some real inflation.

The world Central Bankers (and oil producers) took a real hit when this all happened and it won't be allowed again. They have supported the fiat dollar standard and even helped "pump it up". All in an effort to keep business rolling until a new currency could be created. One based on
several economic national arenas, no dollar reserves and a world market price for gold. As opposed to the present IOU paper dollar gold system. Even though the Euro is born, this package is not complete, but it's getting there!

Truly, You have to have been around the turn a few times to understand that no one (and I mean NO one) is wanting a larger piece of the old dollar pie. The notion of currency parity for the purpose of trading up debt reserves is something being floated by the Washington think crew!

Are these nations trying to pay up for past US military action? Oh boy, not a chance. Why don't we pay Italy for all the good the Roman legions did for everyone!! No one is worried that the US will back away from protecting it's interest after it's bankrupt. Whether it's oil or national security, they will act as best as able. See ORO's post about this, it's real good. Besides, look at Russia. No
money, no nothing but still out there firing away!

Also: The present paper gold market depends on new hikers entering the gold trail towards it's end. They buy paper gold as some kind of stock market / investment hedge without knowing the big picture. In the past their actions would have worked their purpose. But, not in this transition. A
currency exchange storm is going to sink a lot of these paper boats and kill the very assets many wanted to protect. Buy the gold not the price!

oil and gold
My opinion is that there is far more oil money being spent on weapons than there is on gold. After all, what good is having a bunch of gold if you cannot defend yourself from someone taking it away from you.

Hello Hipplebeck,
Armies take more than just gold. Every physical thing is in contention. Perhaps they can't afford anything else, either? What about all the paper dollars or bank dollar accounts? With the threat of ending your life most will withdraw that too and offer it up! So, let's not keep any money.
Do you see where this line of reasoning is going?
Truly, people buy gold as an asset that stands right along with all their other things. Buying weapons never stopped anyone from buying assets.

FOA,

Thank you for your detailed reply. Would the manipulation not have been prior to August 1971, when the US printed dollars alegedly backed by gold, but which weren't backed by gold. Once the bluff was called in August 1971, what manipulation occurred after that date? The rest of the world
could have just "eaten" their loss, just as creditors always do when a debtor goes bankrupt, and accepted no more US dollars as settlement. That didn't happen. The question being: Why not?, and why should it be different now?----------------

Canamami,
The world did begin to walk from the dollar! It plunged and remained on a downtrend for several years! The US knew their option was to raise gold prices prior to 71 (just as I offered in the last post). But oil was the major problem link! Every oil person in the US knew we were running out of local reserves at the old "gold backed" dollar price. All the Middle East had to do was wait us out as they were happy to out produce and supply us in exchange for "real dollar
backed gold". You see, oil was and is the real driver of all economic production.

We could have raised the dollar price of gold to settle our accounts but that would not have raised the local oil price enough to make deep reserves available. Yes the dollar would have depreciated somewhat and foreign oil would have went up, but not enough. The need for more local reserves and the higher dollar prices that could make them available is what drove the 71 gold closure. They had us and we had them.

Without another functioning reserve currency system in place, our modern world would have shut down to a level of pure physical commodity trade. Perhaps worse than the 1929 era. With every other country about to stop trade for dollars, it was the Oil group that literally saved the
current system by backing our now fiat dollar with oil. This "black gold backing" took the form of accepting settlement of all world oil trade in dollars. And boy, did the world ever send them dollars! No body was going to walk from dollar trade as long as they had to buy their oil with it. It was that simple.

Don't think for a minute that people weren't running for gold then, either. Had the US, BIS and IMF not sold some gold into the demand the dollar exchange rate for bullion would have hit $3,000 or $4,000, easy! And that was back then, not now. Even then the gold rise was a controlled burn
to show people that they couldn't escape from all these dollars into gold. It would gun the price through the roof long before the exchange was complete. Why not just write the dollar holdings off, you ask? Hell most of the average trading partners didn't hold much gold! That was what holding the dollar was for. They would have completely wrecked their entire local economic / money system if they did walk.

As long as gold could remain in some form of ratio to oil )for conversion purposes), the dollar settlement was assured. At least until another reserve system could come along. It took the US 50 years to establish a reserve currency, so if it took the "Old World" ten years that was not long to hold gold at static dollar prices. Well, it took longer but so what? In the scope of things the transition to free market gold and Euros was the only choice. Hence the 20 year time lag that gold has gone nowhere. Yet, gold was being acquired through out this time. And it will be repriced in proportion to that time span.

A bunch of years ago, when the Euro looked to be late (very late), the drive to free up private gold holdings started. Yes, gold was being recycled by oil, just as the dollars were recycled. But, there was a physical limit to how much could be moved. For the last several years, it's been imperative to keep the price of gold down or it would kill the system. The US / IMF faction did all they could to help. But, understand this,,,,,,they never expected the Euro to work and fully well expected oil to run back into the dollar when it failed to be born! My god, when the Euro was
formed in the first few weeks, we almost had people talking about shredding documents and leaving town,,,,the game is over!

Do you remember the old Hunt brothers saying about an ounce of silver was worth a barrel of oil? Well I have news for you, it was rumoured long before that that a gram of gold was worth a barrel of oil. Forget the price of gold! Forget the price of oil! If a barrel of oil flows one way gold (or contract equivalent) must move the opposite until some ratio is reached. (oro understood this and posted it). They never flow in the same direction. When gold flow is disrupted, as in the mid and late 70s, oil prices rise! When gold is liquid, oil prices fall. From the beginning of this year, after the Euro was born, gold flow has slowed and oil is up. Another was telling me over and over that gold was being cut off then. Yet, we read gold expert after gold expert, telling us that the CBs were selling it all.

Next, the Washington Agreement was announced and these same people are on the wire telling everyone the CBs are lying,,,,, "They are still going to sell it all"! I can't wait till the ECB starts buying official gold from others using dollars! With this job off the BIS back sense the Euro was born, it's been in the ECBs court to support gold under $280. They didn't this summer (we took a lot of heat because they let it fall to $250), because they were putting together the Agreement for press, I guess. When the next official move starts, I suspect the gold experts will be saying,,,,,,,"they are only buying it to sell it" Ha Ha!! Oh well.

Truly, the Washington Agreement is "the" confirmation that the currency war is in progress. The LBMA has been left "hung out to dry" as they scramble to gather any and all gold political favours can muster. We can expect a flurry of paper gold, sold into every taker until something else breaks and then the rush up. After that, another truck load of paper. All the while the market credibility slowly wanes. Forcing physical gold trade and oil settlement into Europe. Without a functioning "dollar / paper gold marketplace, gold will gravitate to the oil price until "gram parity" is reached. I expect that long before we reach parity, physical gold trading will outprice the paper market. Confirmation of the "visible" gold bull market, that everyone needs so badly, will appear when London closes for good.

For all "Bullion Boys",,,,,,, Bullion Men,,,,,, for us old guys, (and ladies) (my wife included);;; we are on the road!
For all paper traders, good luck timing the motives, needs and thoughts of Political power brokers. (smile)
I have said enough for a while,,,,,,thanks for all your time and thought energy,,,,,,,,FOA

ALL:
The Dutch sale is right in line with the 2,000 limit in the Washington Agreement. In fact, it's very possible they may not reach that limit if the Swiss sale is constrained by their public. It's important to remember that in the past Dutch sales, the buyers were never known! This sale could be the return of the 79 tonne into Kuwait, replacing that deal and others that were forced by the LBMA?

Or, more likely we will see the books of the ECB slowly expand over the five year period as whatever amount of the 2,000 comes up for sale. Because we are under $280 now don't expect the ECB to be buying LBMA paper to bolster their paper credibility. Expect them to take in "real gold" on the official market. We will know over the next weeks and months, especially if the sale essentially becomes a "transfer" off the open market.

Now you know why being "on the road to high priced gold" will not be the fun easy ride to riches. These swings in the paper market prices are nothing compared to what is coming! Like I said in my last post; forget trying to time buying paper gold derivatives or gold stocks, you'll get killed in the political motives, feelings and forced plays! Buy physical for the eventual outcome. By the gold, not the price.

ORO, thanks for the post, I'll work on it later. If things don't get too out of hand!

TownCrier,
Thanks for all of your good coverage. Earlier today I noted that this Dutch gold sale could end up being no more than a " "transfer" off the open market". Your Msg ID:20414 is telling the world this same story. This is an exciting "block buster" item as it is the first "official" move by Euroland after the WA (Washington Agreement) that confirms their direction. By having the BIS move this gold they are avoiding giving LBMA and it's paper market any more credibility. In fact, one may see this as starving them. I think this gold will end up in the ECB or be held there for the account of Kuwait.
This falls back to the heart of my post (one of many) on the Sat.4th. The stronghold of the Dollar / IMF faction is being broken by establishing gold's value through "official channels". If they gravitate from using derivatives to establish price, the ECB / BIS will eventually create a two value market. The IMF revaluation of gold without selling it is the groundbreaking for this.
In the past (70s), we had an official price much lower than the so called free market price. Confirmation to the gold bugs that we are in a new era, will be when the ECB official price is higher that the "discounted" (read that failing) London fix! Of course we are not there yet, but, politically we have been moving in this direction from the first of the year.

I'm making a long post for ORO now, so will be back later.

Thanks TC, good work! FOA

FOA - All of this started the "new era" of a negative US balance of trade deficit. No ORO, it didn't show up on the official money flows because the US did send the dollars out. BUT!!!,,, they didn't record the trade on the negative side as the """gold loan"""" it really was!

I understand this. I understand that the gold obligations were not listed on the debit side of the US books. Specifically avoided was any entry of gold loans or anything containing references to it. Indeed the job of maintaining dollar - gold relationships has been a G7 and Oil country effort, and the bulk of it occurred in London with the participation of US creditors aiming to get something, for
the nothing (i.e. dollars) the US so happily issued them in payment. From the days of the London Gold Pool, to the spot markets of the 69-74 period, to the hybrid paper markets from then to 1980, and the mostly paper markets of the early 80s, and now the wholly paper markets ruling since.
To make one point about CB behaviour, the modern CB is accustomed to controlling the economy through the dictation of short term interest rates. A number of CBs work in concert to attempt getting the right balance. If a currency is to be weak, the interest rates are lowered, using the higher interest rate at the country, who's currency was to strengthen, to produce capital flows from the weakening to the strengthening one. Gold has been manoeuvred in this way as well. Low interest rates have caused a carry trade in gold without the CB doing significant lending. The CB offers
guarantees of liquidity - a promise to put its gold at risk, not directly putting the gold in harm's way. The issuance of calls, particularly currency settled ones in which the CB is not limited as to quantity, serves as a proxy for lending. But in this "foolproof" plan there is a snag, the abundance of currency settled gold calls issued can endanger the currency by creating a currency pump - a Buffet style
convertible bond with no floor for conversion - that can pump unlimited currency into the market in a death spiral. The Fed is repeatedly rumoured, now by more specific people, to have manipulated gold in "emergency situations" using either currency or gold settled gold calls.

FOA, do you know if the Fed is indeed issuing these calls, if so, do you have any idea of how much? Order of magnitude? ---------------------------

ORO, you are making nice orderly posts. They are slowly putting the whole act on stage for everyone to understand! Good stuff!

To your question: To the best of my knowledge, they are not! I'm 95% certain none of the independent (or dependent) fed branches are using their desk's to create (write) gold calls! ORO, the fact of the matter is that there are big people out there that would risk billions in loses, just to
grab a bunch of these and call for the contracts! They would do it, not as goldbugs, but just to expose an action such as this.
No, it's the BBs that carry the political load on this venue. They write whatever amount of contracts they want, mostly on the OTC. They can do it because just as the fed has the franchise to print money, the BBs can print gold. As long as the price is moved where needed, official CBs stayed
out of their marketplace. The private / public demand usage of derivatives (paper) gold could never move the price against them. It's that simple.
Actually, the risk has been building against the BBs for three or four years as the buildup to Euro launch was giving off warning signs. London, LBMA and IMF/US have owned the gold market from the get go. And they ramped up the drive for lower gold to benefit the dollar and dollar/oil settlement deals. Everyone, including Europe was pulling for the same outcome until someone saw the risk that the Euro was aligned with the Old World BIS. You see, only the BIS could destroy the present gold game because they represented the ability to price and move physical gold independently of london. Literally, off market (today's dutch deal??). It's in their charter.

Most of the time, they go with the flow, but today, they are aligned with the principals of the WA. Guess which oil producer is a big member of the BIS? When Big Trader (Chinese Central Bank) wants to be closer to the Euro, guess where the BIS opens an office? Get the picture? We are walking a different trail today.

Your other items:--------However, there are still these questions from my studies: How large is the Eurodollar market? (I have a current accounts based estimate of 21-24 $trillions in loans outstanding) -----------
ORO, it could be twice that big? This is another tanker of gasoline to throw on the fire. Most American gold bugs are waiting for some event to drive their people into gold. Yet, when it comes to moving physical gold, a run from the Eurodollar alone could take every thing offered at a huge
price. I absolutely know that modern gold analyst are lost as to how leveraged the world's physical gold is. It's mind boggling!

----------Does gold play any part in supporting the Eurodollar markets? I have seen the proportions of goods traded for dollars rise tremendously, as the productivity of the emerging market nations has risen but the number of dollars received for their production has not risen in proportion. The $ debt machine has been run by Europe and Japan to shift the cost of maintaining the US onto Emerging Market economies. Whereas the purchasing power of the dollar
in the Emerging Markets rose tremendously, the major foreign currencies - those of Europe and Japan, have enjoyed a 90% higher increase in their purchasing power vs. the Emerging Markets -relative to that of the dollar. This allows both Europe and Japan to increase their import volumes even more than the US, without even showing the slightest disadvantage in the balance of payments. I believe that this is the reason that Europe and Japan maintained the value of the dollar as long as they have. Now that the Emerging markets have buckled under this debt and are in the process of repayment, and the carry trades are breaking apart, there is no way to obtain any advantage out of it.

FOA, was this an intended occurrence, or was the crisis just one expected by the BIS? I seem to have found some indications that it was intentional.---------------

I think it was intended and driven in the direction that would eventually benefit the Euro. For one, China and most of Asia were taking so much gold that it threatened the pre Euro drive to hold gold down. The flow of physical became unstoppable. Stories that some large traders were calling
contracts and shipping through Hong Kong. Acting as pipeline for the China CB.
The dishording of private Western gold in lieu of derivatives was barely keeping a lid on this demand. All of a sudden, sweeping changes were made for collateral requirements through out the region. Business with the western world (and Europe) now required more reserves. It was hard to see this in the confusion of currency devaluation's and bank loses, but the overtones were present. It was if someone knew that one gentle nudge would kill two birds with one stone.
The IMF was known to be politically inadequate in dealing with the different cultural valuations of assets in this arena. Sure enough, they blew up everything they touched and turned what was a dollar debt power keg into a mushroom cloud. Today, the Euro salesmen are all over the place. Oh, and as a side note, gold demand was killed just long enough for the Euro to come onstream.

------However, The mechanism, like the Gold mechanism is a carry trade, an interest rate driven engine that forces itself to stall, i.e. Long $/short Yen trades have gotten so out of hand, that the slightest rise in Japanese interest rates would crash the system. A similar situation is close to being reached in the $/Euro trades.

FOA, was this the intent of the interest rate manoeuvres of the last few years on the part of both Japan and the EU?-----------

It was the BIS that rammed home the new capital requirements that they knew Japan's system could not live with. And Japan has been on a down fall ever sense. Any country that has 0% interest and a strong currency is a nation where assets are failing to pay their return. Cash becomes the most valuable item because local contract law requires Yen for settlement. Everyone looks at these people and comments on how rich they are. Yet, they are rich, not in Yen, but in non-functioning assets. The Yen is going even higher because of this and that will further kill their
economy. Kill the "rising sun" and you remove one of the largest supporters of the dollar!

True, Euroland is somewhat a closed system like Japan, but they have everything they need. Oil is their only weak link and I think you know what that story is. I don't know about the Euro carry trade yet. Too young of a market still.

ORO Something is in the works, got to go. More tomorrow. Thanks FOA


Finally, a rush of questions to you; how inclusive is the BIS group? Overtures were made to China,
Malaysia (included for a fact), and many other Asian nations. Is India included or being pursued?
South American countries are being wooed by both the US and the Euro faction. Do you see the
mangy US offer of major participation in seigniorage being preferred to the Euro side's "fair money"
offer? Are the BIS group members succeeding in recruiting South American participants?

PH, ORO, ALL:

A day hike off the main trail:

When I read the posts of Farfel, to me they represent the honest feelings of many gold bugs. Many of whom are caught up in a trading environment that is not playing out to match it's past format. But why did so many investors fully expect it to "play it again, sam"? It starts in the mind.

I think much of the frustration comes from accepting the "Western view" of gold values, in that "it can't rise in price that much"! Everywhere we turn conservative people consider the return of price inflation, oil shocks, economic slowdown and money security as evidence of needs to "hedge
their bets". Yet, of the many who use gold as this hedge, probably 99% hold the view that gold will only rise into the $500 to $600+ range, at best. This acceptance of such a mediocre performance is what drives the gold leverage game! Hell, if I thought that all of my assets were to be protected by something that only runs up 100% in an environment of wealth disorder, I wouldn't buy it either.

Again, through out all the endless discussion about gold's prospects, we always hear this same finite price position expressed. That being: " " "During an inflation of the dollar we can expect gold to move into it's safety value range of $600+/-. This price represents it's true commodity / money hedge demand fundamentals as detailed in industry research reports. Of course it could go into the $2,000 range but that would be the end of life on earth as we know it" " " There it is again. The whole hearted promotion of a limited rise. Anything higher and you are in the hard-core camp that sees world war.

This "play it again, sam" scenario is wholly supported by not only the "official anti gold" government groups, it's also pushed by the mining industry in general, to sell their stock product. I submit that this conditions investors to stay out of "gold bullion" and into leveraged forms of "paper gold". After all, if I can "time" my entry into futures, options or gold stocks, why hedge my wealth with something that can't move over %80 or so? In other words, "buy the price, not the gold" or expressed better "invest in the price move and you won't need gold". Indeed, all we are doing anyway, is trying to match dollar loses on our other wealth with dollar gains on these hedges.

Here, inside this mindset we can clearly see this magnificent evolution of "Western perception". Once a people that held great distrust of anything that wasn't real wealth, they now equate personal economic safety to anything that keeps their bookkeeping entries in balance. This is the modern feelings of life within the dollar world. Life on the inside looking out.

Further:

Ever have a neighbour that brought goods from someone in a truck, at night, on a side road? They purchased tools, TVs, stereos, anything that seemed good for them. Of course, when asked they noted that the guy selling the stuff seemed OK and he assured them he got it "wholesale" Later, this same neighbour shows up at the town hall meetings and goes on and on about all the stealing that's occurring in their fair city. (((I'm sure all of you get my drift)))

And here we have the investor that goes on and on about the unlawful writing of "paper gold" by the BBs and brokerage houses. He say's, "These guys are stealing from us by writing obviously "unbacked gold paper! They offer options, futures and all sorts of derivatives! It's got to stop!" Then, in broad daylight, in front of everyone, he runs to the truck in the alley and buys some of those "obviously illegal unbacked gold calls and futures". He even buy's into the mining companies that use these same "paper promoters". Turning a blind eye to the reality of his actions.

You see, in this context gold bugs support and nourish the very industry that is dragging them down. The modern marketplace that sets the price for gold, exists because "Western Investors" seek bookkeeping hedges, not physical wealth hedges. They not only support the false price
discovery of this gold marketplace, they are the reason it exists. Further, it exists because they believe real gold will not work for their purpose of hedging.

As distillers produced alcohol "against the law" to supply a demand during the American prohibition, so too do the "paper gold brokers" give the investing public what they want. It's that simple.

Onward:

It's true that the physical gold market is dwarfed by the paper gold market. Yet, the physical market is so thin in relation to total assets outstanding, even a small shift into it play's havoc with the supply and the price. Still, paper contracts, using fractional banking methods can be created to meet any demand. The key to changing the negative dynamic created from paper gold, is for investors to move from investing in all forms of paper gold and the mining industry that utilizes it the most. Encourage companies to challenge tradition and circumvent the bullion banking world by marketing their product directly into fabricators and end users. Instead of promoting their shares, educate investors as to the real valuations possible for gold using a true physical hedge marketplace. In addition, encourage investors to invest mostly in gold first, then gold stocks. Undertaken together, all of these moves would break the present "dollar lock" on gold employed by this same faction.

Unfortunately, the educated understanding of this current generation will not change without major loses incurred to their paper gold portfolios. With the ECB /BIS having all but guaranteed a "quick to the point" wholesale destruction of the dollar gold price making market. Investor
education and evolution will tread far behind the fact. Until that time comes we will continue to follow the play as bewildered "paper gold" followers bemoan these days because
"Sam, won't play it again"

Question to FOA and/or ANYONE ELSE
QUESTION TO FOA and/or ANYONE ELSE

----------------Hannibals have managed to press the POG down to nearly what it was before the announcement. By now, anyone in his right mind has to know the POG is manipulated. The natural price pressure would seem to be up. -----------

Bill, the problem begins because you (and most everyone else) associate the price pressures on the supply and demand of physical with price pressures on the supply and demand of (comex) futures. For discussion we will leave out all the other paper gold items.
Today, we look to the last contract traded to tell us what the price of gold is sold for. Even though the demand / supply for physical may indicate "up", the demand / supply of comex paper can be altered to force the last trade "down". Truly, if most of the players don't take delivery, and I have an unlimited fractional reserve bank account, I can print contract supply well over demand. As this natural demand / supply function works it's magic, the price falls until discouraged longs fall away.
So, the natural price we refer to must be clearly understood.

------The ability to force the POG down much further doesn't seem likely. -----------

It all depends on how much cash reserves I have to create long or short contract positions. I, as a market mover am in control as long as the other market for physical can be satisfied with metal at the paper gold settlement price. Too date, this is something the system has been able to do in spite of the supply deficit.

---------Any call options that were sold before Sep could be bought back now cheaper. If you were part of this manipulation. Would you not now liquidate your upside risk and reverse your position???? (now collecting profits on the way up). ------------------

Bill, the question here is our perception of risk. For the past many years, I (as the manipulator) have contained all risk thru price direction. I don't liquidate because the other side does not want gold, they only want to hedge against price. As long as I direct price through my paper supply, you hold the risk and must fold first. I don't reverse position because I hold this franchise as long as I
can direct prices in a "political direction". To date that has been down.

-------Unless the huge short positions have already been covered and from the constant manipulation, that doesn't seem likely. It would seem that a huge short covering rally could be gained as players don't want to be caught in the same position as Oct.------

Yes, the game has changed from the Washington Agreement. But, this short position constitutes the paper marketplace as we know it. As long as it remains, the gold market does "price discovery" through the paper auction method. Cover the position through offsetting cash (or gold) settlements
and the entire marketplace is destroyed from equety reserve loses to the members. Then we revert back to a physical only arena. In other words. No body is going to cover anything because it's like shooting yourself. Therefore, this system will have to be destroyed from a competing physical arena
that conflicts in price settlement. In other words, physical priced higher than futures. Get my drift?

Thanks FOA

REALIZATION-The Birth of the new physical Gold market.

Hello beesting,
I think you are getting your thoughts in order. This may not be the only story, but it will become the one that's most important to gold investors. There are a lot of players that are pulling in this direction and would like to see it begun before our economic cycle is brought to a close. We can all be a successful part of this "before the fact" if gold bugs buy gold and wait it out.
I hope to reference this more in future posts.

London Times: Thatcher Blasts Euro Army

Lady Thatcher says a standing EU armed force could threaten NATO and could create a Euro superstate. Isn't that "the road ahead"? FOA, better give LT a "heads up". She's OK by me.

Hello Cavan Man,
Yes, that is most likely the road they will go. I think the Lady will have a better "feeling" about this when (if for MK?) England becomes part of this "super state". Then she will be printing her opinion about the "rouge US military machine".
Contrary to most analysis, I think the US does more good in the world of "war stuff" than bad. But, we can never anticipate how a superpower will "evolve" as economic conditions tear apart a political infrastructure. For our present context, the US is on a timeline that's winding down as Euroland is ramping up. So, the US may evolve negatively as Europe evolves into the good guys. This is a hard thing to consider for anyone that is "true blue USA" from the get go (like me!). But, generations come and go and the world changes. We shall see.

ALL:

Returning from our side walk in #20527, I have a few more things to add.

As I offer it; anyone investing outside of physical gold, isn't in the gold market. They are simply playing derivatives of gold that create bookkeeping dollar value if the price is going in their favour. Whether gold stocks or Bullion Bank forward loan paper, Options or Futures, if your financial position in life isn't strong enough to convert these values into real bullion, the house deck is rigged against you because you cannot play a physical card.

Lost to ones paper position, you can never make the substantial value gains that will be inherent if a sole physical marketplace takes over. True, there are some major
political players that will have their contracts honoured at all costs, but "you are not them"!

This is the "reality" of today's modern gold market. A reality that is proven in the mind of the investor, not in the "bemoaning cries" of fallen "paper gold bugs".
Like in Another's Thoughts:
"In this world, truth, dreams and reality take on different meanings to different people depending on where
they stand on the mountain".

As time matures, we will witness louder denouncements of this gold market as it works it's will on the bookkeeping of these past and present "paper gold bugs". For them, they expect "their reality experience" to be as an example and the same for "bullion buyers". Yet, it's obvious how their loses do not equate or compare to bullion. They "extrapolate" that if one cannot invest in the "paper gold market" without it's manipulation, he should not invest in "any gold market". All for the proposition that "if paper manipulation" cannot benefit them, physical gold cannot benefit you. Further, if the price of gold in derivatives form is discounted into oblivion, there can be no physical market. Nor can the price of physical gold rise as their favourite investment medium falls.

I submit, that their reality and ours are different. We will hear the testimony of many more players as they offer proof that the "gold market" is "washed up". Many will read these and fully understand that it's "their market" that is "washing out", not the real gold market. So, trade the paper game for the "shot in the dark" today's marketplace demonstrates it is. But buy gold first and most for the future!

Onward, back to the main trail:

I know many stock market investors that understand what is happening with a keen feel for "true reality". Even though these people are not in any main stream majority, they are conservative and possess very, very long term track records.

As an example (he's not Another), one gentleman that is 80++, has had 2/3rds of his substantial wealth in the largest US Mutual Funds for over "" 25 years"" !!! And he has never sold!
He speaks to me with an impressive, clear perception of what is going on. Confident that 75% of the valuation of the US stock market is related to nothing more than dollar inflation. He feels that this phenomenon has happened in other countries during other times. The difference was that their money inflation's also created price inflation because their currency did not hold the World reserve status. (Used the old German inflation as one example). This usage of the stock market as an inflation hedge has served him well and did not influence his perception of economic "reality". Not
accepting the current argument that the markets represent a "new found era of US global economic strength", he still expects the equities to run further with this dollar inflation. Yet, believing that this trend will end with a tragic, sudden collapse, his success has not clouded his perception of what is real and what will show value "after the fall".

Three years ago, he began buying large amounts of gold on a monthly basis and does so into this day. Completely unconcerned that gold is not responding to our current dollar inflation,,,,,, "his reality" is:

---that long before dollar inflation creates a price inflation that drives stock investors into other "inflation hedge securities" such as Real Estate (REITs), Oil stocks or Metals Stocks,,,,,,, the pyramid that is our financial system will fail. Forcing a return to gold, not as a Central Bank reserve, but as a international currency. And this action is expected well within his lifetime!

He may be right or wrong, but here is one of many persons that understands what the "real gold market" is and why it is reacting to a different "reality" in the world today. And by the way, he knows nothing about "oil for gold" and doesn't care! Needless to say, I didn't go further.

Hope some of you found this interesting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,thanks FOA

FOA - Iron Lady and EU arms - Questions of the LBMA
---------------------------------
FOA, I believe that the EU countries will find it difficult to cooperate, which is always a plus when attempting to minimize war driven monetary inflation. But as a defence system, the independent EU military may be a positive in a way not possible before. Namely, to supply the world with a military force that only operates by wide consensus and is sensitive to issues of sovereignty, as opposed to the current US/UK system that tends to act in the interest of odd humanitarian concepts and for the furtherance of the misunderstood and misapplied concepts. The world is suffering today from the tyranny of the US humanitarian conscience. Being blurry in focus and misguided by self delusions of its own propagandists (particularly of Ted Turner and bride Fonda) they may well level a country that has done no one any harm. With the example of Yugoslavia behind us, I am certain that the whole of the sovereignty minded world will obtain the needed "weapons of mass destruction" to protect against the US delusions of sainthood. I would not be surprised to find Latin American buyers in Russian, Chinese, Paki, South African, and other
military shows - perhaps in Europe too - looking for the very weapons they are prohibited from obtaining by the non-proliferation treaties.

FOA, do you think that this is the trend before us? How do you view the outcome?
-----------------------------------------
ORO, It's late but here goes,
It's easy to be hard on the US as we watch the results of their "mostly good intentions". No one can control the outcome of major campaigns to correct human atrocities. The process takes on the form of "management in progress". It's either "let them all kill each other and everyone close to the fire" or try to "manage a better outcome". At the very least, a "situation" degenerates into just as bad an affair as if we never entered it. But, still it's more controlled! I know, hard cold thoughts indeed, until we "walk a mile in their shoes". Truly, anyone that tries to, at best "control" the blatant effects of human hostilities assumes the position of being blamed for the whole mess. It takes broad
shoulders to carry that load and the US still stagers under the weight. It's a tough job handled by tough minded individuals who's harshness few could accept.

Will Euroland do a better job? I doubt it. Looking through world history we find these times offer a disrespect for order that's on a different scale from before. The present process we are seeing is about "as good as it gets". So, what do we do, take the next plane from mother earth?
No, we all learn to manage our affairs in the context of the world political evolution.

I don't expect Europe to dominate in this regards. Like Japan, they are constricted by their history and will tend to underweight the need to react. Just as I pointed out before, national power blocks tend to work well in the worlds eyes during the initial build-up phase of their rise in economic status. In this regards, Euroland has the best of everything before them for the rest of most persons investment timelines. Conversely, it's time to leave the dollar based assets before they are discounted from the political degeneration that must follow.
-----------------------------
You write:
You indicate that the UK has understood that its economic future is with the EU and the BIS organization, and has been dragged kicking and screaming (however muffled these screams may be) into the fold. The Iron Lady seems to have been left out of the loop, and I would venture a guess as to the Torries' being in the dark as well, all but the few in key leadership ("king making") positions.

FOA, how much of a done deal is the inclusion of the UK into the EU? The LBMA, would it be "saved" if it were willing, under the BOE leadership, to play along with the EU plan?
-----------------------------

ORO,
Trust me (smile), she is in the loop. It is a weak political figure, indeed, that allows their people to see them quietly go along in a major change. In full public view one must "show the sword" first, then "over time" we hear: " " "Well, because they put it that way it sounds more practical. Had I fully understood the positive side of this earlier we could have found positive ground. You should
have been more open with me in the past so we all could have come together sooner." " " Get my drift?

The UK is no different that many other countries that have completely tied themselves into the dollar. Just like Canada, they are drained from the process and have much less to offer. The EMU for the UK is a done deal, if for no other reason that they will sink until they join. The big plus for
them is their past and present ties to Europe makes it all feel confortable, like an old chair you have used before. The only question is raised in the minds of the people. It's really a perception problem because they still think they have some major national economy an a sovereignty to go with it. In reality, the UK will have more political force and a more powerful economic platform within the EMU. Just as our California is a "state of mind", so is the present UK.

The LBMA is going nowhere. It's quickly becoming a distinct eyesore on the world bullion trade. Now that the dam has been broken to revalueing gold off the current market, their political use by the IMF/dollar faction is waning. Every day that goes by, the need to keep gold down is disappearing. In fact, any transition from the the current IMF / SDR articles will negate it's use in present format. They even changed the name. As the world works it's way away from dollar reserves (China?) and dollar commerce, the need for liquidity to cover the old IOUs (IMF and
others) will be all consuming. It's all really very simple if viewed in the right context. If denominated in the true price of gold reserves, the dollar had bankrupted itself long ago. It's only more bankrupted now as it's only a bookkeeping problem. In other words, where do we allow gold to level out in dollar terms $3,000, $8,000, $10,000 etc.? Understand, that new equity is not being created here, only marking current world dollar holdings to market. As the dollar comes off the reserve standard, they have no use at present exchange rates and will flood the US until "foreign
exchange controls are in place". The resulting US inflation will make those foreign gold reserve prices look "about right".

Note: ORO, it's the political exchange controls that will block your contention that the US will become a major "low priced" exporter. Your process would be good and a natural one except it would result in the "pooring of America" (at least politically). The US became wealthier by importing things and paying for them with an exchange rate that is "out of whack". A crushed currency enslaves a nation to work hard for less in return. History shows that every national block resists this "downfall" through money flow controls. It doesn't work, but it's the political choice.

So, Where is the LBMA in all of this? Over their heads and far too committed with supporting this present pricing system for gold. It's a system who's time has come and gone. Of course they will fight to preserve it, because without it the reverse leverage of a rising paper gold price will take
everything they have. Does anyone in their right mind think they will just stand up and say; "OK, we cannot supply physical to cover all this gold debt, so we will just fold!"? No, As time goes by the physical gold market will rise as it discounts their paper. It's a real process because you will always have gamblers that hate to lose the this "old leverage play". They will buy future gold right down to $10 to the ounce on the idea that something may save the program and perhaps, just perhaps somebody will supply $50 in gold against the paper. You, know the old junk bonds bet.

As the physical price rises well past the paper price, every miner and user in the world will be trying to get out of their commitments. Even Barrick now admits (finally) that above $600 they have to start supplying margin. After all this time of telling everyone that they could defer their contracts for 10 or 15 years. This goes back to my post about "Westerners" not thinking that gold will rise.
Because investors thought it was impossible for it to go above $600, to consider that long term goldlenders would not ask for margin al was nuts. If gold hit $5,000 does a lender just depend on ABX's good word?? It shows the beautiful evolution of "Western investment thought".

Again, LBMA will not be in a position to advise anyone as this plays out. Truly, this relic of London's past will be put on a shelf.

------------------------
Another question: The level of awareness of the bullion banks as to their vulnerability to a "bank run" is obviously high, the question is whether they are aware of the closeness of the end of the line.
(1) Do they understand that the EU is no longer aligned with the US in protecting the dollar?
(2) Are they aware of the gold revaluation concept for backing the Euro?
(3) Do they understand the situation which they are in regarding the consequences of the Arab Oil being pulled away from its role of supporting the dollar?
(4) Are they aware that the Oil Royal's gold will be both pulled out from further cycling through the lending schemes and revalued by the direct trade of oil for gold without 100% transit through the dollar?
-------------------------

ORO, Even a person "blind in one eye" can see a mountain. Of course they see the risk! But, if you are the last man on the front and the war is lost, you will fire your last round. Don't forget, there are a lot of major miners and fabricators that could not operate without them. They would literally go down with the ship if this doesn't change. The whole industry is built into this present gold pricing
structure. Yes, the gold in the ground stays, but their whole equity structure is obliterated with this shift. The forcing of the paper price, the price they all sell to, will clean out their bookkeeping because they cannot sell into the price of officially revalued CB gold reserves. Yet, that will become the new physical price structure. Sure, they will mine again, just not on your present equity. And the
good mines that are trying to wiggle free will face enormous structural tax and national royalty changes.

--------------
Finally, do the bankers that run the bullion banking business understand that the days of the dollar are numbered? That the dollar has no intrinsic value, and that it can't obtain value from being a medium of exchange? That the quality of the cash dollar is undergoing a substantial and fundamental change from that of being, in effect, an oil receipt backed by gold exchange (at a controlled exchange rate approximating redeem ability) in the LBMA, to that of being nothing in particular at all
finally trading as fully floating currency as it had before 1980?---------------

Again, of course they do! We must grasp human nature, we manage our business and then we manage our "personal affairs". Two different perceptions, right? You run your business in the current political climate as you invest
your wealth for the future political climate. We have to see the fact that the gold markets have been used for the past 20+ years in preparation for the next 20+ years. Their real transition only began a few years ago. The road to $30,??? / gold begins with the dismantling of the past dollar / gold
exchange rate mechanism and everyone that trades it. For these last few years you can't see it in the price because it's in the flow. What you see and feel right now is what being on the road is all about. A period of transition.

It arrives in the cries of investors clinging to what they thought was gold, only to find it wasn't. Owning physical during this transition may not show a wealth increase until the old paper markets really start to dissolve (or then again it may?). The people who think they are going to just ride paper and transition over after they realize their leveraged profits, don't have a clue. When the
discounting begins (for real), the paper markets will close and bullion will disappear. Even the physical dealers will stop for a while. You can guess where trading will start again, in the $?,??? range.

---------------
Is the gold redeem ability point lost on the LBMA members as it was lost on most actors in the financial markets? Is the "de facto" dollar redeem ability (into paper gold) - through exchange at the LBMA - a true representation of the system till the advent of the Euro?
---------------

I'll work on this later,,,,,,thanks ORO, hope all this makes the click go off.

Hello again Michael,
That was some good post. I received a lesson on Mountain Economics and learned of the driving force in Mid America. I agree with you in that Euroland will grow as a defence machine is produced. It seems that self defence is an ages old component of daily life and commerce. Yet, the
process of building it is always more employable than using the products for their intended purpose.
Yes, Margaret Thatcher understands the outcome and is positioning her thoughts for the entertaining discussion that will come. We will have to watch this closely because it isn't often one gets to watch a nation "talk themselves into doing something" that helps all their citizens.
We also have to correlate into the equation that; if building a defence in Europe is economically good, then dismantling NATO will further slow this part of US GDP. If it's good for the goose, it's bad for the duck!
England knows that if they go with Europe, their political reason for defending the dollar will be gone. No reason to hold dollar reserves; no reason to support a paper gold marketplace; indeed, no reason to trade with the US. Except to sell us their beef (smile). Yes, as the UK slides into the Euro fold, others will take note and follow. America will be forced to withdraw inside itself and
increasingly share the world with the world. None of this would be so bad if only the dollar was not so dependent upon others "holding it for reserves" as opposed to "using it to buy US goods.

As Time Runs Out

FOA:
Today Bill Murphy writes: "Some in our gold crowd talk of settlements of physical gold. The Frank Veneroso's of the world believe the big guys are SO SHORT gold they cannot get out. That is the reason for this continued manipulation. The gold loans are over 10,000 tonnes now. The shorts are trapped. Thus the gold loans are not loans because they cannot give back the asset. Ted Butler (I Accuse) is right. The loans are a fraud. THERE CAN BE NO SETTLEMENT - what BANK makes loans on something that cannot be paid back?"

If I read your thoughts correctly, the evolution of this situation has been as the intentional laying of groundwork in preparation for the new reserve currency status of the Euro as it takes over from the dollar. If the bove -mentioned 10,000+ tonnes is truly "unrepayable" and the ultimate solution (after the collapse of the current dollar-based settlement system) is intended to be the establishment of a Euro-based gold trading mechanism with final settlement being allowed in Euros to establish it as a
viable reserve currency, would it not be fair to say that the new trading/market system in Euros must be openly established soon to provide for a (quasi-?)orderly transition as this all unravels? With the public accusations now being launched at Congress by GATA, isn't time running out even faster for the Euro organizers? It seems unlikely that they would have anticipated such a developement to be coming from within the United States in this way.

What a story!

-----------------

Good Day PH! I'll build on your observations.

It has been quite a process and is becoming more open as time goes by. Even now, regular gold bugs that are high profile traders are coming around to the implications of all of this. The public is learning about all of this well before the fact. Something Another wanted to happen. GATA is doing a great service without the legal actions. If they wanted some real support they should jump on to the direction this is going and advocate a new physical marketplace. Having opened some Western investor eyes, this direction would impact the thinking of the mining industry. Before it's too late.

Still, a large segment of the Western mindset has been trained that gold should be in the $500/$600 range because fabrication demand says so. They give no thought what - so - ever about what gold would be trading at if it were supplying the demand of a pure physical market. A market that must satisfy the void created when the dealers that trade 30 million ounces of paper gold a day, have lost so much equity that they cannot quote a paper price any longer. Add to that the further demand equation of world investors "holding real gold" as a "background currency"! An action that will mimic the ESCBs in their new style of using gold as one of two currencies to settle real accounts. The IMF has already begun new action of accepting gold as a real account payment and now the Dutch follow this trend.

Under these circumstances, most modern investors cannot see the leverage that holding just one ounce of pure gold implies. Yes, everyone accepts the point that a huge domestic dollar inflation would justify a super gold price. But reject the fact that a coming currency crisis could trigger this as a sudden event. They wait for a "typical" price inflation, like in the 70s, to point the way, but it
never comes. However, present the facts that the dollar has already been inflated more than enough to bring such a high gold price prior to big price inflation and they do not believe it.

On top of this already in place dollar inflation, the Washington talk is all about the Fed's current "largest expansion of dollar liquidity" ""ever""! Within this environment, create a situation that cuts off all foreign dollar holders from domestic US gold and watch the fireworks. They must chase the Euro physical markets with dollars that can't go home and are no longer needed for savings reserves.

To build further: Again, the present circumstances do not require a real high domestic inflation rate to drive gold to extremes. Once the dollar begins it's retreat from being used as official "reserve holdings" overseas, the US treasury must shield the local economy from this coming price inflation by erecting a whole wall of controls. In other words, "if you don't want to play with our currency,
we'll show you"! Import limits on goods and currency, duel exchange rates for dollars, etc., all put in place before the fact of a major price inflation. We are talking about 5% inflation on the way to 30%+. The realm of super gold before the super inflation can justify it.

Yes, this will create shortages ( and the usual big mess), but it will also hold the goods price line to just a panic level (using the same precedent of cooking the current CPI books?). During these times, the price of foreign "official gold" will be traded on and off the books at sky high levels. The LBMA will be in a crisis and physical gold will be in the many thousands. Local gold will move at even higher levels. Again, all taking place with only 5% to 12% inflation. This is a text book example of a process that has always followed when a currency is devalued, internationally. Only, this time it's a reserve currency not just being removed from settlement use, it's being replaced as a reserve holding.

MK noted that the ECB needs to get the Euro "in use" for it to gain acceptance. Yet, the stage is being set for a virtual "run" from international dollar trade settlement. OIL, GOLD, minerals, food, you name it, it's just as ORO is following; "refinance all debt and trade into EURO accounts while the dollar is strong and liquid". Once the tide turns, the need to pay off trade financing in this different currency creates a spectacular demand, even if one does no business with Euroland.

Why do it? If one owes dollar debt that's subject to nation to nation trade outside the US, it's better to transition into Euro payments because "eurodollar" (dollars outside the US) price inflation will play havoc with your business. Opposite, if one holds dollar notes the resulting dumping of unneeded CB dollars from the ECB, China, etc. will also kill your return. In other words, no one wants to trade in a currency that is about to see it's float mushroom from a fixed holding into a liquid holding on world markets.

What of all the gold contracts being settled in Euros? You bet! And the DRAW here, is that the ECB marks it's gold market to market with the process, later, extending to using "official" gold deals as the market price, not the paper LBMA. When push comes to shove, they will settle
Euroland gold notes at the official gold price, "in EUROS"! They can do this because their currency holds exchange reserves in gold that adds value as gold rises. The extra Euros printed to supply this demand will only fill the dollar void and be represented with gold reserves. When the dollar "paper" price starts it's "final" dive into the pits by discounting it's present credibility, it will drag every
contract holder with it. This risk is real and will fuel the drive that demands a new Euroland physical marketplace.

Until such a market is created, miners will continue to settle their production at the dollar / IMF market price. They have to because the Bullion Banks of the LBMA and their affiliates, handle almost all mine finances. To this day they direct most miners marketing practices in the interest of "collateral security". Besides, no one is going to be selling gold into the private BIS system until they are ready to accept it. Even as the "Official" prices begin to gravitate above the paper price. Most likely a local US dealer physical market will appear that also sells "hard to find" "on the spot" physical at the higher than paper price. All of this fuelling the rush into physical and away from the risk of paper. Even mine paper.

Hope this adds a little to your perception and shows what we should watch for in the news.

Thanks PH and everyone, I enjoy this quiet time to understand your thoughts as you understand

FOA: Re Physical vs Paper Gold

1) To my mind, the two prices can only explicitly diverge (setting aside forward pricing considerations of course) when some of the writers of paper contracts actually default on calls to deliver and that fact is recognized by the broader market. I add the latter qualification because both
Ashanti and more particularly Cambior in effect did default but the fallout was absorbed by the financial institutions most closely involved and so a public default was at least postponed.

---------------------

Hello Joey,
Ashanti and Cambior did not fail to deliver gold, they failed to deliver margin. A big difference. Prices for contractual instruments can diverge greatly from the items they represent. Even when a bond is defaulted on (it fails to pay interest or return the principal) it continues to trade at a discount to the physical (currency in this case) it represents. I submit, that when a gold loan is actually
defaulted on, it can and is often sold into the secondary market at a discount. There is always a "gambler" ready to buy anything discounted in the hope it will pay off.

Comex gold is discounted in price, everyday as players speculate weather gold "could be delivered" at the "current physical price" settled at days end. To date, these futures have mostly shown a "premium discount" because no one has defaulted "in size". Some see the "premium" of future months as somewhat of a "contango" that represents the current interest and lending rates. Yet, in reality, the pure recognition of this is that it is a "premium discount" that compares to present returns on other instruments.

Most likely, Comex would not allow the discount to go "negative" from a lack of physical delivery because the leverage is so great against their members. A cash settlement on close would lock all contracts into accepting whatever discount to physical existed at that time. In a true disorder, it could be in the hundreds, or more!

----------------------

2) Once a public default does occur, then to my mind one of two things would happen. Either, as you say, the markets would in effect shut down for a period, probably with official "encouragement" (ref pt. 4 below) and when trading resumed, gold's nominal price would be a great deal higher.
Meantime, presumably, black-market trading around the world would have worked its price discovery magic.

----------------------

Joey, I a true international default, "price discovery magic" is usually created from extremely thin volumes. In paper markets, high prices bring supply. In commodities markets, high prices cause dishording. In a currency crisis of biblical proportions, gold is held "at all costs" for things dear. History shows this as fact.
Yes, trading will resume in gold. But it will be for physical only for some time.

---------------------

3) Alternately, if the initial defaults were peripheral as opposed to occurring at the clearing level of COMEX or the LBMA, the markets might continue to function while attempting to discount the risk of further defaults. Paper contracts would then trade at some discount to the physical gold price, the degree of which would be determined by the quality of the individual issuer. Given the extravagant degree to which this de facto fractional reserve system has extended credit and fiduciary media, I rather suspect any such interim period of paper discounting would be brief and
ultimately unsustainable.

-----------------------

Sir, the present leverage inherent in our gold market will render any peripheral default as lethal. Even though many fractional reserve dollars will be made available to settle claims, even these dollars will be discounted against physical gold. The markets know better than you and I that "par" is an even trade when perception is lost.

------------------------

4) When the gold liquidity crisis finally does occur -- and I confess to being surprised at the continuing survival of the current farce -- my best guess is that the mechanics for dealing with it will be that most paper contracts (such as those on COMEX and the LBMA) will end up being mandatory settled (in cash) at a price or range of prices determined after much intrigue and high drama. If you like, a sort of industry wide and officially managed force majeur.

----------------------------

I agree! Many gold traders will be depositing "force majeur" into their bank accounts. These loses will drive the run into physical all that much more.

-------------------------------

5) From that point on, any future paper contracts -- or any which have survived the carnage -- will be accepted only very warily and writers will have to regularly establish that the backing is in place. In this, I would have thought it won't be all that different to the aftermath of bank runs back in the good old days before central banks, deposit insurance and lenders of last resort. As one example, high quality, well financed miners might well choose to sell gold bonds direct to investors rather than going through the extraordinary sham of recent years.

---------------------------------

After the fact, we shall discuss #5 again and compare our observations.

---------------------------------

Well, FOA, it certainly seems the few comments I'd intended to make have grown somewhat. Always seems to happen when I start trying to explore a good, juicy topic! I hope you find it so as well and greatly look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Beesting,
I just wrote a full post to you and my system lost it?? Oh well.

Your question of time? I expect it will begin as the present markets start to fail. Trading will be driven to another arena. Prior to the Euro, the BIS would have been seen in the physical markets creating a premium over paper. Yet, I now think that the decision was given to the ECB and they
concluded that it was politically better to allow the IMF/Dollar gold faction to self-destruct. In retrospect it was a good choice rather than be seen as the aggressor. The same holds true with the establishment of a Euro market for gold. This question was put to them in public and they denied it. Again, a smart play.

From the role of LBMA as the main conduit for gold exchange and the core of physical gold distribution, where both buyers and sellers meet incognito, there would obviously be a problem for producers to sell their gold without a location for meeting their buyers. The need to start with cash for gold trades of producers and buyers on a bilateral trade basis would obviously cause many of the gold producers problems, since they do not fabricate and have no direct connection to the retail markets.
--------------------------
ORO,
Marketing concepts evolve in funny ways. Miners assume all the process of finding, mining, milling and then shipping dore bars. Who said it should start or stop there? The term mining could have only included the actual digging, leaving out all the rest.
Following this same line, why could they not have included fabricating the gold into industry standard certified bars? I know, the gold used to be shipped to the government and stamped into money bars and coins. But, after the governments "publicly" got out of the "gold is money" business, the miners left themselves open by substituting the BBs as the government arm for the process. Today, they should include the cost of fabricating the gold to industry standard and selling it directly to the end users, be they are investors or manufacturers. Let's face it, it would have been better for them to cut deals with the actual buyers of the product than let a middle man control them for the
privilege. For every ounce of gold borrowed and sold to create a forward deal, the mines could have just sold their own production with an interest rate premium. You know, the reverse of the forward deal.
Currently, in a straight deal, the gold is borrowed at a few percent and sold. The money earns interest and some of that interest becomes the premium that the mine brags about as selling over spot. In reality they are just earning low interest on their unmined ore. Yet no one talks about the
interest the person loses that purchased the borrowed gold. That's right! The money man buys gold and receives nothing on it. So why can't he cut a deal with the mine to buy it's gold over the time of production and pay him an interest premium over a fixed spot to do it. Then the buyer does the
same thing the mines now do. That is earn interest on the unused money until the gold is mined and sold. He splits part of it with the mine.
Honestly, it was the greed of the mine owners that stopped this. They said "we mine gold for our stockholders and will never lock in the price for such a small return". Then they turn around and entangle themselves in the same deal, except it's sold to them as a hedge for a falling market.
You see, they left the physical arena and jumped into a political game with wolves. And never knew they were being eaten up!

--------------------------

The emergence of the BIS as the trading organization for cash based trading once the LBMA (mutant ninja derivative of the old London gold pool) is closed, should provide a market for the producers and buyers to meet. The transition would not be smooth, however, if the producers are allowed in by the BIS, or their CBs are allowed to participate, the producers should fare well till their home countries start laying significant royalty and export duties, and should still do well afterwards.

---------------

Well, I think a physical market will arrive using the new BIS official price averages. Then it will transition into some ECB sanctioned Euro Physical market. Perhaps conducted by the Swiss as Beesting suggests. Still it's going to be a rough process for mined gold to travel.

---------

Why should there not be a way for them to trade? Would the (unhedged) producers be excluded purposely by the new BIS based market? Would the (surviving) producers be allowed to trade with the fabrication buyers? With the retail customer? PDG's old coins come to mind as one way of doing this.

--------------

All good questions we will have to follow as this evolves.

Joey,
OK, I see how you perceived my reply. Let ne go further with you and then I'll present a different light to everyone in the next post.

Your words:
-----------------
1) You're quite right, I should not have suggested that Ashanti had in effect defaulted. Cambior, however, is as far as I can judge in a slightly different class in that they had sold considerably more calls maturing in 1999 than warranted by their production capacity. In this sense at least, they only avoided default by an effective "restructuring" of their committments.

----------------------

Again, I point out that both of these companies did not default. They failed to place more margin (cash money) behind their hedge positions. It made no difference to their broker Bullion Banks that gold was not delivered. As long as they covered their risk with more cash, the position could stand or be extended without physical. The outcome, as we all know was that they had no extra cash!
Recently, in London a big deal was made over the fact that many players in the paper gold arena were not being required to carry appropriate collateral against their short gold position. Whether they were miners, hedge funds, commercials or whatever, they shorted gold in the form of paper and bullion and this was being treated differently from all other asset trades. I submit that this practice has evolved from the past political position of supporting a lowering gold price with official gold sales, lending and most importantly "guarantees". Now that the Euro group has walked away from this position (at the absolute correct time for them), all the players in this field are left holding
positions that suddenly require much more margin, even with gold at these levels. No one is playing the gold lending game today except from being pressured from the possibility of severe risk if they don't. They now perceive this real risk in that physical gold could be withdrawn from supporting the paper marketplace by moving to physical trade only and doing so first on the official BIS levels.
Under these circumstances, commodity gold could become "super gold" and the reverse cash margin leverage against shorts of all kinds could be just enormous. The $600 "drop dead" level for Barrick could seem like the good old days of no margin exposure at all.

Now, with that in mind:

--------------------------

2) In response to my point (1), you suggest that defaulted paper could trade at varying discounts to physical. As is I think apparent from my earlier post, I agree with this but believe that given the degree of leverage extant, any such interlude would be brief and the markets would soon "lock up". In your comments on my point (3), however, you seem to imply that any peripheral default would be lethal. No doubt I misunderstand your intent but these two reponses do appear to be in some slight conflict.

--------------

Joey,
The discounts will first appear small for some time as players assess the situation and begin to conclude that default is possible. First notice day on comex will find some players actually getting bullion at a discount, but most will begrudge the cash close as not representing a fair market. They are the ones that always roll over or close out without delivery. Not that default has happened or will soon, but that it is a possible risk that will create the first uncertainty. We are "on the road " in this direction as I write. It is becoming apparent that some OTC paper gold may be at risk of forced settlement in some kind of "physical discounted price" of dollars if any "peripheral default" does show it's face. Again, I submit that the discounting of all paper will begin small prior to the real
default and this action will slowly kill the modern paper gold markets. Until! Like this:

Some 95% of the Western traders in paper gold today, do not take delivery. They are in this game only to receive the cash price gain (or loss) as a means of gaining the increases value of gold. For them, the integrity of the market is not in it's delivery ability, rather in it's ability to mark their long contracts to the market price of physical. In their perception, their only risk (outside of price movement) is that these contracts are not settled at a cash price, close to buying spot physical. This is the little known "weak spot" in this system.

If delivery of physical does become somewhat of a problem on the massive OTC world arena, it would show itself first, not in an increased price of futures over physical but in a discount of futures to spot physical. Yes, the futures would rise in price as some shorts cover and the contracts try to keep up with physical. But remember, in a real physical shortage, the world BBs that make this paper market will be selling paper to the very limit of their ability to keep the paper prices from going against them. For them, the physical price is secondary as it's the paper market that creates price discovery and controls the settlement margins. Our recent run was not how the end will
appear. When the real play begins, physical (not futures or paper) will soar ($100, $200 or $300+++) the first day! The futures will try to run and then fall far away. Some in the media will no doubt say that the physical bars are trading at a strange premium to the real price of gold. It will
come across that the paper price is not in discount, rather it's at par as the coins show this huge premium. I know that's nuts, but we will hear it.
This dynamic will manifest itself in the form of futures being bid to discount not only from the BBs but from the commercial traders not wanting to risk a "par" trade for what may be cash, not gold. In the end, because the spot month creates the settlement price, trading could be forced into immediate cash settlement on close before delivery and not marked to the higher physical market. Or, all futures could see a "cash liquidation" decree as trading locks. Indeed, a close that will find physical trading much higher than that cash close. Large players will understand this well before the fact and dive head first into whatever physical can be had, further gunning it's price.
This is the realm of "super gold". It's what being on the road will feel like. However, the ending of our present paper gold markets will not end the coming rise in gold. No, that rise will have only just begun.

" " "Econ 675, Advanced Graduate Level Money and International Banking: Market Disequilibrium Scenarios, otherwise known as USAGold Forum" " "

-------------

Hello Mr. G,
Ha! Ha! That is some class you are taking. One of the things Another wanted to accomplish is happening. That being, getting Western citizens to reconsider exactly what gold was in the eyes of other real people. In order for that to happen, people had to understand the evolving modern
politics of gold and how it has created a "New Gold Market". One far different from the one goldgugs of the 70s had grown to know and love.

In the beginning, many readers had no basis for comparison when reading most of Another's Thoughts. Yet, we walk this evolutionary trail of gold today with eyes wide open and better able to grasp the impossible road ahead.

Onward:

I have seen one sure sigh that Westerners don't really know what has happened to their wealth. This is demonstrated when one "bemoans the loss of good times" if gold goes very high. It comes across the same every time; " " "if gold goes to $30,000 we won't have a dime and everything will fall apart" " ". Well, Another made his point that the dollar said your wealth was worth more than it really was. Let me demonstrate.

Like this:

Ever been to a high priced auction. They bring out the "Strad" violin and start bidding at $500,000. After a while it goes for $1 million flat and it's over. After that we listen to the perceptions around the room.

One guy in the back, who has 10 million cash, thinks the Strad was cheap at one mill and will pick one up next year. In fact he may get ten if they are offered. Some rich woman has 3 million and she figures her wealth is equal to three "violins" if she ever wanted them.

All around the room the feelings are the same as perhaps 100 million in assets are represented. They all equate their buying power to this one auction. Even though only one walked away with physical, everyone knows they are "strad rich" in wealth. Each goes home for the evening cognac
and relishes in this knowledge. Their lifelong effort of hard work and shrewd investing has positioned them to own the wealth of many rare violins. Life is good, very good.

The one problem with all of this is that they based their "wealth holdings" on the outcome of just one auction. Truly, had they all bid, the violin would have gone for much more and their wealth would seem "not so much".

In much the same way our world of dollar assets carries the same risk. All of us stand in the same world auction room and watch the daily bidding for goods and services. We watch the prices of cars, gas, houses, clothes, etc. and conclude our wealth balances based on what we could
acquire at this auction should we choose to bid. We see our economy in a light of infinite goods and services but fail to balance this with the potential of others to bid, "in mass". In this light, few have a valid perception of just how many dollar assets are out there. Indeed, without this grasp of "dollar inflation" we blindly consider out wealth and position in life using the present price structure of
"things". A system in which we trade paper IOUs of infinite number for real things of finite number.

So, our belief that life is good, largely rest not on the confidence in the dollar. Nor is it in the confidence that others will value and accept our dollars. Life is good, because all of us do not "bid" at the same time! If we did, our life would not be as good as our dollar wealth says it is!

This is the deception in our Western grasp of what wealth is. Our life savings are valued at what they can buy today, even though, in reality it is based on an unknown purchase price in the future. Just as all of the wealth at the violin auction was a phantom in self delusion, so too is our present good life and bank account numbers. The evolution of a people that once griped gold for the real
wealth money it was, has proceeded to the hoarding of bookkeeping entries of account credits. History has proven that once humans begin to question the value of this dollar "wealth owed them at a future unknown price" they run a race to outspend their loved brothers. Buying goods now at the "known" price quickly balances the books so no one is any longer fooled. The currency equivalents remain as a trading medium, even as real things are held in the background for value proof.

No, a high price of gold will not rob us of our wealth. It will rob us of this perception of money value that was but an illusion in the clouds. Wealth for tomorrow is found in this context for today; one cannot lose something they never owned. Buying physical gold at today's prices ($200 to
$500) will not help you maintain this modern illusion of wealth we never had. But will allow us to later spend the true value of gold that presently exists today. A value few will accept or believe.

Thank you all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FOA

Hello GFD, you write: ---------- The irony here is that most would not even consider going to the strad auction - they feel that they have to keep their money working so that it will be there for them in their 90's. --------------

Yes, I know. But the whole world of money is not wrapped up in Western Thought as is evidenced by asking the question; "who has been buying all the gold?" Out there, somewhere, people are buying a value that is not expressed today but will be spent tomorrow. Indeed, buying one ounce of physical gold today is like buying a highly leveraged investment for retirement. That is, leveraged to the extent that the dollar has been printed.

We can do nothing to change the mindset of everyone, yet a few will understand now. Later, if a person has even "one good eye" and is shown where to look, the progression of events will mark the trail. Of course, the price and availability of bullion will be much higher them. This is why I fill in for Another until "politics makes a grand stand" "for all to see". After that will begin the "real" bull market in "physical gold" that I believe will bring more Posts from him.

The whole reason behind this effort, is to implant what is evolving in our gold markets in peoples minds, before the fact. This market is "not as before" and has evolved several times during the past few years as the chess players are moved on the board. Truly, an international power and money
game that gold is but one aspect of. It may very well be the most profitable investment for our time, but it still remains only one act of a large play. For this segment, the eventual outcome will remain the same, the rejection of the modern dollar based gold marketplace and it's effects on all the industry that uses it.

If one knows where the fire exits are ahead of time, some will get out without getting burned. But, some still think gold derivatives (gold stocks included) amount to the same exits. When this market matures, they will find those doors locked. Even more so today than in years past, investors are finding this to be true. And the real fire hasn't even started yet!

So, don't worry about the ones that are well fixed in their overall investment mindset. They may not make a good exit, but exit they will. This world has a way of teaching old dogs new tricks.

Quality counts!
ALL:
Long ago society recognized the need to control "confrontation". The history of human behaviour demonstrated that "uncontrolled disagreement" always degenerated into it's lowest form of communication. War! Too avoid this, nation tribes responded with unwritten and unspoken "rules
of engagement". Early on, during individual field negotiations, generals would position themselves so their opponent could clearly see the large forces that stood behind their words. In other words talk came first, and if the rules of talking did not allow some common ground, a
ruthless slaughter would follow. After some bloodletting, they talked again.

Time and death forced a maturity of sorts upon the worlds social skills. It became apparent that human existence along with trade and commerce required lawful conduct to be extended to lawful talk. Without this, the trading of coherent thought was lost at the slightest disagreement. Of course, there would always be some that required a "physical removal" because they did not wish to be part of these national, state or private rules of discussion. We witness this today on the internet.

These "rules of engagement" marked the early stages of our progression to a "more civilized society". The rules were reworked many times and eventually became part of civil conduct on the individual level. Slowly, we created private person social rules and mores that limited just how far
we could take a "verbal disagreement" without evoking physical force upon each other. In addition, police were authorized to stop people from using "the verb age of location" from creating a "hostile environment" disruptive to the common good of all.

Yes, we have the right of "free speech" to say what we want "without slander", but we cannot say it anywhere one pleases if it breaks the rules of that location. We may not stand on an airport runway as we exercise our right. Highways (or freeways for the West coast), sea ports and
railways are all governed by these same rules of the road that some would even think infringe on their free speech. Still, "majority law" and national law rules where and how loud we may talk. As an example, one may not use a radio transmitter so large that it blocks out all other waves, in an effort to make your point.

Every "private" communication medium has rules and laws that govern how much we may "degenerate a conversation" before it creates a "hostile environment", causes "emotional pain" and eventually impedes the flow of discussion. Again, this action is in the "common good for all", in that
it affords us the other right. "The right of free choice"! Because of this, we today may choose to meet at a "town hall" or a "local church",,,,, a "gun shop" or a "protest meeting",,,,,,a dinner club or a local bar", each with it's own "verbal contact rules". The law says a restaurant owner may remove a person for conducting himself "out of fashion" from traditional clientele.

Today, the same majority law allows "private rules" to establish "private meeting sites" on the internet. As a people, we may "freely choose" to occupy our "place of discussion" in accordance to it's "owners rules". Indeed, the owner may fashion those rules in accordance to the clientele he may wish to attract. Using a business decision where demand creates the need, his "rules" can structure
the product offered as the continued success of a site dictates. Be it at the "USAGOLD town hall" or somewhere in the back alley, our freedom of choice is not jeopardized. Nor is our free speech lost as we may go where the "level of hostile environment" meets our needs.

To date, the incredible success of USAGOLD, indicates the demand and approval for the "private rules" and "private enforcement" that govern this site. Here we stand upon a stage and present our views to tens of thousands in the audience. An audience that packs the house and overflows into the streets to hear discussion of the logical progression of world events. Not the "slanderous" accusations of week minded children. My friends, we are on this stage before Centennial clients and mature adults of this world. They pay for their seat by offering their attention to our thoughts. Many have brought season tickets because the house rules create the format they seek.
Thank YOU Mr. Michael Kosares for your "rules of engagement" and supporting our right to choose!

In your post of: FOA (12/15/99; 19:54:05MDT - Msg ID:21108)

Hello JA, If you reread your post 21128, my reply will be more clear.

Our gold market is a confusing, non definable place for most people. Few have the immediate grasp of it that only 30+ years of eating, drinking and living gold can bring. On top of that, even fewer have accepted the impact that an "evolving" market can have on a static mind. Frozen in past
beliefs and concepts, modern long traders have been ruined as gold crosses an unimaginable gulf of time and space to regain it's roots as real money. Such are the days we witness in our time.

It would offer very little indeed, for us to stand on stage, puff our credentials and say, follow us because we know! In that crowd of "longs" there are perhaps hundreds, no thousands of gold security analysts that have lead their clients and friends down the road of "past performance tells us where we are going". Technical analysis, contrary opinion, supply and demand figures, traders commitments and yes, even future price inflation projections have left them all performing the duties of "managing their substantial, long term cumulative losses". The only group that has survived this ongoing transition are the "physical gold advocates". They have counselled against leverage and
espoused the use of real gold as a long term hedge against their other assets.

We have taken a step further and proclaimed that gold should be held as "real money" in a savings account concept. A concept supported by overwhelming evidence that the world's paper currency system is at the threshold of a major change. One of such scope that it has initiated the
world-wide buying of gold by large players that also hold this view. In this light these buyers of gold presently own an internationally accepted currency that is highly valued by the ECB nations as the Washington Agreement spells out. A currency who's exchange rate fluctuates only somewhat more
than many others. Still, a money that has the potential to become the best investment of the new millennium. And today the loses on this physical position pale in comparison to the performance of all it's derivatives.

As the world loses it's decades old reserve currency system, official gold usage will only accelerate as nations mark their holdings at an increasing premium to the leveraged paper gold markets. A premium that this modern market cannot match as it's magnitude will destroy their over extended equity. This process of discounting paper and building a premium on physical will become a visible example for citizen savers who wish to escape the effects that deleveraging a world will bring . International trading of physical gold will be used to fill the equity void a fallen dollar and fallen dollar paper gold market will leave. The initiation of returning to gold in an account settlement
function will drive the demand of physical gold and be a benefit of common people. Background gold currency will be held as a new paper digital currency takes the stage of account settlement. I believe the evidence points to the Euro as that digital money.

But who am I and why do we say all of this? I am the voice you cannot know, therefore cannot measure. The reader must build their own understanding of this as "events build the credibility", not our words. No favour will flow to us for your success! For, we believe that it was the wholesale,
blind following of accepted "Western money views" that created this generation of question less savers! They gained their understanding by accepting "past track records" and "credentials" instead of striving for their own reasoning ability. A mindset that is destine to lead to a massive loss of wealth as this unfolds.

You are offered more truth in these Thoughts than many will admit. We say that the major core Central Banks of the world are truthful when they give their gold statistics. Yet some say it was this CB gold that has covered the physical supply deficit. I ask, how can that be when the World Gold
Council figures show that most of the sold CB gold has stayed in their system over the last ten years? I say that this deficit is covered from the discarding of gold by Western investors as they exchange their real physical in return for modern gold derivatives holdings. The CBs only offered political backing for this to occur. One has but to examine the LBMA volume figures that Another said would verify this trend. It was noted that this form of trading would explode if gold went below $360. It did and it did as the London pool was several years ago forced to publicly offer their numbers! Today, others declare we are spinning a tail without proof and the CBs are lying.

Even today, the acceptance that CB gold is largely transferred within their system has turned the search for guilt to Fort Knox! Again, we state that the official gold stays put. I submit that the eventual acceptance that paper derivatives are at the heart of this problem will only confirm the eventual destruction of our beloved paper gold marketplace. A change that many in the industry "do not" want to happen. Once all other explanations are exhausted, all doubt will focus on this modern over leveraged marketplace. As official gold prices begin to climb, only then will the "loss of supply credibility" begin the paper discounting phase. Investors will realize the tremendous
leverage inherent in holding just one ounce of physical gold and attempt every means to demand delivery. From these paper markets they will find mostly cash payments that will greatly discount the ongoing physical price.

I openly state that the present paper gold marketplace is not the same as the physical gold market. This will become apparent as the paper market wildly fluctuates between $0 and $xxxxx, all the while discounting an ever increasing official and private physical gold price. Yet, the "static mind" of yesterday year cannot comprehend how physical gold can be priced in the thousands while paper gold contracts and the industry that depends on them fall away. Truly an example of the impact "western thought" has had on real values in our world. The grasping for bookkeeping entries of
account in an effort to save something that is nothing.

A bull market in physical gold is coming as this paper marketplace fails. Indeed, an even larger gold bull is coming after that, as "Reality" and "Modern Western Perception" converge. Here, at USAGOLD we will "watch this new gold market together". Truly, a market that is "not as before"!

Hello again Aristotle,
In light of what is being discussed I had to offer your wise words for review:

" " " The destination in any journey is always the easier vision to perceive than the forecast of details to be encountered in route to that destination." " "

Truly the road to super gold will offer interesting encounters! Also:

" " "My best advice to anyone pondering the future of Gold is to always remember that it is a globally recognized and utilized asset, and that not every person's experience and perspective (6 billion of them!) is the same as your own or that of your neighbor. Your perception of Gold could be rocked overnight by a development in China that you never saw coming." " "

Well, if it is intellectual combat I am engaged in then, I am woefully unarmed. Here's a thought on FOA/Another and OIL/GOLD:

Probably not in my lifetime (I'm 41) but oil will eventually be displaced as the #1 "resource" in the world by something else. What? You decide. Without even reading the article, I will agree that the role of oil in the world economy has been marginalized and diminished by the author's uppositions
simply for our conversation's sake. The Arabs know this. So, not only is it important for them to obtain REAL VALUE instead of FIAT for their oil product while the world turns, they have a strategy to utilize the REAL VALUE they've accumulated when the world's monetary reality goes into paradigm shift overdrive. I believe the ultimate end game is not for the ME to sit on their chips and continue to supply oil but rather, to become a dominant entity in world finance. Well, they have been for years if you read Aristotle in the HOF (petrodollars). They've simply traded one valuable resource in this lifetime for another to be deployed in ANOTHER lifetime. We're dealing with a lot
of wisdom here. Their genes go back over 5K years. What do you think? You have a better mind than me (in all honesty). Tell you what though; I strongly believe I'm right.

Sorry for the shabby thought processing. Perhaps the forum can help me out.

Hello Cavan Man ,
You are certainly taking a large jump ahead in our timeline, but this concept must be correct. I know Another has more imput on this your take may be some of it. I, personally think they will join the EMU eventually and use their oil, gold wealth to build a financial empire. Under the umbrella of a united europe, fairly priced oil could propel this entire block into this new millennium as a super commerce arena. We shall see!

Today's Gold Market Report: Gold Zooms Higher; Armstrong Closet Gold Bug (Literally)

Hello USAGOLD,
Armstrong is a good example of how many high profile people do own physical gold without the world press knowing it. The more money people have the more they buy gold insurance. And they do it in private, not because they are afraid of government controls, but because they want to buy
more at lower prices. It's only the leveraged gold bug that bemoans the falling price because it destroys the short term bet. Just like Farfel said, if the paper players ever grasp that this is a "house game" rigged against them, the market will zoom. Still, the odds are that they will ride the paper
train all the way down, without ever understanding it's a separate market.
I wish some readers would come out and discuss this without going into "overload". Myself and many other physical gold advocates are also "gold stock owners". Only difference is that our perception keeps us most fully in physical. The real gold stock boom will come after all the controls have impacted their current prices and gold is much, much higher. Then, even with official taxes and all, their profits will run up a great deal. Just not as much as current conditions will allow.
In any event, the worlds real money is into physical gold, waiting for the transition that must come. Does anyone really think the Bill Gates and W. Buffets of this world don't have a block of gold? It would not surprise me if Centennial was their broker! (smile)

Questions About America's Gold

Ph, I think just about every other major country (outside the IMF / dollar faction) has private audits of their gold. Too date, it's mainly been the US gold stocks that have worried people because the dollar is so leveraged over this holding. I understand that the gold is intact, but they don't want to draw attention to it. Any audit only highlights how little gold is backing the trillions of dollar assets. That's the reason for the stonewall.

Too a lesser extent, any audit carries overtones of eventual dollar backing. Something the BIS would have a major say in as they could attach it at the old $42 rate. Let's be serious here, if current international law demands the compensation of German slave labour and Swiss Gold value
reparations, all hell would break lose for the payment of dollar backed gold confiscated in 71. Both the official and private levels would be after any gold backing our present dollar. The only way the US gold could come into play would be with a new currency. And any whiff of that process (an
audit is the beginning) would literally tank the dollar big! Well before the fact. So, good luck to GATA and MR. Turk!

TownCrier (12/22/99; 13:16:51MDT - Msg ID:21505)

Hello TC,
You and ORO have opened this up. Below, I reword some of what was already said and add some things. In reality, the IMF could have just accepted a cash payment from Mexico and left gold out of that picture. Then they could revalue a separate portion of gold and issue equity to the BIS for poor country payments. This would have been much too great of a shock to the dollar system as it would openly appear that "gold" was saving the dollar! No, a slow boil allows the transition to work. See below.
Also, the IMF is keeping their gold at different valuations. Profits and loses on assets need not be totally realized. Only the items mobilized. By selecting this process of "revalue after use", it sets a long term precedent that allows the ECB to "transfer" gold from it's ECBMs OR the BIS can use available CB dollar reserves to buy gold at higher rates, as needed to mark the dollar lower!

ALL:
If everyone does not fully understand the IMF gold deals, that's ok. The IMF managers, who for the most part have long been dollar advocates, are still fighting about the real meaning of it themselves! They make statements, then backtrack. Make more statements, then backtrack again.
It's the same as when a politician makes a "clean explanation about policy" on a live camera; then realizes that by making this revelation public it may end one of his departments. Then they say's all sorts of strange things trying to cover their obvious (to them) slip of the tongue. The media falls all over the stage wires, trying to be the first to offer their assessment of the meaning of official words. In the process, the news wires are filled with conflicting, ridiculous accounts.

---------------------------------------------
Like this:

" " "WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund, raising cash to pay for debt relief, sold gold to Brazil this week and bought it back in a complicated deal." " "

Too put this into true life context:

Tell me this,,,,,,,,,,The last time one of you went into your bank and made a car loan payment, did any of you ever hear the banker tell his associate "Old Jim just came in and made his payment. I sure enjoy buying dollar from my customers in this fashion."

Now, in IMF context:

"Old Brazil just came in and made a payment on their loan using gold instead of paper currency. Yes, you heard me right! We " " brought " " gold from them"

----------------------------
Here is another one:

First in IMF context:

" " \`\`We sold slightly more than 7 million ounces of gold to Brazil and accepted it back immediately from Brazil for payment of an obligation due the same day,'' IMF Treasurer Eduard Brau said in a statement. \`\`Thus the gold did not enter the market.'' " "

Now in true life context:

" " " Old Jim just called and told us to use his saving account balance to TRANSFER cash into his checking account. Then he wanted us to withdraw from his checking to pay on the car loan. Thus the DOLLARS did not enter the market." " " (Didn't want anyone to worry that those dollars would be sold into the marketplace and depress it's value???)

-------------------------------------------------------

Get the picture?
By announcing these deals in this fashion, the whole process becomes lost in a twisted logic that forces us off the trail. Just as banks make currency payments and transfers "in house", they also do it with gold against currencies. And have been doing so quietly for a long, long time. The problem with the IMF action, is that it was forced out in the open by Euro advocates, "for everyone to see".
Even the congressional denial of IMF gold sales was presented as an effort to stop the price of gold from falling. In reality the IMF no longer had the support of Euro / BIS cash contributions. Without new wealth for the IMF to draw from, international dollar debts were going to fail. A process that would have quickly marked dollar assets to market. Deflation, is the word! Without new contributions, selling the IMF gold would have exposed the system. For, without gold, there was nothing else to "upvalue" for the purpose of maintaining dollar debt. And by extension, the use of the dollar as a reserve currency.
Indeed, a western public, completely unaccustomed to the thought of gold being used as money, has a hard time of grasping this. Let alone understanding it in the fashion as it is reported.
We think of dollars as a real value only because they continue to buy "things" at a relatively static price. All
thought is focused upon the amount of gold that CBs could sell and no consideration is given to the amount of dollars that could be sold. As gold continues it's journey to becoming an official "currency in the open", the public will make a comparison of outstanding dollars to "available outstanding gold". By available gold, we mean whatever gold the physical market will provide (sell) as backing for the dollar. Not how many paper gold contracts can (be created to) back the dollar, as is currently the fashion. As this understanding advances, the leverage inherent in just one ounce of gold will cause "thinking people" to run for physical, in mass! They will forget the present day need to leverage gold using risky paper derivatives. A need created because gold was not allowed to rise to match current dollar currency inflation (perhaps 18%??) Later, physical will be seen as more than enough.

Today, gold is once again being shown as an "official" wealth, currency and money asset; and it becomes such too the loss of the dollar.

" " The IMF, acting as a bank, can issue cash in amounts equal to booked financial assets that include country bonds and loans - and gold. Gold reserves are the only way a bank can issue cash that is not backed by debt." " "


ORO, TC:
The IMF currently holds loan paper as assets. Once paid with revalued gold, that portion of gold is held as the new asset. It replaces the portion of the loan "taken down" with that payment. So, the dollar portion of this loan does disappear, just as in a cash payment. Yet, the dollar supply is maintained as the "cash dollars" the country used to buy the gold, is used to maintain other dollar debt. That being the "fund" at the BIS that's used for poorer countries. It was essential for the BIS to pull the dollars away from the IMF bookkeeping so as to keep the dollar floating, if you will. A destroyed currency does not float against anything and creates havoc. A floating system, "in transition" can slowly reflect new values in the marketplace. All along, this has been the goal of the ECB/BIS. Transition the dollar reserve system so as to allow dollar asset holders time to hedge.
Today, this message arrives at your doorstep, on this forum. Consider it well.

Further:

Again, This process is a major blow to the dollar as it introduces gold back into the system. And does so by showing gold as a growing reserve currency alternative! By using gold in this manor, it precludes a deflation of the dollar system by slowly marking down the value of dollars by raising the official price of gold. And doing this outside the valuations of the paper gold marketplace In effect,
new dollar inflation is not created, where as the existing dollar currency inflation is maintained and slowly becomes apparent in the gold price! Yes, rising official gold prices, in dollars, will eventually lead to price inflation, but only to the extent that "real goods prices" were not evident in our present world dollar money supply.
Note: The "money pump" term ORO uses to lable this is more like a pump that keeps our system floating. Again, in Western eyes, it's wildly price inflatiobnary. Yet, in reality it only turns lose the price inflation the dollar already has built in! ORO, your view yes? No?
The current dollar reserve system has hidden these "true gold prices" and "real goods prices" for many years. The above process will allow the orderly transferee out of this system without imploding the banking sector through deflation. Only dollar asset holders will lose wealth. But, as I offered before, it is wealth they never had in the first place. We own only a bookeeping entry that described what one "could buy" as long as everyone doesn't buy together. Looking closely, we can now see how "physical" gold dollar inflation will "lead" dollar goods price inflation. The end of a reserve system requires such a transition. A reverse transition most gold bugs do not expect.
All of this brings us back to the present price setting mechanism for gold. The LBMA. Their entire paper gold marketplace cannot survive a return of gold as official money. Reflecting the present world dollar inflation in dollar gold prices will wreck this market and most of the mining companies that need it as a financing tool.
As we walk this trail of gold, official gold transfers will first mimic the paper price. Then, they will exceed the market as they are labelled "premium trades". Then, the paper discounting will begin as "premium bullion" in the public dealer market no longer allows paper to be "marked to the market".

Gold, the only investment needed for the next thousand years!

Hello Leigh,
My reply to your comments / questions:

-----I have a few questions to ask, and I hope you don't mind if they seem to cover old ground. I'm trying to clear up some fogginess in my understanding. First, regarding the proposed three world currencies -- will they be gold backed (like the Euro), based on a true gold standard, or backed by nothing at all? Will the three currencies compete against one another? Do you think that eventually the three currencies will merge into one world currency?-------

-----------Also, you've mentioned about digital money, and I assume you mean that a gold owner's gold is placed in the bank and he can draw upon its value. What if the gold owner (or cash owner) doesn't trust the bank or the government to take good care of his money? Could he refuse to use the smart card and function on a cash basis?----------------


Leigh,
Let's take a short walk.

I don't propose three world currencies and neither do our Euroland friends. There is only room for one world reserve "digital" currency that would take on the trade settlement functions of our present dollar system. We understand that the Euro alone will become that "digital settlement reserve currency".

The Euro is not and never will be gold backed like the various gold standards of the past. The ECB / BIS have no intentions of making that mistake again. The whole reason for allowing gold to return to it's free market "physical" price value is to use it as a background official / private
currency. A real money (gold) that will trade at whatever level it seeks because "this new" Euro currency will not be defined in a set amount of bullion. It's price (gold) will rise as a function of world supply and demand based on gold held and used as a "wealth asset", not it's commodity use.
"Wealth asset" money is an old line function gold has always had throughout history. This use exists today, even as it's value is hidden in the fiction of a "paper gold" marketplace. This "Wealth money" is the very attribute the Western financial system has so much tried to destroy as it competes against the retention of our debt structure. A structure ingrained in the dollar world and requires that
no one discount dollar debt.

The old gold standards needed gold to completely back their moneys because without gold, they (cash) had no purpose of exchange. Except to denominate a fixed gold transfer during trade. Today, modern commerce has evolved to the point that paper "digital" settlement is the cornerstone
of an efficient trading system. Indeed, without international computer settlement, using fiat currencies, our system would not function. Too this end, our modern commerce and lifestyles require "digital" currencies and that need imparts a new value to their use and existence. One that did not exist during the relative "slow society" of the gold standard days.

Therefore, this modern reserve "digital paper currency" will not be backed using a fixed amount or price of gold, rather it will "use gold" as a real money reserve. A reserve that can be traded, lent or retained as national savings. As such, any world "free market" value rise of gold will only be seen as an "good" increase in savings and therefore better "reserves" for a national society. Not to mention any "physical gold savings" held by the private citizen. Contrast this with the today's Western view that any rise in the gold price means a loss of wealth and a economic disaster. Truly, this will not be a disaster for the majority of world citizens. Just those that tie their saving assets into the illusion a dollar presents.

The modern reserve currency will be in demand for trade settlement in conjunction with gold, but will not be in competition with it. Their values will move up and down against each other using their true attributes. Gold as a "real wealth settlement money of slower speed" and Euros as a "modern digital money of high speed".
Our modern currency history (the last 20 years) has shown that the world needs both of these moneys, but needs them in a different format from the past. Our present dollar could do the same but it carries the baggage of huge unpayable international and local debts. Debt made non payable by the dollar reserve system that forces the social needs of just one people upon upon the world using unbalanced, rigged exchange rates. It eliminates the escape route of a "free market" gold price and therefore locks down the ability of other nations to trade outside this system. Free the world of this system and a great deal of American wealth will be seen for what it really is, an illusion of
bookkeeping. Indeed, create a workable reserve medium, based on world needs and wants in a settlement format and the race will be on to use your product. I submit that that product is in the process of being built today. A return to a new one world currency is the best thing for all of us.
Especially if it "includes" the money the world has wanted for all it's history. Gold!

Onward:

Mr. Holtzman, does not understand how the diversity and different social nature of Euroland will become it's most profound currency strength. It they were a more homogenizing people like the US, the Euro would become just another dollar! Their "Old World", "Hard Money" conflicting nature will be reflected in a "New Gold Market" and a responsible world currency. Their practical "Real World" focus will not allow them to reject this "digital currency" as we move forward in world trade. The very best balance for the next 1,000 years.

National states and broad based cultures, such as China and India will wholeheartedly embrace such a system. The prospects of using the Yen in such a world demonstrates the lack of understanding about how that currency and it's society functions. More later.

"The whole reason for allowing gold to return to its free market physical price value is to use it as a background official/private currency". Hello FOA. Isn't gold an official/private currency for central banks, ME oil, large blocks of wealth etc today? What I mean to say is; gold for those "in the know" and fiat for the masses? Thanks.

-----------------------------------------------

Happy Y2K C Man (and to everyone (smile),

Consider Historic Reality:

Yes, gold has for some time been accumulated as a savings / reserve currency by people "in the know". What do they know as opposed to the masses? They understand how gold gains in value directly in proportion to the amounts a currency is inflated. Even though the long term inflation of
our paper money has yet to be reflected in real goods prices, gold holds these gains "before the fact" of this price inflation. Hidden from view to the masses, these (gold) gains date back decades and form a kind of savings account that always balances once the currency begins it's final timeline.

A Dangerous Trail; walked by many people nations in the past:

The quest to "get something for nothing" is what the modern "Western View" is built upon. Sold by a political machine, this concept nourishes this grand illusion. An illusion that requires leveraged paper wealth administered by a super leveraged paper currency. This quest for wealth from leverage is what drives the "Fiat for the masses" mentality.

We Walk This Trail Today:

The balancing of this "Western" bubble by a revaluing of the currency will not break the dollar system as most think. The US and it's dollar will continue, yet it's only the illusion of this bubble wealth that will meet world reality. That reality will be in the form of a super price inflation that demonstrates the real buying power of "something for nothing" saving / investing! Denominating your wealth in today's dollars is like numbering your savings with commodity futures contracts. Truly Dollar credibility is completely dependent on others delivering physical goods against our dollar contract when we demand real delivery! Many will find their dollar assets in "Force Majeur" from this new and changing world.

The Leverage Of Physical Gold Against Dollars; it dwarfs the grasp of a Western Mind:

Today, the (gold) price making function of the dollar based gold market is affording the opportunity to trade an "illusion of nothing" for "something". A process of lowering the paper price of gold until physical delivery is no longer an option. All in an effort to buy time for the dollar. We may have already reached that point (dollar price) where physical gold will be purchased no lower.
Or more Western gold hoards may yet come to market in exchange for the fraud of paper gold. In time, the holders of leveraged gold paper will find themselves caught in a maelstrom of events that crush the the entire concept of our modern gold market. This firestorm will burn through any entity that makes this marketplace it's financial lifeline. We have seen only a tiny beginning of this today.
When the gold market break's, it (the rushing price of dealer physical gold) will lead the downturn of the dollar and mark the great price inflation that follows. Gold will run in dollars as never before seen in history. It will become the investment few "Americans can understand". A
savings account already full with the years of interest and gain. All equal to the past printing and leveraging of dollars world-wide. As a people, citizens of Western Thought and investing concepts are free to choose their future wealth. Some will buy a value that is not expressed today, yet as real tomorrow as rain from clouds in the spring.

PERMAFROST (12/29/99; 3:21:27MDT - Msg ID:21765)
FOA Msg ID: 21734
Dear Sir, Based on your logic, two outcomes are possible.
1) If you're right and we are witnessing the re-monetization of gold than all those that benefited from the fiat money scheme will lose their power. ------------------

Mr. Frost,
Not all of them! Only the ones that did not hedge their power effectively. Surely the Euro will carry some of the same political agendas the dollar currently does. Only, it will be controlled more so by the cross currents evident in the various old world countries. Let's face it, we all need a dollar like currency if our modern economy is going to function. What we don't need is a single reserve
currency that precludes any avenue of escape if it hurts other countries.
If gold is trading in a free physical market, no one is going to run to gold as a single currency and leave the Euro entirely. Indeed, a free world economy needs and demands a currency that can expand and contract with changing conditions. The curse of the old gold standard was that it didn't allow this latitude and always created a crisis when needs required this flexible money supply. Only a separate gold market can offer a means to truly measure the success of the money creating treasuries. This is the direction we are heading, for better or worse.

-----------A gold backed and restrained financial system (An oxymoron, in my belief) will simply preclude them from accumulating goods and services against monopoly money -- the source of their power.--------------

Well, the power you speak of can also be held through the use of gold itself. Many a king and monarch ruled the land with the effective use of bullion. Your oxymoron is not in the restraint of the monopoly money, rather in the present lack of a free choice between "gold wealth" and "dollar
wealth". The blending of these concepts will create a new power block that must conform to the needs of all.

----------2) If you're not and gold is merely being used as a relatively-untapped "new" source of non-debt-backed dollar creation, than it's a very old game we're playing, indeed. Was not gold itself responsible for one of the greatest INFLATIONARY explosions in History when the Conquistadors "expropriated" Aztec gold and brought it all to Europe to consume (chaseafter) a "limited amount of goods and services"? Colombus turning over in his grave? -------------

During the time of the Conquistadors, we must consider that goods were not being inflated in price, rather gold was being devalued! At the very least gold did not disappear as bank notes do. No, the coming run in gold will be a reflection of the tremendous dollar inflation already in the system. It's only in the eyes of the Western dollar saver that this price inflation is unwarranted. Again, they are
only loseing something they never had. An illusion of wealth on a grand scale.

------QUESTION: Do you know of any emperor (I think you called them 'Grandees' here on this forum) who's willingly abdicated power--Besides God himself?------------

My friend, power belongs to the swift of heart and mind. This world waits for no one as power flows from peoples to peoples. Even the strongest emperor knows to occupy the high ground before the flood. The powerful in tomorrow's future will own gold today.

Hello FOA and, Many Thanks
Please consider this:
I am 42. Will I live to see it and perhaps enjoy the knowledge that I made the right decision???????????

Cavan Man,
42? Oh boy, I didn't know you were so old! Well, at that age one should be careful with your body. Get plenty of rest, eat well and take your vitamins. If lucky, one could live another 40 or 50 years! (big smile)
Seriously, it was so long ago that I passed that age I lost the records. And for the record, I know I'll see this gold change. So, all in all, you don't have to live long enough to see the next gold bull, "you just have to outlive me"!! Ha Ha (huge great big smile!)

Happy new year CMan.

Paranoid Thinking Runs Amuck Here!
Now a year later i still have an enormous amount of respect for your knowledge about Gold. Yet, I still respectfully say, the World markets are just to big and to unpredictable for one person to know with any certainty.------------------

Hello Golden Truth,
Reading all of your post tells me the (non physical) gold markets have been rough on you. I can understand your feelings if you can grasp what groups we are talking to.

All of Another's Thoughts and my comments are directed toward "physical gold owners and by extension "physical gold advocates". These people have read all of these ongoing posts (some have been involved privately long before the current "gold forums stage") and know the thinking is
strategic as it applies to a moving, evolving political target! Each group of posts are but a snapshot in time as it applies to this changing chess game. Yet, the end results remains the same, the destruction of our present pricing system for gold, a huge increase in the dollar price of physical gold, the eventual use of gold a Euro reserve settlement currency along with the new free market that must evolve with it.

"Physical Gold Advocates", such as I (and readers) have brought gold from the high $360s into the low $280s because of this ongoing timeline of events. A timeline that is now quickly being depleted as the Euro builds it's position in the world. I submit, we are not hurting in any comparable
way as our gold holdings are in a good large proportion to our total assets. And certainly our asset values have not been impacted as the gold derivatives players have (gold stocks included). When behind the stage power plays are in progress, the possible short term outcome is presented. Yet, it is presented with the knowledge that readers will think bullion, not derivatives. As such, if the chess game moves into another stage, no hard loses are taken by anyone.

ALL:
The historical record of physical gold alone is enough to justify a real gold holding. I add that the record for mining shares and the other leveraged derivatives are lacking in their long term comparison. These items are as new and peculiar to the modern investment scene as is the current dollar "off the gold standard"! Players often tout these paper investments to be as good as gold, yet they are truly only as good as the dollar marketplace for gold! Still, I own some gold shares (gold), but only in a small proportion.

We conclude that the coming bull market in gold will be unlike anything before it. Today, the leverage is in physical gold, not paper gold. This latter day track record of derivatives, gold stock options, gold options, gold stocks, etc. all clearly demonstrate this changing function. The horrendous ongoing, long term loses, built up by these paper bull traders is evident. With each downturn, they search for greater and greater leverage, in a attempt to return to "even". All the while, the bullion buyer slowly amasses a large "highly leveraged" position, just by channelling his would be trading loses into paid up physical and rare gold coins.

One day, the dollar paper gold markets will be driven into "Force Majeure", during a transition from the current dollar reserve system. With each political announcement, the stress on the London market will grow. We know this position and understand it well. Yet, no one can guess when the
last bullion delivery will spell the end for paper credibility. I only offer the month by month level of stress and how it may impact bullion.
As for this Y2K item. I fully acknowledged it potential for impact on the dollar. Yet, in my posts, I offered my feelings that it would not be severe. Clearly, we have larger items to address that this.

More later. FOA

Well, if you have come this far down the gold trail, we might as well finish the hike.
The end of this is closer than many think. My dad always said don't worry about the big bully in town. There is always someone bigger and tougher than him wait for the chance to ?????
The same is true in the money power game. I never said that the Euro was not going to be a tough "dude". He is and he will work the dollar over with the help of gold. We are only pointing out (to the average person) that the timeline of the dollar is ending and the transition will be sudden and harsh on dollar asset holders. Truly, gold will not be an "innocent" bystander in this fight. It's historic power to break empires will certainly come into full use.
Again, bullion will be the survivor with the most leverage in this battle. Yes, the gold mines will still have valuable reserves and be in full operation as this all unfolds. It's only the equity holdings of these "businesses" (not all, just most of them) that will be ransacked as the gold marketplace is up-ended.

No, G.T. I am the one who thanks you for telling us what you think and how you feel. And doing so without using a sword to try and cut my head off (as some have done)! Truly, all the success, wealth and social standings are lost if we as people cannot clearly air our thoughts without physical

No one can walk this gold trail without a modern, updated map. And no one can read this map without a good understanding of the road signs that daily events create. Further, human understanding is developed by allowing ourselves to weigh "reason", by viewing these new events
as others see them. Not just accepting them in the light of past performance.
Things change, life evolves and so too do the reasons and motives for gold. In this respect, oil influence has played a major roll in the evolution of our gold markets. Not to mention the birth and success of the Euro. There will be much more on this later.

Series of posts....

Hello USAGOLD,
I have really enjoyed your recount of the Golconda writings. How true to modern life it is.

Philosophically thinking about our present situation; the current run up in the stock market is a perfect end to a long play. This mad rush to buy anything at any price is indicative if a financial order run amuck. I am struck at how the same process is repeated again and again by our Fed,
each time with greater intensity. Starting with the 1982 Mexican default and the Dow at 700+/-, the federal reserve pushes money into the system. Right into this present day, each and every possible threat to the dollar system is addressed with a more intense cash flood. Now the flood
becomes outright and open with little consideration of the eventual repercussions.
Yet, the entire population accepts this illusion as real wealth for the long term. Truly, a mass of deluded opinions ripe for reality.

Further,

I could not agree more with your #21977! In present time, the Washington Agreement has turned the "Thousand ton Gap" into a ticking time bomb. Even before the agreement, stocks of gold were being drawn down. I have often stated that this gap was being filled by private gold holders
exchanging old line physical for derivatives. Because this process was backed by the CBs, there partial withdrawal from the business has set off a mad scramble in the BB camp. Far from the past official leasing announcements and sales, guarantees were hidden from view. This loss is the real
story behind the market facade. The recent small official announcements to lend by other countries indicates that we are at the end of private stock supplies. I expect that the "gap" will now work it's magic in short order.
How this will end in a pricing format is completely uncertain to many. The world has never had to wait out a transition from paper into physical. Usually, it's been the other way around (the dollar in 71). We watch for physical to move as paper becomes frozen. We shall see.

Question re Remedies for US Breach of Contract
This is open to the entire Forum, though it may be of particular interest to FOA.

Hello Canamami,
Your thoughts:
--------Is it possible to distinguish between pre-August 1971 Bretton Woods/gold-backed dollars and post-1971 dollars? It would seem that only those dollars which existed prior to August 1971 represent a breach of contract by the US. ---------

I have to put your items in context. Why would it be important to separate the pre and post gold backed dollars? That was not the thrust of the logic presented. The point was that foreign entities would take the US to task in trying to reclaim their gold at $42 per dollar. Simple international contract law does not allow the same contract to be honoured today and not yesterday?? Our present dollars have not changed in legal interpretation from their beginning. Only the Treasury committed an outright default by not supplying gold back then. Truly, the government should have reissued a new currency at the time of default.
Today, any return to backing the dollar with gold would open up a can of worms for the US. Especially in light of the success of the German and Swiss WW2 payments. Again, the whole reason for pointing this out is to highlight the political repercussions from backing the dollar with gold. Many suggest such an avenue and we point out that a new currency would have to be printed to avoid this. It's just another reason why an argument for backing the dollar with gold is impossible and dollar assets are at risk. The US gold stocks valued at any price will not save the dollar.


------Further, even on a purely moral basis, given that the rest of the world accepted US dollars after the 1971 breach of contract, would such acceptance constitute a waiver of the breach, thereby nullifying even a moral claim to US gold? ------------

Would the US risk such a move using this light argument as a loophole? I doubt it and so do a lot of others.

--------Moreover, it appears that by the early 1960's the world knew that the dollars outstanding exceeded the gold backing, yet the world continued to use the dollars? Again, the world accepted the US dollars knowing there was realistically no gold backing, thereby nullifying the moral
claim.---------

So, in the same light, if the world stopped paying off dollar debts they could not pay, does this action nullify the moral claim that everyone should pay dollar debts? Further, if you buy a junk bond that is trading without payments, does your purchase relinquish the issuers obligation to pay you any interest? This logic does not work in your presentation or mine as offered.

-------Does not the continued prominence of the US dollar reflect value to US currency which stems from more than mere "gold backing" or "acceptance for oil settlement"?---------

I ask you, does not the high level of the US stock market reflect it's prominence rather than mere earnings or rational P/E ratios? Truly, the mind in a crowd thinks the common thought, no? Again, Western views are skewered by group acceptance of the contract that "bookkeeping entries" are representing real wealth. It's a fragile view that can be fractured from the competition of a less leveraged alternative. The Euro!


------(Kindly note I am not diminishing the possible importance of the Euro as a competitor to the dollar, or that at some point the huge overhang of foreign held US dollars and the trade deficit will have an impact. ---------

It is impossible for the production of any country to support it's currency if it's currency always flows "out" in a trade deficit. In this country, the negative effects of a reversal of this long term trend will bring on a dollar currency crisis that runs the price of gold well before local price inflation. This is the primary reason why recent investment profits will never transition into gold before it overtakes the illusion of these realized gains. This is the focus of our "reasoning" and push for the purchase of
gold "before the fact". Gold will run well before price inflation is evident (in a large degree). And before resource stocks create an up-trend based on this performance. All in conjunction with a severe downturn in local equity markets that will overwhelm all forms of paper investments (gold stocks included).
Yes, we may see minor runs in these areas prior to the crisis, but these moves will not be connected with the major bull market in gold that is coming.

The gold "subculture" - Reply to Number Six, koan

-------------------

In the future we will read of the paper gold "subculture" that invested mostly in gold derivatives instead of gold. Even with the leverage of mining shares clearly working against them, this group will be questioned as to why they stayed the course. I suspect that they will eventually be buying gold at ever increasing prices, kicking and screaming all the while. Eventually enjoying the benefit of the only way to beat this dollar manipulated marketplace. Physical gold.
I never thought that I would see the day when investors brought into a business that tried to sell it's product (gold) down?? And defended their action with more suggestions to buy! Then when someone suggested to change their investment mix to buy mostly the product (gold) and less the business (mining),,,,,a move I add that would drive the product (gold) price up,,,,,,,,,,,,,that logic is
attacked with pitchfork and fire?????????? Indeed, this logic does belong in a "subculture".

Mr Gresham (01/02/00; 02:30:24MDT - Msg ID:22030)
FOA -- 30k?

++++++++++++++++++
Good stuff Gresham! Re-read your post for a refresh then come here. This is something we can air out. I'll just rummage around some and see if any of this hits home. Will place some of your post comments inline where usable.

Two additional observations came into play years ago when this whole timeline was being worked out. One of them:

---A major flaw in the fiat system was in selling people the idea that money need not be wealth.--

This is something Martin Armstrong pushed a great deal in his pronouncements. I made an open post to him on this forum because his position was in direct conflict to human nature. Lo and behold his personal clandestine actions later proved out my point. Truly, most modern thinkers don't trust
contract fiat money and understand "things" much better. Only they try to hide their perceived weakness. Indeed, he quietly owned a bunch of gold!

Onward:

In real life, everything is our wealth and simultaneously our money. Houses, cars, furniture, pots
pans, you name it, it's all tradable in a duel format as money. In fact real things were what people traded in the beginning. Modern economist love to regress this function and use the term "barter" in a way that "dirties" it in the eyes of modern educated man. The use of things as money has always been the natural way people trade and the most understandable method to compare value by applying an "efforts to acquire" worth to unlike items.
Advancements in our infrastructure brought on the need to use contract wealth (receipts for delivery) as a means to trade efficiently. (You know, the old receipts for gold in the vault story bankers started.) Over time we lost the grasp that by using money to buy and sell real wealth we
were still just trading real wealth as in the beginnings. Only now we are using money to denominate the trade. Again, modern economists contradict the facts by trying to convince us we are really trading dollars, not the wealth they represent. As if I buy a house from you, I get the house and you get the dollars as the end trade. In reality you have only taken what the dollars can buy, "real wealth", not the subjective paper value. I could have just as easily given you ten cars for the house and we both would know exactly where we stood.

So, in a larger sense the entire world economy is in effect trading "things wealth" for "things wealth". The nation state's moneys have nothing to do with how rich we are. Today, the grand illusion of paper money has evolved into -------we equate our life savings with how much we can
buy, not how much we have------. The concept holds little reason for most people to worry as long as the world works. But, if the world changes, our savings are suddenly not what our wealth really is!

Further:

The second flaw arrives in the form of: --------"currency inflation slowly transforms fait money into a futures contract"-------
In a broad sense, IF the money supply is created in "lock step" with the ability of the economy to produce, everyone could take their money and buy a "newly made" item the first day,,,,,,, And the persons that received those paper dollars could turn around and buy another "newly made" item the next day and so on. In time, more and more items would come into ownership and there possible supply on the resale marketplace would increase. But, as the money supply was only fixed to the new production ability these increases in real goods, the increase supply of "owned" goods in the
marketplace would drive up the value of paper money.

This would not be a problem except that our money makers decided to name this affect "deflation" as the paper value of goods in existence fell as the money value rose in direct converse fashion. This process would not effect anyone if it was a known effect that everyone planned for. But bankers and governments never plan for it nor do they want it.

So, along the way path to money inflation, someone decided that the money supply should increase in somewhat matched step, not only with the production of new goods, but rather with the total supply of owned goods. This was accepted as good economic practice and it's application
ordained an ever increasing world money supply to match the perceived world wealth in existence. Our constant building money supply is always viewed as a good thing. Indeed it is even a major component of all relative tools that measure our economy. An illusion that says "if our money is
increasing, our economic system is growing". Again, at the very least, this guaranteed that the value of money would not "increase" on it own (hence the need for a "return" on cash in the form of interest) and the money denominated value of "goods" would not deflate. But, perceptions changed
and the process evolved further.

In time, the perceived purchasing power (and worth) of dollars was extended to include what goods could be produced and therefore brought in the future. Not just today's production plus the existing supply of owned things, but also future delivery from a perceived infinite economic
production base. This is where they justified the long term, massive debt build-up that has leveraged our economy far into the future. And done so on a scale unknown to mankind.

In effect, the world has accepted a money supply that created a money supply in gross excess of the worlds present things. Truly, this present reserve system does not price our real wealth of today, rather it prices our "perceived" wealth today as if it is produced or purchased today. Yet,
this "real trade" for "real wealth" cannot happen until far in the future. This is the fundamental reason why dollar inflation on a massive scale has not produced a matched price for wealth owned today. People hold the ideal that any amount of US debt is as good as "real wealth in the bank", also known as "money in the bank". All the while lacking the grasp of any tools to measure just how far out of reality "existing debt money" is in relation to what it can buy, in mass.

-------------Your words:----They see it as wealth storage, FOA says. It also turns out to be a wise use of Gresham's Law, encouraging the use of a wisely-managed ("I only have to run faster than you," said the Euro to the Dollar) fiat currency in trade, and keeping the gold slightly off-stage
(or well-displayed in the bank window as in the old wildcat banking days in US) for effect in earning world respect. Kind of trying to blend the best of 19th & 20th centuries. ---

Our present financial structure and debt leverage was built on a platform that said " " "the dollar would always be credible as a "contract money" far into the future. Lost in this credibility is the risk that any move from world dollar use would force this contract into a bookkeeping change that revalued the dollar in present tense. In other words, a huge price inflation that matched the dollar to
current goods and production. Such a change has happened to other currencies and peoples all through history as money power moves from nation to nation. Only never before was it done when gold had not "marked to the market" the currency value loss on a regular, ongoing basis before the fact. Today, this transition of real wealth buying power from a single reserve system to another will force the dollar price of gold to soar to levels, we cannot understand. From this stance we can understandy why many have viewed gold as a riskless holding that will be revalued. If it was part of
your mix, the transition would always make up for any return lost from not holding other assets. Indeed, it is the very untimate in a super leveraged investment. No other currency today could expect a 1,000% to 10,000% rise in value against the dollar, none.

Now, if one can look closely we understand the need for gold in the background of a new reserve currency. Only gold has the ability to carry the load of this perceived wealth transfer without a catastrophic loss of world economic process. And do so in a format as common as any stock of treasury bill asset. Gold at $10,000+ will be as common as Yahoo at $400+. Just like a US treasury bill at $10,000 face, one ounce will be just another "money in the bank"!

-------Your words again: -----Most of us would settle for protection against inflation of things in general, in a time of crisis. And that is something we assume gold would give us, whether the inflation increment turns out to be 2x or 10x. FOA says the dollar supply is out there for the 10x
inflation of things in general (?), but is the same pool of dollars being "counted twice", once to go into things in general and the other into gold as a default crisis insurance?--------------

My friend, count it at least once+ for the present and ten times+ for the future. This will match the lost future buying power of dollars held in savings today. Then you will know where the real dollar value of gold in transition lies.

Thanks Mr. G..
My #22048 was a hard complicated piece to produce. After reading it again I saw many spelling and english usage mistakes. But I hope it offered a springboard for concept. I'll write it again more clearly if you want.

This perception is the basic foundation that has fuelled the drive for a new reserve currency. Even if this only amounted to an establishment of another like the dollar (without the lineage of debt for baggage). Understand the reasoning in this and we can clearly see where the dollar was going without any political leverage to change the US course. A world wide hyperinflation that would impact every economic aspect of world trade. Today, that same inflation results will be contained by devaluing the dollar in gold with another reserve currency available for use in international settlement and reserve holdings. Instead of a world-wide event, the effects will be mostly felt only in
countries that have little gold and no Euroland trade reserves. Yes, the US has some gold, but this limited amount is frozen from effective use by the "duality" of the dollar. Today, the dollar is a citizen of two worlds even as the gold that must back it belongs "politically" to the a single
American people. There can be no clean resolution of this as we can't print a new money and we can't back the one we have.

Granted, this transition will amount to a financial paper deflation and goods price hyperinflation in some of the largest economies (US, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc.), but the majority of the worlds population will be somewhat shielded.
I am jumping way ahead of the fact here and should wait for political motives to set gold on this new trend line. But, I feel many here will understand this now. We shall see.

FOA - Pump

Hello ORO,
Your follow up post about the IMF money pump was very interesting. You state: ----- You are indicating (FOA), it seems, that the current consensus in the G20 is that the dollar reserve system should be allowed to slowly dissolve into cash full oblivion. --------

Yes, offering this analysis from the view that the dollar is being driven into a "cash position" is right on the mark. In hind sight, this would be the only way to prevent the reserve currency from deflating through the obliteration of world dollar debt. Further, as the Euro takes a larger and larger portion of debt financing, the left over dollars holders are forced into an ever more short term maturity. If you were a dollar holder and could see the transition ahead, you would not want to lend long either. This effect is well understood looking backwards, as it was usually caused from the Fed tightening credit. Today, the squeeze (on longer term dollar credit) comes from a perception that this market may be falling away. Making room for the Euro. Eventually culminating in an "almost cash" position for the dollar, the fastest moving currency derivative of them all.
I think this has to be the first stage of "flight" before a true gold run begins. This is the period where no past guidelines direct the trading. Everyone is looking around and saying, what are you going to do? Most will shorten maturities offered and feed slowly into the Euro and gold as a hedge. As you know my thoughts about the paper gold market; the enormous sums of floating dollars will easily crush this illusion. Long before any significant paper is exercised into physical gold that market will discount cash price in a big way and close.
Back to your thinking; notice how the Fed is still pumping money even after the year turn over! The liquidity squeeze is arriving and it has nothing to do with price inflation, Y2K or the stock markets. Another force is at work in the world today and it is attacking the dollar behind the bushes. You mentioned the Japanese and Eu banks in the carry trade. The Japanese are and always have been up to their eyeballs in US paper. They have to stay this way because of their dollar trade deficit. As they continue to decend into deflation, the strong Yen still locks their hands from selling our debt and the BOJ has always known this. So, they continue to add dollar reserves on balance with this deficit in an effort to keep the Yen from rising even higher and killing their US market share. These people are done in and will eventually print Yen (hyperinflate) in and effort to match any US dollar price inflation. Locked step to the end! The EU can play the carry game as long as they hedge in Euros (or gold) because it will balance the dollar fall. They will some day be seen borrowing Euros at 4% (??) and buying Eurodollars at 30% (??) or something like that. What else can be done with the eventual pool of Eurodollars floating offshore the US? It will already have
been devalued against gold and they will still want to trade with the US. After working through Exchange Rate controls that is.

ORO, more clearly, the period directly before us will be like a fiction book. Good reading, but I don't believe this is happening! Once the Euro gets it's legs, there will be no use for a Eurodollar holding as long as the US keeps it's trade deficit wide open. As the dollars flood in, we cannot
spend them in Europe because we will have to buy Euros first. As the existing Eurodollar holdings go further into cash mode their value must fall. And fall big!
These paper bullion boys at the front desk talk about all the excess ECB gold that must be sold. They are going to sound like the Y2K bugs after the fact. When the ECB and the BIS start moving unneeded reserve dollars for official bullion (this has started already) off market, we will see it in the US % rates (like today) and the Exchange rates (like today). The real bugs in 2000 are going to be in the paper gold market. Just watch it all unfold!

On borrowed time?... Last but not least, I want to share something that Dennis Gartman wrote late last week when I was out. It is the perfect period piece to capture the mood of what is really going on. To any sane person, it should be frightening; but then again, anyone who's frightened isn't having any fun. And those who are not frightened are making gobs of money speculating their heads off. Here's what Dennis said:

"As a final aside for the year, we went to our local branch bank yesterday to transact some business [Ed. Note: we actually got some cash for the Y2K \`turn'...just in case!], and spent some time chatting with the branch manager. She does not know what business we are in, so when we asked her if she'd seen any increase in personal loans she replied out of hand that indeed she had. Indeed, the personal loan demand at her branch had escalated rather substantively.

"She then proffered that the sole reason for the sharp rise in personal loans was the investment in the stock market. She said that local doctors, lawyers, farmers, auto dealers... all of the leading figures of the local economy (and their wives) had been in recently to borrow money to \`put into the market.' We asked her how long this had been going on, and she said that the branch had been making personal, signature loans like that for some while, but that the demand had really escalated in the past several months and has really become \`hot' in the past several weeks. She
wondered if it was too late for her to join in the market's enthusiasm!

We said, \`We don't know,' and left bemused and afraid.

"It is perhaps not new news, but we find it odd that the public is borrowing money on signatures without collateral (other than CDs and/or sizeable demand deposit accounts) that is then used to buy stocks, very probably upon margin. The leverage is immeasurable, for the public is apparently \`Reg-T'ing' money that it has already borrowed with nothing down. She said that those who've been borrowing the most indicated that they \`could get more out of the market than the interest charge,' and considered it unwise not to take advantage of the circumstance.

"Friends and clients, if this is not rampant, tulip - bulb' - like speculation of the worst sort, we've no idea what is. Of all of the things that we've read about, heard about and discussed at length concerning the mania that is the U.S. stock market, this is the most manic of all. When speculation comes to small-town southern Virginia, it is rampant and it is dangerous. We have at this point said enough."

Silver Falls on Dumping Fears

By The Associated Press

Fears that China will dump silver on the market sent silver
futures prices sharply lower in trading Wednesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.------------------

------------Silver prices plunged on a report in the semi-official Peoples Morning News that the Chinese
government will sell some of its silver reserves. The amount of silver to be sold was not mentioned. However, China is believed to have 93 million ounces of silver in reserve, according to analyst James Steel of Refco. Inc.

China is currently producing about 1,300 tons of silver annually, while consumption in that country is about 800 tons, making it plausible that a sale would take place, Steel said.--------------------------

Dear Sir, Thanks for your response.
--------You are advocating a global financial system predicated on the peaceful and mutually-beneficial "concubinage" of gold and the "new girl in town" fiat money the Euro which you unwarrantedly presume to be relatively more "chaste" than the Old Whore, the US dollar, ONLY
because it is not "backed" by as much debt as the dollar, and its "lovers" (the EU Central Bankers, the Rothschilds?; an assorted variety of Illuminati and various other power brokers playing both sides [the sheeple?] against the middle [more sheeple]) tip their hat at gold without solemnly
declaring their allegiance at sovereign money, PM etc. ------------------

No Mr. Frost;
I don't advocate that. I think this is your perception of future events. This transition will not be "peaceful" in any way. Any time one large official faction (Dollar/IMF group) has it's money power replaced by a new official faction (Euro / BIS), it's never peaceful and not without significant loss of wealth by some of the players. I add that both little and big players get hurt when these events happen. Usually, it's the little "uninformed" players that lose the most. Your observation that people are "sheeple" comes as they step in front of a train with no breaks. Then
you tell the world that "someone" is out to get them. My experience is that the average investor is much more intelligent than that and they can do a good job of "moving" off the tracks if it's pointed out to them that a train is coming.
The dollar is giving up it's reign as a reserve currency, not "only" because it has so much debt. It's being replaced because it's inflation (total money supply, dollar derivatives supply, dollar debt supply and the official liabilities foreign nations hold as reserves supply) has discounted so much future real US production, at a constant exchange rate, that it is losing the ability to function as a reserve currency. Every currency on earth has one day come to this end. We call it a "fiat money's timeline". At this point the users of this money begin to either "deflate it's supply" through debt and payment default, or the they devalue it by bidding up the value of real goods (price inflation). Once either of these begin, the money function of that reserve currency declines. Further, one will find
that deflation is only a choice is no other official world currency is available to run to. World citizens vote with their feet at this point and greatly discount unpayable debt thus causing said deflation. Inflation is the choice when people can "refinance" into another currency media. Leaving the old to contend with an ever increasing velocity of the useless money supply. This is the fate that waits the
dollar.
Is this some structure brought about by a New World Order? If you want to see it this way, then remember the world has been doing this from creation. I only add, why bother to put the "New" on it? Let's just call it "Next World Order"! Besides, it's only one peoples as a nation group (EURO / BIS) trying to protect their wealth because another nation group of peoples (Dollar / IMF) borrowed more that they could ever pay back! Still, I read this New World Order faction (NWOF) as loudly declaring the Euro as a fraud, yet they (NWOF) are hip deep the dollar assets of a country that "defaulted on it's gold delivery. Twice! Then they (NWOF) yell because no one is creating a new gold or gold backed currency. Why do that? So we can be defaulted again by the "NEXT World Order"?

This fiat money is necessary, you say, because it will allow management [manipuation] of the economy without suffering the deleterious side effects that a rigid gold standard has saddled us with in the past. Would you care to draw for the benefit of the forum the the philosophical line that
separates you from, say, an Alan Greenspan, as per the gold/fiat money relationship? do we not have TODAY a fully-floating POG alongside the dollar? What shall we gain in re-baptizing fiat money with a different name, i.e., the Euro? except the prolongation of the Game? IF gold IS
money than nothing else is. Disagree?
--------------------------

No PM;
We don't have a fully floating price of gold today. This is the illusion (paper gold) that has many people (such as yourself) locked into a narrow view. Mr. Greenspan has always seen the gold money relationship from a US dollar perspective and holding the US as the only dominating
financial power. He knows that the dollar could never retain it's position if gold became a "separate settlement currency" through a true world free physical market. All of the dollar price inflation that is currently locked into the present dollar supply inflation would present itself. Dollar reserves held world wide would become useless unless they could be used to buy real US goods (at a non inflated price).
Truly, Mr. G. only sees gold from a Washington view and even that must be locked in the cellar. He manages a system built by others and must use the tools this system allows. The present paper gold market is as much a function of the dollar value as interest rates and it is controlled as such.
Today, gold is money, I agree! But, it is not and never can be a fluctuating (in supply) digital money of high speed settlement. For it to work it's past magic in this modern world, it must trade in physical form without derivative use. It will.

Capitalism, this familiar but insidious term really stands for the willful confusion of a descripitive proposition [that private property exists] with a PRESCRIPTIVE one [that private property and the wealth that can be generated from it is GO(O)D]. -------------------

No PM, not at all.
This is the standard (higher level) teachings in modern Western education. History proves that "real private property" has and always has been both wealth and a purchasing power medium (money). Through the best of times and the worst of times, in war and peace, people have always had private property. Even in Russia of old, they had to allow people their things. Even if these positions weren't recorded "officially". A universal truth is that no form of
official ruler-ship can function unless people have some private wealth. Never has worked for even a short time and never will. Further, generating more wealth from private property (owned wealth) is only good if one can overcome the "RISK" that comes with it. This is nothing new to most of the world. It's just a different concept for modern Western man.

You write:
---------------
It's a logical fallacy that doesn't survive the glare of critical analysis. Omit the adjective "private" from the premise and what you end up with is the other side of the coin, or communism. Both systems are basically worship of materialism and humanistic (man is the measure of the universe) propaganda. Now, whereas communism theoretically aims at generating its "GOD", or 'goods and services' in economic parlance, via the sweat and toil of its fellow gods (the proletariat), capitalism is predicated on CONSTANT INSTABILITY [the insidious rhetoric of the bankers
notwithstanding] of the prices of these very goods and services, the [managed] fluctuations of which allow the people Greenspan works for to earn wealth they did not work for. -----------------

past gold standards will not force a "deflation effect". We will have our dollars and we will have them in good supply. To the end.
I (We) expect this to continue until the dollar is devalued thru a defaulted gold market (and soaring physical gold price) and further devalued from "settlement function" by the Euro. This is going to be an exciting time to witness. FOA

Reply to FOA - Possible Demands re Gold Breach of Contract
FOA,
I believe the recent demands made against Germany/Switzerland flowing from World War Two, and the end of gold convertability under Bretton Woods, are almost completely disanalogous;I don't see any demands ever arising against the US flowing from August 1971. The demands against Germany/Switzerland are heavily tied in with moral questions relating to Holocaust-type issues, and all that that entails. Whether rightly or wrongly, portions of world
opinion (particularly important groups in the US, and the broader world community) continue to view a continuing moral culpability on the part of Germany and Switzerland. On the other hand, the end of gold convertability was a pure commercial matter, somewhat akin to a bankruptcy, not
giving rise to important moral issues. -------------

No Mr. C;
A great many people were impacted along with their lifestyles. The dollar was devalued through price inflation during all of the remaining 70s and this directly lead to much of the stress in world affairs. Many smaller countries saw their citizens almost starve because of the changing cost of goods.
Further, important people only recognize a wrong as a "moral issue" when a public door is opened for "resolution" of that issue. Regular people must wait for justice untill the force of reality comes into play. Just as the demands made against Germany/Switzerland were buried for decades,
that didn't mean they were concluded, nor would this repudiate other precedent setting actions that occurred later in time.

You write:
------------
Remember, every other country ended gold convertability, and some of these countries did not disestablish the previously gold-backed currency - for example, Canada kept its dollar and Britain kept its pound, though gold-backing ended for these currencies. ------------

Indeed, these countries held dollars "as their gold" by international treaty. Just as a person has no more money after being robbed, dollar reserve countries after 71 were forced to use whatever money existed (they had no gold because the law said the dollar was a contract for it). People are not so shallow as to accept your "disestablish" reasoning. Watch someone in a store, given a choice of two, they will purchase what offers the best value. Only when one item is offered does the obvious become a naive selection.
Canada and Britain did not later back their currencies with gold, did they. Nor will the US!

Your words:
---------------
Also, neither Germany nor Switzerland expressly stated - "no more claims will be recognized flowing from World War II". However, the US has expressly extinguished any demands
for gold against the Treasury, except for some very old issues of certificates and dollars. Thus, the US has made an express policy decision that no demands are to be made against its gold. This has not stopped the rest of the world from continuing to view the dollar as the pre-eminent currency.

Mr. C,
If the US expressly stated as policy that the sun will not rise are we to accept it? Again, a world pre-eminent currency is one accepted from a background of "choice". No other currency was presented for use in a major settlement function capacity. Today the Euro has.

I offer Journeyman's post (thanks Journeyman)as a further argument:

Journeyman (1/2/00; 23:41:12MDT - Msg ID:22095)
Stealing is not immoral? @canimami
The stealing of the gold from "foreigners" in 1971 by the US Gvt. in cahoots with the Federal Reserve by refusing to redeem redeemable notes, specifically redeemable in gold and as specified in the US Constitution was the SECOND biggest robbery in the history of the world. The FIRST biggest heist was pulled off by the FED & USA Corp. in 1933 when the same perps, this time headed by Franklin Delano Rosevelt, similarly stole the gold from its own citizens.
The question is, I guess, since these two events are the two biggest thefts in history, is "Is stealing immoral?" Well is it? Or do you excuse those organizations calling themselves "government," no matter what they do? Or is only when YOU are the beneficiary that anything goes? Regards,
Journeyman

Further from your post:
---------------------
The bottom line: the US will not entertain any claims against its gold on either a moral or legal basis, and I don't believe any claims will be made against it either. This matter has been resolved, and the US would disregard any attempts to make this an issue, though I doubt such attempts would even be made.------------------

Sir, you have spoken a very clear "Western viewpoint". Truly, it does look different from other directions.

----"We are of the opinion that the Money he and the Fed have been creating in the past two months (going on $200 billion...an awesome amount ) reflects his efforts to avert a crisis situation that is being kept hush-hush."--------

Michael,
They may take some of this back, but only a small bit of it. All one has to do is follow ORO's posts to get a feel for what is happening. (ORO, I'm getting to your good stuff!) The dollar is being challenged by the Euro in a very big way. And it's happening even faster than expected. I think several other measures were available to the BIS if the transition had not already begun. It's possible that the dollar will come under massive pressure this year if we continue this way. The Fed has no choice but to cover the liquidity drain. Eventually, this will break the paper gold pricing grip on the physical metal. Truly, the ECB is letting the dollar system rip wide open from it's own hand.

Steve H- "Good one #22209!"
ORO- Great posts today--Thank You!!
FOA, I have researched the above URL "BIS" site, and my conclusion is, the BIS only conducts business with Central Banks. So, in the recent Dutch sale of Gold, and future Gold buying by the BIS, ALL that Gold would stay withen the Central Banking System, and have NO effect on world
"normal consumption" of Gold.----------------------

Actually Beesting, you hit the nail right on the head. The BIS is the only entity in the world that the dollar/IMF (and LBMA) worry about. That is because they can move gold between CBs at any value they want and do so without any supply passing through the paper markets first.
As this sinks into the minds of paper players, they will realize just how inflated the contract market is in relation to what physical gold is available to it. Remember, Euroland backed away from the dollar gold price illusion early last year. They would have stepped in and brought physical
to support the price. Instead they stood back and let it drop down to the $250 range, as they must have had the "Washington Agreement" in the works.
It no longer became a question of price, rather a question of when? I think it was because the Euro started out "too strong" in the beginning. They needed market acceptance and usage first, then begin the process of marking dollars to the gold price. I am expecting this year to produce some concrete moves in this direction.

You write:
-----------
FOA, do you agree with that analysis? Or, do you think the BIS could enter the world Gold market, replace the LBMA, and buy and sell non-paper Gold only? In My Opinion it would be a large European Bank that would first compete with the LBMA, and then after a collapse of paper Gold, join forces with The LBMA, sometime in the future. Your thoughts and opinions are always greatly appriciated ....beesting.-------------------

I think the ECB will eventually sanction a physical gold market in Europe that trades and settles only in Euros. The LBMA will eventually fall completely out of the picture as their product comes into question.

Reply to FOA - #22544
FOA, for ease of reference, I will repost a reply I made to Journeyman, then I will add a few brief comments. First, here is the repost:

Of course stealing is immoral, and it would have been preferable for the US to comply with Bretton Woods, or to withdraw while it was still able to meet extant obligations, so there would not figuratively have been a "breach of contract".

That being said, we are dealing with the actions of sovereign states, which are indeed immune from the ordinary principles of contract law, including the principles of private international law as they relate to contracts. My post related to the assertions of FOA, that the US would face demands for the honouring of gold backing just as the Swiss and Germans faced demands relating to Holocaust-related matters, years after the fact. I countered that the two matters are too dissimilar for there to be a valid analogy - i.e., like comparing apples and oranges.
-----------------------------

Mr. C.,
I ask, were not the Swiss and Germans also sovereign states? Were their actions allowed as related to international law? In addition, I'm not trying to draw an analogy as you perceive it. The precedent was that the dollar was a certificate for gold in storage, not a debt owed to someone else. The closing of the gold window in 71 was a "taking of physical property" in much the same
light as "taking someone's private property". I make this point not because the BIS "is" about to ask for gold, rather that the US will never again back the current US dollar with it's gold. They must create another currency medium first.

You state:
--------------
However, if obligations relating to 1971 are to be dug up, then the US is free to dig up the defaults of countries after WW1. Back then, basically all currencies were completely gold-backed. In the course of WW1, the major countries became indebted to the US. Except for Finland, all the Europeans defaulted on their official debt to the US. So, if some countries can dig up ancient breaches of contract like 1971 (at law, an ancient issue, and I would also say a breach that has already been waived even on a moral level), then the US can dig up the WW1 breaches of contract by European countries - with accumulated interest. Also, such demands for compensation are made against Ger/Swit because Germany/Switzerland are willing to listen to such demands. On the other hand, the Japanese have ignored demands to compensate Hong Kong veterans and others
who were tortured, and to compensate the victims of the Rape of Nanking. Thus, few demands are even directed at Japan. This is how sovereign states generally operate. Given that most of the putative complainers concerning 1971 have "shafted" the US in the past, I doubt any demands for the honouring of the Bretton Woods gold backing will be made.
----------------

Again, the closing of the gold window was not a debt issue. None of your above items are relevant. The US seized gold belonging to others by not shipping what was in vault storage.

You say:

------------
Thus, FOA, I disagree with your assertion that the US will ever face demands relating to the 1971 closing of the gold window. Subsequent to closing the gold window, the world agreed for a time to currencies directly pegged to the US dollar, and then that arrangement ended. ----------------
----------------------------------

My friend, the dollar reserves held in foreign banks were not these "pegged" holdings you speak of. Foreign moneys pegged through exchange rates to dollars is one thing. However, there were real dollars held as gold certificate reserves by these Central Banks. There was no arrangement on this issue. The US took their gold plain and simple.

Your words:
------------------
However, the fact that the rest of the world adopted the US dollar as the baseline currency after the closing of the gold window suggests that most of humanity did not view that a great injustice had taken place by the closing of that window; in fact, that closing was seen coming for years prior to 1971.
---------------------

In the same light, was the inaction on Swiss and German issue a sign of acceptance? Apparently not!

Onward:
------------
Remember, the US did not seek out the role as reserve currency to the world after WWII, it agreed to accept that role only after pleadings from other countries. Moreover, any country that distrusted US dollars could have demanded gold instead. ---------------

My point exactly. The very fact that the US shipped so much gold prior to closing sets the precedent that the dollar was a gold certificate, not a debt or IOU. It was payable on demand for many years.

Further in your thoughts:
------------------------
It is fanciful to believe that demands concerning 1971 will be made now against the US, and even more fanciful to believe that anyone would take such demands seriously. To use legal language, the limitations period has passed, and in any event the breach was waived. Further, a history's worth of demands could then be reopened. The US could demand repayment of WWI-era debts, with interest. It could demand reparations from Germany and Japan for WWII, against the Arabs for oil supply contracts broken during the Oil Embargo - it would never end. This is a can of worms the world will leave closed.
-----------------

I submit that it is "fanciful indeed" for one to think that the pre 71 dollar was a debt of gold. Clearly, all the evidence says it was not. The dollar represented gold held on deposit for any Central bank that requested it. Because most foreign citizens could own gold in their countries (US
citizens could not), they were free to ask for gold from their local banks in return for dollars. Thus, the US having taken the gold would become a private action if they ever backed the same dollar again Will this is a can of worms stay closed? Absolutely! The dollar will never be backed with deliverable gold again! Believe it!

The trades involve a lender, a borrower, a bullion bank, and a physical buyer.
--The bank is both long and short gold denominated or gold indexed obligations. This is a complex multiple contract position. More on this later.
--The borrower is short "physical" which is due for delivery. This is a contract obligation. Gold miners and bank trading desks, as well as speculators hold these positions.
--The lender is long gold denominated obligations. This is a contract position. The contract is as good as the counterparty. If you own a gold account, or are long a derivative contract, this is what you have.
--The cash buyer holds gold bullion and is obligated to nobody. His holdings do not rely on anyone fulfilling an obligation.

The leverage built into the market, which we goldbugs will benefit from in the long run, is that of the many obligations denominated in gold. We need not buy leveraged instruments, because the leverage comes from the extreme volume of gold obligations issued within the "paper gold" trading arena described above. The same elements that make gold an attractive investment at this time and a long term store of value (over a lifetime), particularly during banking crises, make the various forms of leveraged gold unattractive. One should note the point of gold being protection from an environment of default on obligations. The same obligations that gold derivatives are.
-------------------------------------------------------

ORO,
Your presentation has described the leverage issue very well. This is the very essence of a gold run that manifests itself in the overflow "spilling out" from the paper arena into the much, much smaller physical arena. I doubt that very much paper gold will be forced into delivery before the
entire market stops contract trading. Still, some have said that official guarantees, insurance companies and the large financial reserves of players will be brought to play in making this market whole. In reality this is true. But further into reality, the more the resources become available to "cash out this arena" with gold delivery, the further away the physical gold price will run. The point
always was that no amount of contract supporting dollars could ever balance the gold owed. The more they try, the higher the price gets.
They could let it run, but at what price does it fully settle? $1000, 5000, 10000 ???? I have no doubts that it will be closed long before important people are killed (financially) in this. Further, before this comes to a head the total outstanding gold derivatives could double or triple in supply (building from the US side alone). All completely unbacked and issued in a effort to drive the paper price lower. We only know that in the maelstrom, just before the close, the paper leverage against each ounce could be unthinkable. This could impact your thinking in ORO #22236. We can discuss tomorrow.
I have but to add that there is another leverage issue that will take over once this one is resolved in a physical market trading at a much higher price. This later item is the leverage of a "true world-wide gold demand" in the format of gold being a settlement asset. It's effects on a limited supply, both mine and open market, would be incredible. Again, few of us understand how money gold would interact with the modern wealth of today. In no way has the world gold stocks increased in any form of proportion to the productive capacity we now know. Again, this view is taken across the valley where the dollar was butchered.

Further you write:

-------------
The most important aspect of gold as financial disaster insurance is that it is immune from default. The second point, particularly important for the gold mining investor, is that in financial crissis, desperate governments are prone to disregard the property rights of large holders of industrial assets. The most captive form of industrial asset are the mine and the oil well. The most attractive asset for taxation and expropriation in time of crissis is a gold mine. Very large hoards of precious metals may prove attractive to a government seeking survival. The small hoards remaining in the West are not attractive targets.
-------------------------------

Yes, sir. This seems as impossible as the question of the BIS going after gold rebacking the dollar. But, this is the way the world works and the dollar timeline is running out of it's future. The trick now is in getting some of your assets out of harms way, well before the fact. The problem is in the dreams of every gold mine owner; the spiking of gold! The next gold run will be caused from pressures far different in dynamics from price inflation. Indeed, it may rum so fast. so quick that every country closes it's borders to gold flow. Usually this is accompanied with foreign exchange controls. (Ever notice how gold is always included in these currency flows controls? Not silver, platinum, copper or oil. Just gold.). The next event would be an emergency 60% (or something to this effect) exchange rate tax on bullion that comes out of ore sellers pockets. Then, it's later made permanent in some form of "windfall profits tax" against the companies. Oh yes, the mines stay in
operation and the ore is milled, it's just that the costs (price inflation) and taxes do a number on the stockholders equety. This may not happen in every country. But that's another story.

Your words:
----------------------
The use of gold futures and options in the battle for financial self preservation during a financial crissis is equivalent to a knight charging at his enemy with a shaking kielbasa. Gold mining shares are similar to waving one's title to the land in face of the Mongol horde's charge. Wouldn't it be rather smart to hold a sword on top of the ramparts of a castle? Taking our little Midieval setting further, one does not complain of the building of the castle, though long after its construction came no attack. The expense of time and effort, of missed opportunities
and reduced performance will come to be appreciated when disaster strikes.

Ha, Ha! ORO, I sent your "waving one's title to the land in face of the Mongol horde's charge" to someone and they loved it! What better way to put it. Just great.

Comment
Saturday, January 08, 2000
BOSTON (Reuters) - The United States has not sold any of its gold reserves and has no plans to do so, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Saturday. "I categorically deny assertions that U.S. gold reserves were being sold off or that there is any plan to sell them off," Summers told reporters on the sidelines of an economics conference.
His denial came amid talk in the gold markets that some of the weakness in the gold price over recent years may have been caused by direct U.S. sales of gold. ---------------

ALL:
I posted once before that the US was not selling it's gold. Again, I completely agree with Mr. Summers statement and submit that it is a spoken truth in full context to the question.
Many reach for this easy reason (official gold sales) for our current low gold price. The reason this comes about is that without using this line of reasoning, one has to accept that: 1. the current gold price is mostly a paper contract fabrication 2. it's easily controlled as long as the "current price setting system" is functioning 3. this gold price everyone uses, could fall through the floor if the contract system comes into question 4. physical gold (dealers) prices could skyrocket in the future as no one accepts the credibility of any contract for derivative gold. Effectively destroying the paper equity of gold banking.
Most of the people in the gold industry do not want to hear this. For them, a break-up of the London gold market would destroy their financial partners and spike the physical gold price into uncontrolled levels. Most of the industry designed their business plan to embrace a "common
viewpoint" on gold. They expect, want and look for a return of a gold price that is in the range of $300 to $600. Something the paper marketplace can live with and their financing structure can survive "profitably". Above $600 and even ABX must post margin!
For one to embrace the knowledge that the "Washington Agreement" is real and that the other major nations are not selling into the market; we also must accept how the reverse leverage on physical gold will someday wipe out the entire dollar / gold marketplace. Clearly, this would imply the obvious, physical gold has more leverage than any of it's paper derivatives (gold stocks included). Truly, if you are selling a paper product, your income (and most likely your private investment position) depends on your finding another answer to the low gold price problem!
The sales of official CB gold must be the answer for many. We have for several years (longer than that privately) been discussing this gold market resolution and it's meaning to private physical gold advocates. Our position is that this is a long term evolution of the dollar reserve system. A system that was extended in life for a politically "fixed"
term by changing the very nature of the gold market. Further; Only recently (the last few years) has the timeline of the dollar begun it's final turndown from international "settlement use". Today, the signs are becoming increasingly clear that the Euro (for better or worse) is indeed breaking the grip of dollar financing and use. We expect this to continue and intensify it's effects on the very existence
of a dollar gold arena. As such, we now live in a period we call "the time for super gold". Perhaps our year 2000 marke the beginning od that change.
Prior to this, the accumulation of physical gold could only be viewed as a "long term , extremely secure saving account". One that would contain all the past investment gains an improving economy could produce. And represent those value gains in a future "money settlement roll" that only a free gold trading market would produce. Many have forgone the current financial craze with the complete security that the historical record of gold will not be broken. Truly, gold will later represent a buying power that makes current paper gains seem small!
We do not present this as an investment in the usual sense. Rather one should buy gold as the real wealth it has always been. No different that your car, house, etc. are real money wealth also. Only today, gold wealth does not reflect it's true dollar price value because the paper marketplace does not reflect the trading of real physical gold. Indeed, a clear advantage for persons that can step out from their "Western world" reasoning.

Onward:

Hello ORO,
Yesterday in my (FOA (01/08/00; 23:38:28MDT - Msg ID:22560), I mentioned how ""before this comes to a head the total outstanding gold derivatives could double or triple in supply"".
This is an extremely possible event that is in no way different from our current mania in US stocks. The final act out of a money supply inflation is always reflected in the trading of the "popular wealth" of that era. Weather it is "real things wealth" as seen in the past (price inflation) or our current "Western" fascination with "contract paper wealth", fiat money leverage always explodes right at the end. With the paper gold markets holding a base trading level around 1,000 tonnes a day, any rush of events could easily gun the creation of gold contracts into a much higher
level. And therefore increase the leverage for physical gold "after the fact".

ORO (1/4/00; 8:16:45MDT - Msg ID:22236)
A (bullion) BANK NOTE
A note about the implication of the banker's situation: through the banker's borrowing and lending, all modern bullion owned outright has an equivalent part, nearly three times larger, of paper gold. The bankers have formed a 60,000-80,000 ton gold banking system using 20,000 tons of gold, most of which is now held by "cash" holders.

Common estimates of private gold bullion holdings available to the financial markets, most notably the one produced for the Fed in 1997 (estimated for 1995), put the gold at 20,000 tons. I have reason to believe that there are 10,000 tons more, bringing the total to some 30,000. I will not go
into the iffy details of the estimate, but note that one of the major components is "Yamashita's treasure", which has been in the gold markets since 1984, some of it even before that date. Whenever stories come up about the reappearance of that hoard to act as an overhang on the markets, you can rest assured that it has already been introduced to them in its entirety. These 10,000 tons are in "semi-official" hands of Royals of the Oil countries, the Vatican. Much of the
rest of the remainder (once the gold jewelry deficit is accounted for) sits in Rothchild vaults, and a few other large holders, "giants" much as described by FOA and ANOTHER.
------------------------------------------------

ORO,
I have no doubt that these figures are in line with reality. In fact, they are losing their relevance as the insanity continues. Most people only look at the "writers" (short) obligation to make good on the deal. Yet, few consider the implication that a market "shut down" would create. Literally, both sides of the deal would be looking for "GOLD". The short, of course! But, in addition, he may be drawn to buy his own position in physical and walk from further adding any "deal equity". In addition, the "long" would observe the obvious inability of the market to deliver and undertake a physical purchase outside his deal.
The point is that during a melt down, the entire human infrastructure of a paper market would be looking to buy. In other words, the gross total of world open interest times two (X2) running for gold. It does rather overload the little CB holdings, doesn't it?

You write:
--------------------
The volumes of gold paper traded by the LBMA become much clearer when taken in context of the gold banking system rather than in context of annual gold production. The 1000 tons traded daily are well proportioned to the normal trading patterns in currencies. Eurodollar interest
derivatives constitute about 5.5 $T traded on New York exchanges, and another 55 $t or so are traded OTC with 62% netting (figures are from memory so don't shoot me if I'm off a little) bringing it to 19 $t. This is equivalent to the estimated 21 $t in Eurodollar debt outstanding (my estimate). This comes to 7%to 7.5% of outstanding positions traded daily. Applying this proportion to the gold market's 1000 tons, one comes to 14,000 tons of net debt - the same kind of debt as Eurodollar debt. This is debt generated by the sale of physical gold in the four part transactions.
------------------------------

Sir ORO,
Prior to LBMA giving open figures, the trading was quite high. Even if one had no inside view of their arena, the fact that our 1,000 tonne figure didn't just arrive "overnight" should point to a long term trading build-up. We can be sure that from at least 1990 onward, the paper gold system was backing the dollar on a planned schedule of events.

You offer more:
----------------------
While the physical supply actually went into hoards of all sorts, the paper remained circulating in the markets. The gold accounts now stand at an incredible level of over 40,000 tons by my reckoning. Nearly 30,000 tons are owed by bullion bankers directly - without counter obligations
denominated in kind. They have only 4,800 tons in credible gold mining company obligations, and another 9,000 tons were borrowed by speculative funds playing the carry trade. The remaining reserves, some 10,000 tons, can not be used to pay off the gold denominated debt because the reserves are mostly borrowed and must be kept on hand to cover obligations to Oil Royals (the major lenders of these reserves). Of the other 20,000 tons in private gold hoards, only 6,000 remain in private hands outside of the Bullion banking system. 14,000 were supplied to the market over the years, and hang around the necks and in the noses and from ears of a billion people. The total commitments of bullion banks (including derivatives) are most probably around 60,000 tons, with an imbalance of some 35,000 tons, where gold was "borrowed" by the bankers (in reality only
dollars arrived at the bank for most of this, and the bank issued a gold denominated obligation),and the lending by the bankers was in dollars.
Their remaining gold denominated assets:
- Gold reserves are 10,000 tons, (I hope)
- mining company obligations are at 5,000 tons,
- Speculative fund obligations are 10,000 tons.
The remaining counters to the bullion banker's gold obligations are denominated in currency.
Physical gold lent TO bullion banks, about 25,000 tons.
Physical gold lent BY bullion banks, about 15,000 tons.
-------------------------------

Again, I agree, but ask the question "are these commitments becoming irrelevant in gold terms"? This is "gold banking" on a pure fractional reserve basis and very much reflects the dollar prior to 71. Years ago, we hit a point where the market place is just trading the price of gold, not gold itself. They have created a form of "gold currency" that is more a "gold price obligation" rather than
"gold supply situation". It simply could not function once real delivery was asked for. This is the corner the ECB / BIS have pushed the dollar into. Force a change in the need for "contract gold banking" and you break the credibility of the market. Break that credibility and the dollar is
exposed in a gold price move.
Here, we can get a sense of the massive effects a change in the use of the dollar would have on these liabilities. Once the dollar begins it's slide from trade settlement (happening now), a dollar gold currency is not needed. Any break in the gold banking market would render a "new price" for physical gold. That price would begin to reflect the past dollar money supply inflation.

An Overview
ORO (01/06/00; 15:05:40MDT - Msg ID:22411)
Your words:
-----------------
For years, I could not understand how the dollar could stabilize in 1980. It was a complete mystery to me. Austrian monetary theory, which I studied with the intense interest of youth, alongside Monetarist theory, was giving no clue as to how the dollar could be stable at all once the arbitrage
to gold through redeemability was closed to everyone - CBs included. ---------------------

ORO,
It was amazing wasn't it? During that time, anyone that had any grasp of money theory just knew that eventual world wide dollar inflation was coming. Yet, right after the Mexico default crisis, the whole system came back to life. Never before in history had a country dropped it's gold backing, watched it's currency be devalued against gold ($800+) and then returned it to normal use as if nothing had happened.
But something did happen and it sent the world onto a different trail. Thinkers, world leaders, common workers, and investors had just spent the previous ten years learning the true worth of oil! And they learned how it had two values.

Consider:

Duality of value is a funny thing.
If you have a gun in hand pointed at me and I have an identical gun pointed at you, their (the guns) worth is the same. Yet, if I am wearing a bullet-proof vest, my identical gun has more worth. Not much, just a little more. Strategic location?
You pointed out how in 1933 dollars outside the US were worth their weight in gold. Yet, inside the US they were not. The same dollar had a dual value dependent on location.
Oil, gold, minerals and ones bank account can all have dual values based on the strategic location of these items.
Another form of duality exists for most things. Gold has a jewellery value and a monetary value. It's price is reflected in the degree of total demand generated from each value. In fact everything we own has our personal wealth value and a "monetary" worth.
After 1980, oil also reflected this different duality.

Back to the main trail:

In the late 60s and early 70s some US strategic leaders were beginning to understand the "monetary value" of oil. It was becoming clear that local oil reserves, not gold was the real backing behind the robust US economic engine. Like gold today, oil back then was worth a whole lot more than the amount we were paying for it.
The simple fact was that as long as your economic system got more from (out of) the local oil it brought than printing ones currency took away, local oil was worth more as a "monetary backing" than gold. This was the changing currency climate some could see long ago. Modern society, as it functioned using digital settlement was restructuring monetary theory. The only problem was that it wasn't changing the importance of "human nature" or "strategic location".

By the early 70s the old gold exchange standard was breaking down, even as the worlds goods production system was just embarking on a new era of efficiency. Using the benefits of hindsight, we can today see that each year into the 70s, 80s and 90s all brought technological gains that were overshadowed by our currency system's flaws. The world was using technology to get more out of the life's blood in a modern economy, oil.
It was recognized that even though the old (gold) money system of the 60s had priced oil favourably for the US, it's (US) oil reserves were running out at that price. We needed a higher price for oil in order to build local reserves. At the very least, we needed higher prices to discover higher cost reserves located in the "Strategic Americas" (both north and south).
The potential (indeed, it was reality at that time) for the Middle East to continue producing reasonably priced oil for gold (dollars) stood in the way these needed higher prices. In order to resolve this, we moved off the gold standard (1971) and onto the oil standard. Again, in hindsight it was a masterful play. You see, in duality, oil in the Middle east was worth more than other oil if it
could back the dollar in world settlement.

Make no mistake, gold was and still is the center of the money universe. Only the way we utilized it was changed (indeed, it's about to be changed again). ORO, the US had already placed it's currency on an oil standard years before (in practical theory anyway). They were expanding the
money supply directly in relation with the increased production of goods that modern oil use was providing. Of course they ran away with the process as is always the case. Gunning the debt money supply and justifying it by extrapolating growth at ever increasing rates. Dollar creation overran the ability of the gold exchange standard to balance it. Still, in all fairness, the old system was built on a much slower creation of production efficiencies and couldn't accommodate this modern surge of wealth (and debt). Let's face it, the world has no precedent for the last 30 years of growth. By adhering to the fixed money supply, currencies would have risen in value creating a deflationary effect on the debt created from this growth. Our first experiment with this came as the US decided
to keep gold in the money universe but back the currency with oil. Better said: "continue to settle oil in dollars as long as the rate (oil price) creates more value from production than the inflation of the currency takes away".
This is the reason the BIS did not lobby the US to officially devalue the dollar in gold (raise the dollar gold rate from $42 to say $200) and continue the system. Even though many people were hurt from this, the system was failing and had to change. The tactic was not to stop using dollars if the gold was not delivered, but rather for the US to just stop shipping the gold. In reality the dollar is still a receipt for $42 in gold, but the it will never be connected to gold again. Ever!
In the background, the value of the gold backing lost was found in oil. In reality, the value of oil to the world economy was increasing much faster than value of gold lost from dollar default. Even at the higher prices per barrel the need and demand for oil proved to be a far superior "monetary backing" for the dollar than gold. As long as the majority of oil producers agreed to receive dollars
for oil, the stage was set for a renewed surge in growth the world over.
Yet, gold was still in the monetary game. Only this time the game was proving to be short lived and unstable. This new "free market" for gold was soon being leveraged in a way the old dollar was. Once again, the supply of gold contracts was exploding as they were responding to the new demands of an expanding world economic system. Only this time it wasn't the dollar that was about to default, it was the "new gold market".
Today, we find ourselves on the edge of yet another change in the world financial structure.

More Overview
Working from my FOA (01/10/00; 20:39:02MDT - Msg ID:22663)
An Overview:

" " Our first experiment with this came as the US decided to keep gold in the money universe but back the currency with oil. Better said: "continue to settle oil in dollars as long as the rate (oil price) creates more value from production than the inflation of the currency takes away".--------

Initially this created instability in the financial system. Through out the 70s players ran into gold, trying to regain the monetary security the dollar had lost without it. Soon, everyone realized that no amount of conversion would ever replace all the foreign dollars outstanding. The dollars stayed in circulation even as they were traded for gold. Further, the dollars were still being received by ME
oil producers in return for oil. Dollar price inflation was bad, but in no means did we see the "runaway price inflation" that should have come from a reserve currency without gold backing.

In practical theory, oil now backed the dollar as world oil payments were settled in dollars. In return, gold now backed oil from a US guarantee of an open market for the metal. Over time, a portion of oil dollars could be replaced with real gold through actual physical purchases or in
participation with evolving world gold banking (paper gold). Even though the dollar gold price had surged, the higher oil prices were allowing a percentage of those dollars to be converted back into gold at the old gold/oil rate. Slowly, the old dollar holdings (prior to 71) were effectively being used to reclaim gold. The expansion of the world dollar money supply was seen as reflecting the more modern importance (value) of oil in the economy. As long as growth in the production of economic goods outstripped dollar price inflation, the dollar could be expanded to match the unrealized value held in oil.

Again, "strategic location" of the worlds major oil reserves was the backbone behind this "duality" in oils value. Gold in fort knox could not back the dollar anymore, because the US had shown that they could just withdraw it from backing. In fact, the entire validity of backing any
currency with a fixed gold amount was in question with this new age of "super nation blocks". For it to work again, gold and the reserve currency backed by it would have to reside in different "power blocks" to guarantee delivery. That wasn't going to happen. Indeed, with supply of the worlds
major oil reserves being controlled outside the US, the dollar was now backed more effectively by a commodity that could be used to devalue it (through the oil price) should the money supply run wild.

This system balanced, as the value received from oil by the goods producing world outran the loss from price inflation initially created from rising oil prices. ORO, this does not explain everything , by any means. But, it does at least give us a handle on the dollar transition through out the 70s and 80s. Looking back one can see that "money theory" wasn't thrown out the window, only reworked
a great deal. It offers a reasonable understanding as to why the dollar continued, even as the US treasury took control of the world financial system.

Today, the situation is changing in a much more dramatic way. I'll later offer a view as to where we are and where we are going.

What a mess! Cavan Man, (I know you are still reading) I used your Thoughts as a measurement of what I was doing. This is a "very" large group to walk with, as such we often only hear the nearby discussion, yet many are along for this walk and choose not to talk. So, I find myself walking in the middle, the front and the rear, in a effort to not only be close and hear the talk but to "see" the map they read. In life, I have seen how often "the more verbal ones" project the direction of the quiet groups and I take this in. Cavan Man, you did not change my will to hike, rather your post made me "think out loud".
There is no leading or following here, as we are all on this journey whether one acknowledges it or not. I am only a small part of the group. It's just much more interesting is we can see the real "natural wonders" on the right, left, behind and in front, instead of just the next step before our aching feet. Yet, I understand how some would rather see the trail as only a series of completed single steps. Each with definable distance, impression and easy to collaborate. Ha! Ha! Indeed, it may be more of an American Journey if one can "float on the surface of a river" within easy view
and "earshot" of those walking the hard trail! (smile)

ORO,
Thanks for your "some comments" posts 1, 2, 3,. I have only read them quickly and am pressed for time. Will reply (rebuttal / agreement (smile)) to these excellent thoughts before I post my next "overview". In the mean time something to consider; by the late 60s, dollars were not "arbitraged"
into gold with the effect that "hard monetary theory" had envisioned . It was becoming more of a "concept" as the money supply continued to grow much faster than gold was shipped out of the country. This "soft" link to gold was growing as dollar production was being fuelled by the oil
perception. Officials brought into the concept that for much of our natural future, oil would always make "things" cheaper, faster and in greater supply. As such no amount of future debt and the money supply growth that followed it, was too much! This process of making the evolution of "oil
productivity backing" a more real backing than gold.

Today's Gold Report: Swiss Lean Toward Liquidation through BIS

Hello Michael,
The background of this Swiss statement is more exciting than the announcement! We have offered for some time that future "official" Euroland sales would evolve into ECMBs (European Member Central Bank) buying gold "off market" and out of the reach of the LBMA . First the Dutch and now the Swiss have begun to open the door to this. The full 2,000 tonnes of gold covered in the Washington Agreement may not come to be used as collateral behind current gold paper. Truly, they (ECB/BIS) are cutting them off and starving the market. The next step will be the revelation that the "transfers" are occurring at higher dollar prices (and probably lower Euro prices, if they are done in that currency) than the spot market. Behind the stage, we have been "on the road" to higher physical prices ever sense the "agreement" was announced. The BIS has always had the power to break the Bullion Bank's from market controll by changing it from contract form into physical. Our current price doldrums do not indicate the frantic nature of life in this new "fast lane". Most traders are watching the paper markets and feel they are "dead in the water". This perception will change in the next act of paper destruction. We have had act #1 and each ensuing one should be more severe. Lease rates rise, paper prices gun up, major loses then a load of more
gold contracts dumped to force the price down. I bet they have run out of small lenders after the last run around. If so, (maybe the next go around) the contract discounting begins?

How much wisdom in our anals of history; how much deliberate choice?
ORO,
On the whole, this output is your best yet in both clarity of thought and presentation. Kudos. A distinct pleasure to read.

But, (there's always a "but" isn't there?) the sheer size and comprehensive scope of the material, defies any reasonable means for me (if I were to be so bold) to provide some of the feedback you are seeking. The ability to apply digital "post-it" notes to your on-line text would be required--to rave at the many flashes of brilliance, and to suggest possible course-corrections or avenues for further thought and discussion.

Taken as a whole then, you are possibly making one mistake in your inferences/conclusions regarding the official decision-making process that rests behind the scenes now in monetary history. You are possibly giving the officials of the day too much credit. With your 20/20 hindsight you are able to see the events of the day with the benefit of a perspective they did not share. You do a marvelous job of making the several important arguments from the several sides of the issues, but in truth, these guys were often flying by the seat of their pants, reacting as necessary to bail enough water to keep the boat afloat. It would seem that even when considering the conference of Bretton Woods in 1944, (and the IMF revamping summit in Jamaica in 1976,) the world has not seen such a concerted, thorough, and intelligent thought given to monetary matters as your suggestions would imply until the era of Maastricht arrived.

To wit, the dollar wasn't backed with oil because it was carefully calculated to be the most superior form of monetary arrangement. You have had little trouble poking at the flaws of such a scheme. In the eyes of the officials involved at the time, what was done was perhaps the most expedient course of "policy," for the day, and the concept of oil "backing" the dollar by any fair assessment is most probably a de facto result of the path of least political resistance coupled with our perceptive advantage of hindsight. Meaning, at the time, it was not expressly determined that oil would replace Gold in a new form of "commodity standard," but effectively, hindsight reveals that's effectively what we got -- the approximate result of evolving policy and trade agreements that maintained dollars as the currency of oil settlement (even after the Bretton Woods notion of Gold for $35 went beyond a blushing fiction to unabashed fantasy--followed by the reality of nothing when the window closed in 1971.) Even in those following days, many significant players expected this condition to be temporary--with Gold to be refitted to the monetary framework under some new form of workable terms. (Or should I say, they expected the monetary framework to be refitted to accomodate meaningful Gold settlement--we all know that only Gold is "money" in this modern world.)

To reiterate, I'm not calling into question the quality of your analysis and arguments, but rather, that you have given credit (of dubious quality, to be sure) to the policy makers where none was due. You've assumed a "Method" where, in fact, there was only "Madness."

Final food for thought: policy is set by politicians (not by intellectuals), and the quality of those so employed has not changed much between then and now. (At least by giving them too much credit you've avoided the other popular fallacy of assuming them to be hopeless and complete idiots. *grin*) But had the likes of an ORO or Antal Fekete been given full latitude in shaping the policy of that day, there is little doubt in my mind that we would all be better off today. But as it is, we are only now after 30 years repairing the financial architecture with the euro, bringing Gold back out of the shadows.

And as always, being a mere child in the world, I reserve the right to be spectacularly wrong in my perception of these issues. After you consider how much rationalization is appropriate for painting our history as a deliberate and calculated act, you are free to carry on.

Gold. Get you some. ---Aristotle

ALL:
A few quick words then I'll post a reply to ORO with my next overview (perhaps an hour?).

Ha! Ha!, light sweet crude over $28! Now there is a fact one can chew on, right Permafrost! Tell me , everyone, what good were the "facts" from the beginning of 98 -1999, when they were used to point people to COMING $5.00 OIL! Not much, right?
Speaking of facts; In Barrons today they did an article on the Euro. I think they said "the Euro is the next biggest thing to impact us on a level equal to the internet" (or something like that). The major thrust of the write-up was to point out how the Euro had overtaken the dollar in international bond issuance. What a "blow out" in the first year of existence!
Can anyone remember all the negative "facts" being promoted regarding the Euro in 1998 and the beginning of 1999. All kinds of official statistics were used to indicate how it would never be born, never be used at any level equal to the dollar. In "FACT" every possible shred of evidence
was paraded about to show how the Euro would die, soon after it's beginning.
People, the point I'm making here (and to Permafrost) is that facts don't tell us what's going to happen, they tell you "What Happened"! Further, it's the motivations and political intentions of international leaders that shape the real world we live in. When these "minds with power" decide on a direction, the reactions in the marketplace then create the facts we all need to see. After the policy changes were made!
On this forum, you often read what is being promoted, what is being thought and what direction this may take in the real world. We look for "Events" to produce the "Facts" that pertain to these posts. Many of our loudest critic proclaim that our Thoughts are "dishonest" because no "facts" are available to collaborate out projections. Well, if their understandings, perceptions and connections to and about how leaders make "private policy" limits their (the critics) ability to look forward??? Truly, this is a curable disease, that's best defeated by reading USAGOLD FORUM 2nd and asking for Michael's News and Views 1st. (smile)
Finally, I add, we walk this trail looking forward "first". Before the left, right and back is observed.

Some discussion for ORO beginning with:

ORO (1/12/00; 10:01:35MDT - Msg ID:22773)
FOA - some comments - Part I

You write:------------------------I am trying to put the two issues in perspective, (1) the break in the gold backing and (2) the need to price oil at a higher dollar price for the dual purposes of (2a)"strategic", locally controlled oil, and for the simple (2b) prosperity of the American oil patch and its highly connected people.
---------------------------------------

foa: ORO, the oil patch was hated in New York and Washington. Two different cultures, you know. The Government just wanted them to produce oil and shut up. If they needed to make money in the process, so be it. The "oil windfall profits tax" later proved the point that oil was more seen as a "public utility" for "monetary policy". Not something that was privately owned.

Your words:-----------------------
Which do you see as having been more significant? Or was it a monetary decision based on a new concept in commodity money? Or, what I consider more probable, that it killed so many birds in one stone that it was just too attractive to let go without one good try? The additional seignorage
from this concept would also have made it attractive.

Besides, considering that the US was then so far outsude of any possible internal remedy to its gold receipt (dollar) printing problem, it was just a matter of a few months till it would all have broken apart in 1968 - the Fed and the government then facing the hard choice between having a banking system or a currency. I can see that the system was saved in 69, when the London gold market moved to gold pricing in dollars and the OPEC countries stopped taking currencies other than dollars. The US managed to even stretch that arrangement past the breaking point. ----------------
-------------

foa: ORO, my friend, they were not using this concept as a real "commodity money play" in the "gold standard perception". At that time we were buying local oil with "fiat dollars" (made so by the 1933 internal gold confiscation) and foreign oil with "gold dollars". But, as you pointed out, dollar production was so far past it's "gold backing" that it was obvious they (USA) were pegging dollar printing to oil prosperity. Still, with London gold and oil mostly settled in dollars, the foreign dollar
oil deals fully well expected to cash in unneeded dollars for gold. As we can see, reality and present day events of that time were as "mismatched" as today!
All of the dollars success was ultimately made possible because oil could (and was) priced so far below it's "economic worth" to the world. At that time, even our Middle East friends had no idea just how useful oil would (and had) become to maintaining the world economic base. As we will
see in a minute.

Your Thoughts: as I break them apart and comment

-----------------------
Yes, among the true drivers of the US economic boom was the cheap domestic oil it enjoyed till the mid 60s. Economic freedom in the US was limited since Roosevelt took away our few remaining economic freedoms and the cash. The timing of the break in US oil production belies the truth of your analysis of the thinking behind this ingenious way of solving a stupid and costly problem. The steep drop of US oil production, as if off a cliff was impressive. But there were many alternatives to the solution chosen; oil could be imported and stored, and that would have set the price for internal production.-----------------------

foa: No, they were already shipping so many dollars out and any more would further aggravate the "possible gold drain perception". This was everyone's problem then as the industrialized world wanted to still get gold if needed, but they also liked the "non inflationary" (relative to that time) expansion of the dollar base as it expressed the new oil economy and it's real goods produced wealth. The US wanted new oil reserves to be "Local" (the Americas), because it could be paid in "fiat 33" cash, not the more golden "foreign cash". Both our neighbours to the north and south ever asked for much gold. In this light they acted like the local oil companies that received post 1933
dollars for oil (as mentioned above). Yet, to get these new reserves for fiat 33, they had to prevent the very cheap Middle East oil from supplying it all (if dollar prices were higher).

---------------
Oil imports could have been taxed to provide local and "most favoured" neighbours with better prices. ------------------------------

foa, they could have, but they didn't?? A lot of conflicting international political agendas with that one.

-----------------
The reason the US went off of gold did have to do with oil offering backing for the dollar, on an "as needed" basis, but there was a reason that was necessary. The reason was the meteoric rise of government expenditure in that era. The US was throwing fiscal and balance of payments caution to
the winds till the last day before going off the gold standard. That day marked the end of the government expansion relative to the economy.
The 14% of GDP level seen in 1969-1971 was never seen again. In reality, we are back below 1959 levels at 11%, while the Federal government has shrunk to some 3.5% of GDP from the former peak of near 7% in 1970. ------------------------

foa, Again, I pointed out above, the new found prosperity from cheap dollar oil was being used to justify mountains of dollar debt. As long as a barrel of oil could be used to produce more relative real wealth than the dollars used to buy it represented, dollar inflation worked in the only political measurement that counted. "An increase in the standard of living"! Don't get me wrong, I didn't say,
"an increase in the value of savings", that's something else in the minds of "Western Thinkers". Further: GDP measurements and SOL (standard of living) are clearly not relevant to each other then or today. All through the 70s the American worker groaned under a financial / currency
system gone bad. Yet, compared to the SOL of even Japan, we were always way ahead!

------------------------The question that comes at this point, is why were the Arab oil suppliers willing to do this? Was it because their oil would continue to be priced in gold, and this whole thing with the dollar just did not matter? Why did Europe go along with this scheme?

I think it was the "strategic" element of the time, a malevolent and reluctant Soviet system and China in complete chaos in the "cultural revolution", led by psycopathic crackpots, that played a part in convincing Europe and Oil to back the scheme. There was a need to continue support for the US so that it could retain/gain superiority over the Soviets. The "exorbitant privelege" had to be maintained for both the sake of the US and of Europe. For Arab oil, pricing was fine so long as they got their "fair" amount of gold per barrel. The Europeans would pay for the US military sevice by taking US dollars. Do you see this as the "whole" of the strategic significance of the deal?
--------------------------------------

foa: ORO, First and foremost, everyone was caught flatfooted as the dollar broke from gold. Like I said above, the industrial world loved the dollar expansion in the oil context presented. Caught between what appeared as a good system based on cheap oil and the loss of gold delivery, they let it drift too far. Even as we left gold behind (71) and oil went up (78), the system still worked because oil was perhaps delivering $100.00 worth of value and being brought for $30. Yes, this new price did create a financial panic, but more so because everyone was leveraged for the status quo, not a rising price. Like a company business slowing down because they expected 100% profits and invested in equipment for it, yet only got 50%.
The producers never expected the cartel to get such a high price from their political embargo. They also wanted more dollars to compensate for the gold loss, yes. But the runup they got demonstrated to them just how good their product was. They thought a barrel was worth so much
gold (pre 69-71), yet after the fact (71-79), it was worth much more gold than they were ever getting. It was a real education.
As far as going along with the deal, they didn't! Hence the gold runup. But, I tell you that little gold run was nothing compared to what could have happened if they pressed for it. Later they experimented with circulating dollars as a stop gap measure until another system could come along.

FOA - some comments - Part II

Your words: ---------------------The problem of oil as money is in two ways, it is wealth when it is in the ground, but it is a medium of exchange when it is taken out, shipped and used. It must retain a wealth money to back it up. The wealth money was to be found in the gold exchange of oil
to gold, as I take your view. Or, as ANOTHER put it, gold and oil must travel in opposite directions. ---------------------

foa: ORO, once oil is "used" it reverts back into it's wealth (and real money) in the form of the real goods produced. This "spent" oil wealth / money can be retrieved by buying some of these real things with dollars. Still, the portion of real value regained is very small compared to the oil wealth / money spent. This loss of value is partially viewed as payment for your " "strategic" element" "
mentioned further above. But, this is a gross amount to pay for this protection. Much more than regular financial thinkers understand. As such, this loss is made up by receiving a "kicker" in the form of cheap gold provided from a "paper contract marketplace". A market that reduces the
amount of real gold world investors hold by replacing it with "dollar derivative gold contracts" based on the price movements of gold. This concept has lured "hard money" players into an illusion and allowed the flow of real gold to move opposite of oil. It is this simple. (smile)

Your thoughts---------------------
The next issue, that of the US government floating currency in proportion to oil production through the 60s, in effect assuming that the oil, rather than gold is what actually backs the dollar, I can see that thinking in much of the theory written in the decade before, namely by Friedman and the Chicago School, but the problem I had then, and have now, is that the currency itself does not in reality allow for any value whatsoever so long as there is no direct arbitrage between the currency and its backing. In the US there was no arbitrage into oil. It was only by the tight control of oil supplies in one tiny block, and the happinstance of gold just being controlled on the other side of the trade that made this work, and as badly as it had.--------------------

foa: ORO, fiat currency today is little more than a future contract (I posted on this before) of human production. Yet, our SOL (standard of living) could not exist without it. Presently we are in a transition between "wealth money concept" and "digital money concept". History has proven over and over that fiat money can never be a valuable as "real wealth". Through out time, everything real we own has represented both out wealth and a spend able (tradable) money, gold included. Early on, paper money had no other purpose than to represent real things in contract form. Today, even with all it's government manipulations, that paper settles high speed trade better than real wealth
contracts (dollars backed by gold?) because it can match the efficiency advancements with a growing money supply. And do so without revalueing the currency upward (deflation) in the way hard money requires. It's a hard perception to stay with, I know, but people have proven that they want their currency to stay even with economic function, not move up in value against it. Modern humans (not necessarily western) would rather hold their wealth in part in real things (gold) and settle trade in digital currency.
There is a precedent to this even in the history of our world gold supply. As a pure hard wealth money, it does increase in amounts (ounces mined) over time. During the old world growth rates this could have worked, but gold supply cannot match modern advancements without rising in value
far higher than even I project. Truly, digital currencies can work for a modern world, if only they are not backed to gold in contract (fixed gold standard) form. Most of this latter days currency problems have been in trying to keep a "hard digital money concept". It has not worked.
Yes, the percent system has blown itself completely away from official inflation. Inflation far beyond any future human production. Still, had we witnessed a true "free trading" "physical bullion only" market place for gold and allowed it to function in a goods buying settlement,,,,,,,it would have marked to the market the over production of currencies. OK, now that we understand this:


You now state many of our modern money problems in
Your thoughts:--------------
The economic expansion of the 50s and 60s in Europe and Japan was no less than that of Asia in the 80s and 90s, astounding. Similar to that growth that the US had under a tight gold standard from the end of the Civil War to the first World War.

The reality of deflation in a commodity money economy is fine if the banking system is either a "free banking" system (government is not involved but for prosecution of fraud), or the banks are regulated to disallow them the fractional reserve system completely, so that the fiction of having
bank debt balances being presented as money is removed. Thus the bank issues bonds or depository receipts (only for vault reserves) but can not stretch the meaning of customer balances to mean "cash". Thus banks are forced to either live up to their fiction in free banking, or prohibited
from the fiction altogether. The interest rates of the period before the Fed then were tremendously low. There was such a thing as a perpetual bond. Innovation was tremendous. Though this period was punctuated by bank runs galore, the system - as a whole - worked. This despite banks being
allowed their fiction and their being supported by many legal priveleges. There is no economic reason for fiat currencies at all.

The only reason is political. To allow government seigniorage and to allow its sometime friends in banking the assymetry of risk that raises their profitability and assures the great banking famillies of retaining control of their franchise at public expense. It also ended up costing them "ultimate" control in that their banks are now edifices of contracts that are all backed by the government
printing press and thus in constant danger of political expediency changing against them.

The expansion of currency in relation to the growth of the economy is simply another way for government to tax its people. In the case of the US, it was a way for the US government, in its true Roman idiom, to tax the world as a whole. That it was necessary is arguable. I would venture to
say that by 1959 it was not necessary at all. Europe had grown to the point of being able to support itself militarilly. The US was fearful of an armed Europe going communist, not needing the US and its military. Not paying tribute/protection money.

No, FOA, there was never a danger of deflationary spirals forming if the US had not insisted on socializing banking costs as the cost of the political bargain for subjugating the whole of the country's wealth to direct Federal government control. Did the war/wars both cold and hot make
this the only politically acceptable way? I think that was not the only way, even when going into a prolonged "cold" war. What it was for is obviously to "disappear" the cost to both Americans and Europeans. The decision to back the dollar with oil was based on any new concept, it was simply a new way for the US government to retain control of its economy through currency control. I could venture a guess as to Hayek being an intellectual backer of the compromise plan (compromise between reality and the wish of the Johnson and Nixon era bureaucracy to retain hegemony), since he understood well how oil is important economically, and how a currency works. .---------------
--------------------
foa: above you say:
"The decision to back the dollar with oil was based on any new concept, it was simply a new way for the US government to retain control of its economy through currency control."

ORO, I could not agree more. This was not a new concept, rather "A" concept that became "the official unwritten policy" that few understood outside Washington. It also evolved into a way for "others" to keep the dollar game going until a replacement was found. Indeed, our Officials now see the threat clearly.


More of you:---------------
Second point on deflation is that it is healthy for the debt system. It removes assets from the weak and moves them to the strong. Businesses often fail, but rarely do the assets of the business disappear.It is only those businesses built on complete folly or on speculation that routinely fail
leaving behind no assets. It is this environment that spawns 1% short/2% long interest rates, at which the rate for gold remains to this day.--------------------

foa: Deflation under the old system deflation (rising value of cash gold) worked because it brought the dept in line with the rate of growth. A rate (growth) that was much lower then. Let's face it, during the last 30 years economic production and it's real debt rates of growth (not the
gross manipulated debt rates of present) were off the scale of anything ever seen from the beginning of time! Given the choice of borrowing "PHYSICAL" gold from a true physical market at 2% for trade settlement against borrowing "physical dollars" at %10, the dollar would have been
pushed from "actual market forces" to slow it's inflation to match real modern world growth. Match this against trying to keep a government treasury from issuing "too many" fake dollar gold contracts and it's no contest. It never worked.

ORO again:-------------------------
Regarding oil as money, my second point is that oil has a couple of problems as money backing -one is its low value density, it is too expensive to move around for trade. The second is its susceptibility to political disruption. Both as wealth when it is in the ground and as delivery contract
relying on retention of smooth transport conditions (as exchange money), the black gold is not as safe as the actual stuff, and hoarding it is very costly. The only ways to trade it are in the form of obligations ("oil debt") or as title to oil reserves.--------------------

foa: I covered this far above. No one was ever trying to actually use physical oil as money. Rather they (USA) were using the disparity of real oil worth to cover the inflation of the dollar.


ORO:-----------------
While dwelling on this, there is still another set of details to this issue. The electronic settlement demands on currency make no difference as to its backing. It can be gold certificates, it does not have to be fiat paper (a promise as empty as the vault). Even as broadly usable a commodity as oil, its marginal utility is lower when available at greater quantity - its price relative to other goods falls. A money must have a steady marginal utility. As the world grew to make better use of oil out of necessity, due to an artificially inflated cost and an artificial scarcity, the world lost much to the new oil backed dollar. It had to deal with an oil cost based on the cost of producing oil in the "strategically" preffered but economically absurd location. The capital cost, the wasted engineering talent, and the years of discomfort in cramped cars and public transport (particularly in Europe) are
but the tip of the enormous ice-berg this piece of idiocy cost.

There is no benefit whatsoever derived from the oil being local but for its strategic significance for military and political reasons. No amount of theory can find a benefit from the waste of resources on a problem we did not face (at least not for another 30-50 years at the time) and from the
uneconomic consumption of the intermediate range reserves. Now we have broken the natural cost structure of the oil industry and put in a big hole between the low cost oil and the high cost oil. In the meantime, we have destroyed the coal mining industry with a boom and bust cycle, we drove
natural gas exploration too early and wasted it, We broke down the economies of many nations. This folly did not allow the growth of the world economy to proceed unempeded by the restraints of gold, it slowed down the world's growth and diverted its energies.------------
---------------
foa: Yes, to all except one." " " There is no benefit whatsoever derived from the oil being local but for its strategic significance for military and political reasons. " " "

As time went by (80s on), Europe encouraged this arrangement because backing dollar creation with foreign oil allowed a self destruct function.
Under the old gold standards, it was up the individual nation to pay out gold against it's money. A process especially usefull to others if said money was inflated. Still, modern power structures proved that this did not work. A large nation would just not pay out gold if it didn't want too. The US did this locally (1933) and internationally (1971). So what good does it do to back a currency with gold it that gold reserve is in the same nation? Obviously, none!
By allowing the US to back it's economic viability (and therefore it's currency over time) with further oil settlement, it allowed the removal of said settlement (backing) at a later date. Especially if another, closer to home and more appealing reserve currency came about. Unlike gold reserves, that resided in the US, playing the present oil deficit against the US economic need of this oil is
proving much better. Oil is a real commodity need, that must be paid for. A local (USA) oil reserve deficit can bust the dollar value if foreign oil rises in price. Much more so if oil is pegged in Euros while "parity" is in range!


More ORO--------------
I suggest two things regarding the ill-conceived ideas of the decision makers of the time. (1) Their motive was not to secure "strategic" oil supplies alone, but to make sure the whole world pays the price of this strategic decision, whether they want to or not. (2) In the way a large debtor can destroy his creditors, the US and the global banking system built around its rag of a currency did not want to lose control of their banking and commercial empires through the process of bankruptcy, and resorted to threatening their creditors with it. The resulting rollover of US debt resulted in perpetuation of the problem for the next generation, and allowed the continuation of American debt accumulation.

We stop and share the view!

In the early 90s the world was not experiencing any visible results from our new Euroland currency creation (Euro). On the surface things continued much the same as before. The EMU (European Monetary Union) was somewhat in order, but most of the world financial analyst completely wrote off any of it's possible effects on the dollar. A view that was accepted because the US and the dollar were becoming ever more dominant in world affairs. Still, an increasing dollar reserve base impacted the economies of foreign nations as the US dollar trade deficit and the debt
that represented it expanded without relief.

I'm told that an excellent graph of this is still available on the net at the above link. It shows how
dollars have been building up overseas without fail from 1976. Yet, in this visual expression of dollar flows we can see the first fluctuation of a new currency order taking shape. Between 91 and 94 our dollar flows made an abrupt turn for the negative. Some would say that this was just a
function of the dollar becoming stronger. We say it represents a new "hands off" policy by foreign decision makers. This turn was in effect allowing the dollar to enter a multy year self destruct mode, during which deficit dollar flows would expand into oblivion. The US would be flooding the world with dollar reserves at the exact beginnings of Euro success.

After over two decades of non-stop foreign dollar inflation, the dollar float had become so large that any transition from dollar settlement into "Other" settlement would permanently remove it from reserve status. This forward looking thinking would eventually be spelled out in the events directly before us today. In these events we will witness and document the "Facts" of a dollar fall from
grace.

Unlike past bouts of local US price inflation affecting dollar value perceptions, this transition from dollar reserve use will be felt first in currency exchange rates as the Euro slowly replaces the dollar as the major trade holding. The later impact from this will be a massive "super hyper price inflation" in the local US marketplace. Much the same as seen in the third world country panics in Asia. But
prior to this, the largest of all currency exchange rate transitions will try to express itself. That will be the true dollar value exchange rate of gold. A transition so large and all consuming that it will completely wreck the present leverage in the paper contract gold market we today call "the gold market". Long before this new real physical price of gold is realized, the marketplace will stop all
function as physical deliveries, at any price come to an end for a time. Eventually, a world physical market will return.

Onward for another view:

The strong US economic success has been spelled out more in the our SOL (Standard Of Living) than if expressed in financial accounts. Dollar exchange rates, interest on dollars, stock market values, home values all represent what an American "can buy" if they decide to spend their wealth. Not what they presently have as owned wealth, paid up 100%. This leveraging of dollar affairs has created an "illusion of savings" that in effect allowed a high SOL. In other words, we live high on the hog today because our present equity values and savings don't really exist. Time has
transformed the entire dollar system into a giant "futures contract" that only represents the wealth we could obtain in partial "future purchases". Just like the gold market, we mostly trade paper wealth and call it real. Yet, if a large percentage demand for delivery ever happened, the contracts
would fail. Yes, our wealth and economy status is really based on us cashing in and buying just a little at a time. if we didn't, the illusion would be exposed. Only our present dollar economy is "super leveraged" not just into the future of US goods production, rather it also completely depends on future foreign fulfilment to produce those real goods. Truly, most of our present sizeable financial
wealth is little more than a function of the "acceptance of dollars overseas" by others.

Few locals today consider the view from the other side. They proclaim that the dollar is king because the "others" want to spend it here. It's the very same mentality of a gambler that's winning. He doesn't want to hear that the house is on fire and will accept any other "good news" that
prolongs his current "prosperity". In reality, if the above dollar deficit chart was ever forced (from outside pressures, Euro?) into reverse, no amount of real US goods production could be brought using present dollar price rates. In other words, foreigners could never spend their dollars at a rate that matches our SOL values. Indeed, some of the biggest players now know it! It's all an illusion
that has spanned 25+ years from the loss of the gold standard and it's about to be tested.

Onward as we look behind and before us:

In the 90s, big oil understood what was driving the acceptance of dollars. And from my earlier posts, we can grasp how their knowledge was gained through the oil embargo effect. Still, as long as international oil could be settled in dollars at prices well below it's economic value return, US debt, dollar reserves and dollar investments looked very good This train would run as long as another system was being built. Keep oil cheap and the dollar deficit flood would continue.

Why would they do this for free? They didn't and neither did Euroland! People "in the know" knew the effects a new reserve currency would have on dollar values. They also knew the future impact on physical gold. As long as the gold market kept gold priced at a discount to the real value
of oil, buying some gold with excess oil dollars more than made up for any loss of investment or loss of reserve values. Europe needed this concept to work and they helped maintain the present gold market trend for this purpose. A good way to wait for a dollar retirement, no? If the Euro was not born (a real possibility a few years ago) big oil was more than prepared to include physical gold settlement into it's payment package. Just a minor inclusion of gold would have gunned the market and replaced any lost investment gains from a botched Euro introduction. So, the participation in gold and gold banking made good sense.

Indeed, even now the paper gold market expressed a major "duality" in real value depending on the strategic location of it's contracts. Some leveraged gold banking backed with Euroland guarantees is today far superior after the Euro success. (I think this concept is hard on most people.
Still, it will look much different after the train wreck that coming.)

Going further into the duality values from my earlier "overviews"; Oil prices today are on the rise and doing so in total conflict to perceived marketplace function. It's no mistake as to why this dollar price rise is happening now after the Euro was born (we have been discussing this for some time). Just as a high gold price would expose the dollar by presenting it's true past inflation (world dollar
money supply growth), a rising oil price exposes the US economy to the super leverage it contains. Especially if one can grasp how that economy was built on oil backing through dollar settlement. Once the threat of a dollar slump is made possible by high oil, expect big oil to run to Euro
settlement for international trade. Perhaps run is not a good word? Let's just say a transition will begin that shows the world the trail ahead. This is the period when the Euro will rise very much against the dollar (2.00 or 3.00 Euros per dollar?). As oil becomes cheaper in Euros, their local
economy (Euroland) will experience a dramatic positive shift in activity relative to the US and other countries tied to US trade. Does Japan sound like one on the wrong side? (TownCrier, yes, no?)

Because the ECB has no pressing need to keep gold prices in place, gold could initially run in Euros also. Still, eventually Euro gold prices will not be anywhere close to dollar gold prices as international dollar reserves are liquidated. In effect, the disgorging of dollar reserves will show no negative accounting on ECB books as gold prices more than make up for dollar reserve destruction. In fact, once the Euro becomes the world reserve, there will be no reason to hold dollars at all.

Onward, looking only forward:

In fits and starts, oil prices will keep rising based on an expected reserve currency transition, not dollar oil use economics. Any substitution of alternate oil resources in the US will run head long into a local cost inflation roadblock. $200 dollar crude will not be seen as enough to drill for reserves nor switch to other fuels.

The Euro will keep taking market use share from the dollar, especially if major US players continue to trade the Euro down to parity. Eventually (and presently as this is happening now), dollar reserves held outside the US will be forced into shorter and shorter maturities as the "return
on" these holdings becomes more important than their "use as trading currency". This will drive dollar rates far above Euro rates, draining liquidity and forcing the Fed to continue "Most" of it's pumping action (what so many thought was Y2K related). Rising dollar rates will be in response to
this new currency problem, not the present non-existent local US inflation. Later, the fed will be seen as far behind the inflation combating yield curve. However, these rising rates will fully cap the local stock market. Weather it falls will depend entirely on how fast hyper inflation later accelerates. In this environment, foreign exchange controls will play a major negative roll in pricing stocks.

Gold will, at some time meet it's 2nd bout of paper destruction. The next will be far worse. If the currency crisis becomes in full view, there will be no small physical gold lenders to soften the blow. We shall see.

Hello Solomon,
Good post!
Your point about how average citizen there has a " "dramatically lower material quality of life" " is something I completely agree with. I have known more than a few of them. This is the real difference between their "leveraged experiment" and ours (US). Theirs was based more on trading
with America and it's dollar to the effect that it built "paper asset wealth", not a better SOL (standard of living). Because we own and print the reserve currency, we gained the same "leveraged wealth" but also increased the SOL. When this system fails, they will never have had anything to show for it. This is the road they are on now as their currency function has run flat into a failing dollar world. Hyper inflation is in their future!
Their social fabric and organizational skills did create a producing machine, but at what cost in human means? You see, it's impossible to produce yourself rich if you trade the efforts for some "rights to future buying power" like the dollar.
I wish we could all operate a well as they do and also use their ethics (well some of them). Perhaps, in a later time, across this dollar valley we will unlock the creative spirit in all nations as have the Japans done for themselves.

Mr. Weaver, you write:

-----------------But will you not agree with me that the example of how the dollar could leave gold behind or how the Japanese could bootstrap themselves as an island nation with no resources to have more wealth than any Arab nation who has all the oil and gold...that these examples show that
"the creation" of wealth in the future is not connected to gold ownership.-----------------

Solomon, gold ownership does not create wealth, it retains wealth created. Just because gold today has a massive amount of past "wealth representation" hidden from view, does not mean that the new owner of gold will have had gold create this new wealth for him! It's no different than if you found a $100 bill on the street, "it's new "wealth representation" created by someone else and found by you". This is our main story. I think far too many confuse out thrust for gold today with "trading for profits" motives. This is not the case.

Further you say: ---------

But, humanity, and its technological economy is evolving into something which will always be filled with debts and promises...if it were to all collapse today..the gold owners would feel rich but there would be a lot less they could buy....----------------------

foa: Unlike most die-hard gold bugs, I view gold as another form of wealth currency in transition. Not a run for the hills the world is falling investment. Yes, the US will lose a lot of not real wealth. But, as I have said so often, this is a perceived wealth based on an illusion. We will not lose something we don't have. Still, I expect a great deal of prosperity as this progresses. Just as many other countries
have suffered tremendous loses as the US gained a greater SOL, the reverse can also happen. Many think that without a US powerhouse, the world will fail. It never has and never will. Just a Clark Gable (Mr. Butler in "Gone with the wind") travelled the world after the Civil war, I submit
that the same world will be waiting modern travellers that retain their real wealth.
As you say " " humanity, and its technological economy is evolving" " , I agree and it will not stop if the US pulls back.

Also you note: --------------
.I see the large owners of gold taking gold out of the vaults and consigning artists to fashion massive sculptures each weighing several tons (about $10 billion of today's dollars and maybe $100s of billions later on). In time, there might be about 10,000 of these statues fabricated. They would be displayed in public places like banks, corporate headquarters, governmental buildings, world fairs, etc. Each sculpture would............. (and the rest of your post)

I can assure you that most of the people I know who are highly leveraged, own no gold (not even gold equities) and are mostly invested in US equities for the most part do BELIEVE their perceptions however misconceived are their individual (and collective) reality.------------

foa: It's only been in the most recent period that such great wealth is held as "documented contract bookkeeping entries". Weather these numbers are stock values or saving accounts, they are all derivatives that indicate what "someone could buy, not what they have brought. As a percentage of American holdings, the actual converted and paid up wealth in the form of real useful things (cars,
houses, furniture, etc.) is tiny compared to the overall leveraged paper wealth holdings.
Most people equate the system like this:

" " I can cash out my winnings anytime and buy a gold bar. In fact, I did sell a little today and brought a Maple leaf. This proves that we can time our exit for our benefit" "

Truly, what this person is missing is that his actions completely mimic the overall American system and are what preserves it. Just as I equated the dollar to a gold futures contract, so too is the total dollar economy. In this system, we are, every day, taking delivery of some goods (comex gold delivery), just not total delivery as stated in the "full money supply" context (comex open interest).
As long as all of us don't try to buy with more than 5% of our assets (calling for delivery for say 100 contracts), the system works. Yes, any economic system operates with some relative savings for future delivery (retirement, saving for school, etc.), it's just the gross extent of our leverage
today has no possible comparison. The present risk is outside any historical precedent.
Without any yardstick for measurement, most people are comfortable that their paper wealth is somewhat real and remain with it. Only now, the foreign holdings of dollar assets has grown so large that if it "comes home for delivery", it will break the system without our buying help!

Your words:-----------------
I submit to you there are very troubled (social unrest) waters ahead in this country if events progress as you forecast. What do you think?-------------------

foa: C Man, from the beginning of time people have been gathering and losing what they have. It seems that as a people, it's our lot in life to, periodically do battle over "who took what from who" and "who failed to honour their contracts to deliver". It's nothing new. However, there is a
recent precedent that says things will be bad locally but not internationally.
The recent downfall of a world "nuclear super power" happened without a world war or the use of weapons of mass destruction. Russia was bankrupted without a shot being fired at the west for doing it. Does this mean that the US will sit still as it's dollar is gutted on the international markets?

You say: ---------------I remember the animosity paid toward ME persons and nations during the 70's due to the oil crises. Americans can become inhospitable with great alacrity when it comes to their gasoline. How can all come to pass (as it evidently must) without major domestic and
(hopefully not) international upheaval? Add xenophobia to politics and the recipe for disaster becomes written upon all minds.------------------

foa: I think that locally, the US will experience some bitterness as people realize what they never had. We borrowed so much from our unborn children that it could never be paid back. So, the international community changes the rules in a way that forces us to pay our own way now and we don't like it. Interesting, our debt supports a life style higher than most of the world and anarchy is
expected if we must repay it.

We will all have to see how this plays out. thanks FOA

But FOA, there is one factor, it could be minor, I don't have the context knowledge to judge, which may affect your thinking a bit. Oro, you especially may be able to put this into context in terms of "strategic" value.

Clearly the size of the reserves is significant. The question is, is it significant enough to affect your

Hello Journeyman,
If not another drop of foreign oil was imported into the US, world oil production could be cut in half and still receive the same dollar revenue as today. You see, oil prices are only one part of this drama. Dollar use and value outside it's reserve roll is the main problem.

In addition, as stated before, even $200 a barrel for west texas crude may not spur oil shale development if local dollar price inflation becomes too great.

Hello Strad Master,
The same answer above applies to your question of using the US oil reserve. Also, in the past it was a real political card to play, Today, it's just a card.

You ask:-------------
2.) Would it be prudent for those who speculate to buy Euros with dollars and just hold them against an inevitable price rise you see in the relative near future? -------------

I would say one should choose their savings accounts with all the considerations offered here. The world financial system is always slipping like an earth fault. The question is can your wealth survive a full quake? For myself, Euros look just like a regular way to save some of my money.

Also:-----------

Do you remember my question of a few days ago about the circumstances in which you and Another might reveal your identities? Is that ever a forseeable possibility? ----------------

foa: the major push of these posts is that you look for economic events that explain where we have been walking. If they tell you your trail is correct, then we are thinking for ourselves and perhaps seeing the world as others do. Not knowing us forces you to look closely with your own eyes.

On another subject:

ALL:
I view this forum as a large discussion group on the floor of a convention hall. Each of us roaming between different faction groups, listening first, then taking part in the debate. From group to group we walk taking in all the fine new points. We can best be viewed as a large body of
people all adding to the information pool in a mostly serious, thoughtful way.

Then some kid runs up and stands at the sidelines and shouts out a few good thoughts and immediately says "To the Forum: You're all stupid and being mind controlled!". Then he makes a face, sticks his tongue out and runs away. During this episode, most discussion stops, everyone looks, tries to respond, but eventually goes back to work.

So, should we have security lock these nuts out? Well, in my opinion, early on we don't have to as long as we understand them and they don't ruin the whole convention. By understanding them I mean; they are smart and have something to offer, but when they make a face at everyone, it's just
an expression of "emotion without real background" not serious thoughts or discussion. Just as we all have children or young relatives that visit, we usually tolerate their behaviour until the talk (and events) becomes more serious. Then they must leave.

As "PH in LA" once put it, "they come in with both guns blazing and never read the rules". Indeed, they don't care about any "groups" rules! They want to spit on you if they feel like it and proclaim that that's the only way for adults to communicate! They dirty the air with innuendoes that our very own conversation (yes, our private talk) is half truths and dishonest. And point out that no one here is smart enough decipher this. In the end, it's demonstrated that some children, even though they are now old and have been around are no more than just "old immature kids with an
attitude"! A mind set that abhors humility and is usually brought on from a lack of real success in life.

Last "overview" for a while
Hello TownCrier:
I read your "Golden View" about the Euroland Gold valuations in (TownCrier(01/18/00; 20:42:11MDT-MsgID:23158).
Do we see the beginnings of a new official gold market being traded through the BIS system. One could almost see where the gold is moving into the EMCBs and only being traded and valued in Euros. We have promoted this shift for some time and anticipate it to grow as Euro use in the
international community expands. Especially as the Swiss sales begin. This lack of CB bullion liquidity will eventually starve the London paper gold system, mostly a dollar settlement system for the maintenance of dollar gold prices. Again, it (Euroland agenda) was a process that was designed some time ago and implemented with the Washington Agreement. Indeed, the WA is not the end of this "changing of the rules".

Further:

True, they (BIS) move a lot of gold for CBs and always have. Only, this time (from 1990 to date) they have shifted their agenda in favour of the ECB system. A shift that will strengthen the Euro as it weakens the dollar. This entire evolution of BIS direction and support has taken Washington, Britain and most economic thinkers by surprise. Yet, over the last twenty years it was a very visible and logical move with the Continent coming closer and closer to a new common
currency. It's no secret that they (BIS) became ever more apart from political dollar support as this (Euro)new weapon was growing. We can trace this shift's beginnings from the Jamaica Accords (mid 70s)and the first creations of the EEU (European Economic Unit)(early 80s). Later (mid to late 80s) the BIS fully promoted the EMS (European Monetary system) and used it's stability as a selling point around the world. This new architecture is what drew in Arabia to become a member and now sees a new BIS office in Hong Kong (opened in 98??). China will be the next member and a big Euro / gold suporter.
The entire (current) process involves a gradual weakening of the gold market (the paper function of it, not the paper price) to match the Euro expansion (5 years per the WA timeline?). I expected the paper gold marketplace to fail sooner and fall into discount. But the market has yet to fully grasp the impact of these events and still bids contract gold at par. However, we look at the dramatic
speed of this change (Euro acceptance) and can see gold coming into severe stress much sooner now. At the rate that Euro financing (and use) is growing, they will be imploding the paper gold market much sooner as they must revalue gold faster.
We watch for the dollar to come into real stress when the LBMA has it's system tested. This is where the real currency transition begins to grow! Again, I do not offer our words as proof, watch for events to confirm. As Another said, "Time will prove all things"!

Also:

Our stance is and always has been that the world will be using paper digital currencies for the rest of our lifetime. I for one, have never heard any official voice his stance that we will move back into a gold standard. Their (Euroland) direction has always been to keep a reserve currency system and strengthen it with a free physical gold market trading in the background. In none of our meetings have we heard where a fear was expressed that the governments will lose control of digital currencies and give it (that control) back to gold. That is simply not going to happen, no matter how severe a down turn the loss of the American dollar system creates. Believe it.
This has been the fundamental thrust of this news. The dollar system is failing as we move into another stronger (relative to fiat currencies) money system. I support, use and promote the new Euro simply because it is and will create the next trend for the future. Not because it's a gold currency of extra hard value. This (Euro) future will see us all using digital currencies, for better or worse. Therefore, by logical extension if I must use a reserve currency of account, I move into one that has the best strategic ability to survive and denominate my assets. In addition, it's creators are restructuring the gold market to the physical bullion holders advantage. This is the only reason I "Walk In The Footsteps Of Giants". They created this bullion path and the world will follow in due time. Therefore, my position of Euro assets and physical gold. Mostly (because I am American), I lean to gold for this transition.

Further:

One can take the radical position that the world financial system is going to end without the dollar. You can also say that the Euro will fail as this process evolves. One can buy gold for these reasons only and still prosper, whether your grasp of politics leads you this conclusion or not. Our sole reason for writing is a private commission to share official directions and perceptions with the
average citizen of the world. Nothing else.
Still, stand alone logic and history promote that the world will lose the present system to paper inflation and move into another as it has done before. With this, gold will bankrupt (through extreme price devaluation, $10,000 - $30,000) the outgoing system as hyper inflation runs through it. In a broader view, all total dollar dependent economies (Canada, Mexico, Japan, etc.) will share this fate.
This view gives you no facts only our perceptions from the builders of the future. We offer only the events as they occur for our proof. Indeed, strong events are ahead on this gold trail we all walk.

Hello AL, as you have read all of our posts, one can see how oil is the swing power in this currency war. Their commodity has been used to back the outgoing dollar system for some time and in the process keep it alive. Their price in return was a "cheap gold market" and their percent of return will be a new stronger reserve currency and acceptance of physical gold as a real settlement option in international finance. We will all get a feel for this as the oil prices lead the US dollar, and it's world dependent Economy into a slowdown. At the same time, the entire Euro / gold market
changes will impact world perceptions about their values.

Thanks to everyone for all the excellent imput and discussion here. I have read only a small bit of what was offered, but what I did see was great. Also thanks for supporting a "civil" discussion forum. This method does work the best as contrasting the WTO meeting in Seattle against our current Dravos forum demonstrates.
SteveH, nice work of presenting the "New gold market" in a clear context. It's a good example of presenting something in a professional manner while leaving the emotions at home.
PHinLA, thanks for your post of support. Truly, we must all present our views in a format that allows the audience to think constructively about world events. People always see things more clearly when allowed to compare thoughts, not people.

Besides, in the end, we all spend our short time on earth as faceless fools. Ourselves, we are nothing, but our good perceptions and thoughts travel an endless road as the history of man. Indeed, every crowded road begins life as a small trail insights that are walked by the few. We walk this gold trail of the future, here today on this forum.

I'll try to post one time later (if able). Will close with these two (out of context, but interesting)

ABOUT THE FORUM

The World Economic Forum is the foremost global partnership of business, political, intellectual and other leaders of society committed to improving the state of the world.

Members, constituents and collaborators have a unique opportunity, through their association with the World
Economic Forum, to engage in processes of developing and sharing ideas, opinions and knowledge on the key issues of the global agenda.

The World Economic Forum is an independent, impartial, not-for-profit Foundation which acts in the spirit of
entrepreneurship in the global public interest to further economic growth and social progress.

NEW HEADQUARTERS

In November 1998 the World Economic Forum moved into its new headquarters overlooking Lake Geneva.

The new building reflects the culture of the Forum in the following ways:

Message from the President

There are three reasons our Foundation is so special:

First, we constitute a unique partnership of representatives from business and government. Our basic philosophy is that the great challenges facing humankind as we move into the next century can only be met through joint efforts on the part of government and business. But these efforts have to be stimulated by the best minds and have to be made transparent to the public. In short, what makes the Foundation unique is that we are a truly global community, a global partnership of business, government, academia and the media.

Second, we are not only a unique community; we have a very special role to play.

At the beginning of each year during our Annual Meeting in Davos, we brainstorm to help define the global agenda. At this meeting and, indeed, during our numerous other gatherings throughout the year, we discuss the key political, economic and social issues.

And this leads me to the third reason our Foundation is very special: we all have a responsibility to fulfill its
mission: "Committed to improving the state of the world". We are aware that entrepreneurship is the basis for all
economic and, ultimately, social progress, but entrepreneurship has to take place in the framework of social responsibility. Therefore I call on each of you to keep in mind our motto: "Entrepreneurship in the global public interest."

We are building the network society. This means that elites will more and more disappear. The new network society will be open and access should be guaranteed to everybody. For this reason, the World Economic Forum has increased its exposure by creating a web-site that allows all the members of the global civic society to be integrated into our activities.

Klaus Schwab

Timeline 1970-79


1970
Klaus Schwab, Professor of Business Administration, takes the initiative and the personal risk to convene Europe's chief executives to an informal gathering in the Swiss mountain town of Davos in January 1971, to discuss a coherent strategy for European business to face challenge, in the international marketplace. He secures the patronage of the Commission of the European Communities, as well as the encouragement of Europe's industry associations.

1971
Klaus Schwab founds the European Management Forum, a not-for-profit foundation, as a framework for further
initiatives and activities. The foundation's Annual Meeting in Davos is now considered the global summit which defines the political, economic and business agenda for the year.

1973
Country Forums are created, to bring together the international business community with the political and
economic leaders of specific countries. By 1995, more than 500 such meetings have taken place - in some 30 capitals or at the foundation's headquarters in Geneva, making the foundation the leading interface for global
business/government interaction.

1973
After concentrating at first on management issues, the foundation increasingly integrates into its activities
(after the oil shock) political, economic and social issues. It starts to play a major role in confronting
environmental challenges as expressed, for example, in its role as an official adviser to the Earth Summit in Rio in
1992.

1976
With the creation of the first Arab-European Business Leaders Symposium in Montreux (2000 participants) and
the first Latin American-European Business Leaders Symposium in 1977, foundation activities take on an international dimension.

1976
The foundation transforms itself into a membership organization, becoming the catalyst for the foremost global
business network.

1977
The foundation starts to organize Country Forums in developing countries. In such a way it highlights the
potential of emerging markets and helps to integrate these countries into the world economy.

1979
The publication of the first annual World Competitiveness Report marks the debut of the foundation's research
activities.

1979
The foundation is the first non-governmental organization to initiate a partnership with China's economic commissions and starts activities in China. Since 1980, an annual Business Leaders Symposium is held in Beijing and a high-level Chinese delegation comes every year to Davos. No other organization has brought so many businesses to China; many flourishing joint ventures today originated within the activities of the Forum. The foundation has had a substantial impact on the economic reform policies of China.

Timeline 1980-89


1982
The first Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders takes place on the occasion of the Annual Meeting in Davos, bringing together cabinet members of major countries with heads of international organizations (such as the World Bank, IMF, GATT). This serves as a model for similar initiatives in the global public interest, including: the Club of Media Leaders (editors-in-chief) the annual informal gathering of heads of the world's foremost non-governmental economic research organizations the Informal Gathering of Regional Leaders the Informal Gathering of Global City Leaders the Roundtable of Industry and International Organization Leaders.
All take place on the occasion of the Annual Meeting in Davos.

These "CEO clubs" add an industry orientation to the foundation's well established country-related activities. Today, ten such industry groups exist with more than 400 Governors.

1985
Regular meetings begin in India, which have a substantial impact on the opening-up of the country. Concrete proposals made by business participants are taken into account by the government in shaping its policy.

1988
World Link magazine is launched, covering global business and economic issues for 35,000 decision-makers worldwide, increasing the foundation's publishing activity.

1988
The foundation has played a role in major reconciliation processes in the world, with the first of these initiatives
in 1988. Examples are: Greece and Turkey: after being at the brink of war, signing of the "Davos Declaration" between Prime Ministers Papandreou and Ozal, Davos 1988 Korea: both Koreas meet for the first time for discussions at ministerial level at the Annual Meeting, Davos 1989 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow meet, accelerating significantly the process of German reunification, Davos 1990 East Asia: bilateral contacts lead to the normalization of relations with Vietnam, Davos 1990 South Africa: the first private meeting of all political constituencies of South Africa is held in the Forum's headquarters in Geneva in 1990; the first joint appearance outside South Africa of F.W. de Klerk, Nelson Mandela and Chief Buthelezi brought new impetus to the political transition, Davos 1992 Middle East: Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat reach a viable draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho, moving forward on the road to peace in the Middle East, Davos 1994.

companies with a specific interest in a particular region, such as Asia and Southern Africa. Already more than
half of member companies are headquartered outside Europe.

1994
The first Middle East/North Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca is convened by the World Economic Forum

Is this more clear?
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland
"Informal talks" as reality overcomes illusion.


I was just thinking:
In the January issue of News and Views" from USAGOLD, Michael Kosares noted that; "In my view, we are witnessing the breakdown of the dollar based floating rate system erected in the 1970s to replace the ill-fated Bretton Woods arrangement." He then gave his many good reasons for that view.

I couldn't agree with this more, especially the above statement. The late 60s into the early 70s is where our current gold trail began and today we are seeing more twists in this winding path. From the beginning, our gold marketplace has been little more than a reflection of the same forces political powers exerted upon all world markets. Indeed, gold has never ended it's function of being a major currency component of international reserves. Because of this, it has received the same exchange rate pressures that governments have exerted upon their own paper moneys. Today, our private gold marketplace is maneuvered to act as a proxy for the governments political needs as it (the marketplace) prints gold as needed to impact it's price. No different from the treasuries printing money and intervening in currency exchange markets.

Can there be an end for this?

In these power games we know that nations states always have an agenda. This purpose is slowly revealed as the repeating force of policy direction eventually exposes their thoughts. In time, these political thoughts are shaped into real events for all to see. The recent Washington Agreement
and the BOE gold sale are a prime examples of this. Still, if one can feel the political purpose ahead of time, just the background events can mark a clear trail. From our (Another/FOA) table we offer the "Thoughts" that in time can give birth to official acts.

The Currency Trail and The Gold Trail, two moneys on the same path?

On this forum (USAGOLD) and many others, readers are sometimes exposed to opposite extremes of "money" thought. I submit that History and Logic say neither of these extremes will "Play" in this "Modern Drama".

On the radical side, ........."the serious gold bug" says all currencies will fail and only gold is the correct investment. All currencies are created by the same evil, misguided governments and should be avoided at all costs. Even degenerating into a lower scale of emotion, they point out that all forms of money politics are gross manipulations of the public. All with Secret Agents and a New World Order that controlling the worlds wealth......

The intrigue never ends! I submit that this is a "common view" that's been promoted for 200 years. Today, serious investors know that as a modern people, we can only hold real wealth for endurance, not daily use in commerce. Patiently, knowing that in time society always creates the
political motives that unlock gold's value hidden by the "illusion" of today's reserve currency system. In gold today we find this hidden wealth and observe the march of "Giant Footsteps" in a direction that's unlocking it's value. Still, in the end, society will use a currency system to denominate this wealth transition. A different system, yes, but a digital one never the less!

On the conservative side,...... "the dollar inflation experts" have witnessed the ebb and flow of minor price inflation events over 25+ years and base their preparations on the next event being the same. As such, this view expresses an expectation that this currency (the dollar) will continue on indefinitely in inflation and deflation cycles. It assumes the dollar system has retained the same
fundamental values it had in the past cycles and the world will continue to use it. Yet, hidden below the surface is the rot of massive dollar expansion and the debt that has produced it. Each cycle of economic expansion was built on a greater multiple expansion of dollars. All without an overall increase in productive abilities of the American machine. Indeed, some measures show that the ability of the US to produce goods locally has declined in real terms as they transferred a large portion of said production to other peoples overseas. A dynamic that actually further removes more economic function from backing the dollar money supply.

I submit that this modern "American Experience" of dollar production has completely overtaken the ability of this system to engineer "one more cycle" of regular dollar inflation!

For ourselves, we walk far away from these two concepts. In reality our position remains in the absolute center.

In our view, the buying of physical gold should mostly be form dollar asset holders because this is the currency system that is going to change. A strategy for both foreign and native dollar investors with foreign holders changing settlement to Euros.

Yes, history does show that no currency has ever lasted and all will fail. A point we completely agree with. However, recent history of our modern time clearly demonstrates that as every past national currency failed, the world economy moved on to the next functioning currency system. We have progressed too far in trade efficiencies for us to function without a digital fiat system. For our world, there will be no going back to "gold alone" Therefore, we fully expect, accept and plan for a reserve currency system to be in operation as the old one fails, and so should you. It's a prudent, conservative concept. In this transition, dollar gold prices will best reflect the hyper inflation that will wreck the outgoing system.

Further in our view, we feel that the dollar timeline has ended along with it's past "minor inflation" cycles (8% to 15%). This time a new price inflation will take hold and "run away" as the world evolves into the next system of settlement. Again, the dollar will remain the the US currency unit. America will continue to buy and sell using dollars, much the same as other countries with major inflation It's the reserve currency settlement system that will change and effect the dollar value.

Onward:

Why so much gold now and not before?

It's always been a good individually policy to hold some gold. Especially after circulating gold lost it's ability to function in a modern evolving economic architecture (1933?). Yes, over all these years, one aspect for holding physical is that a natural disaster, a local banking panic or short term trade dispute could find one using gold coins. However, this has always had a short term impact with long-term effects on wealth. Look around at the other national economies that have been destroyed lately (and in the past)? Go there and we find that they are still using the broken, local fiat systems. Had they held some of their savings in gold or strong major currencies, most of their wealth would have remained intact. So, holding some gold (or gold stocks in a foreign account) worked fine.

But today, the world has evolved. In our modern perceptions we hold gold for two reasons. 10% (of the reason) is still for use in a temporary currency breakdown. 90% (of the reason) should be for gold to represent your real wealth in a form that negates the effects of a "failing WORLD DOLLAR reserve currency system", not a just another "local" cycle of inflation.

It's in this second 90% reason that we find the most misunderstanding of our times. Many gold investors of "Western Thought" own some gold for the above 10% reason. The rest of their wealth is denominated in the currency they expect to survive the best, the dollar. In addition, they retain gold derivatives that owe their existence to a world "dollar marketplace". For many years they have lowered their holdings of physical gold and replaced them with these leveraged dollar gold derivatives. All because they accepted the concept that the dollar and it's world markets will remain intact through the next cycle. This massive discarding of real gold has altered the physical marketplace by supplying gold for commodity use and creating a demand for paper gold products. In effect, Western Players shorted real gold, then brought into gold mines that also shorted real gold! To date, the massive volume on the LBMA is a testimony and confirmation of this new gold market based on contract gold.

Again, on one side we hear a conservative voice that says the dollar will complete another cycle of price inflation as past money supply expansion works it's magic. Just like the 70s we will see prices rising 6%, 8% or even 13%. Knowing how money principles work, the average investor has but to position himself in "derivative inflation hedges", gold stocks, oil stocks, REITs and commodity futures. Then wait the cycle out. Expecting some inflation or a partial dollar breakdown, they consider themselves prepared by holding paper wealth based on a continuation of
the dollar marketplace.

Something has changed!

They totally ignore the fact that past dollar inflation produced price inflation, early on. Yet today, world dollar liquidity has grown at huge rates for many years (perhaps a decade) without this price effect many had expected. Some have been positioned, on and off in resource investments that have yet to produce the gains "relative" to those experienced in the 70s inflation. Financial panics come and go, yet dollar use has only increased. The US trade deficit explodes for years with no ill effects. Local and world dollar interest rates remain somewhat tame in the face of what should have been a panic flight from US investments.

All of this clearly points to a currency system that "WAS" being held together and supported by world Central Banks. There is simply no other answer for this action. As this support unwinds, look for the old rules to be broken.

We walk this trail today!

A rising dollar today is an indication of "deflation stress" under the surface. Players scramble to unwind positions as dollar liquidity dries up. The withdrawal of dollar settlement in world financing, savings and CB reserve structure destroyed dollars like soup on a slow boil. In time (like today, like now!), dollar exchange rates are driven up in much the same way the Yen is. The process
represents weakness in the background financial function, not strength inherent in the integrity of the currency. The reverse leverage in the market destroys more assets as the currency rises.

The US Fed must flood the world with money in order to stop the stress. It is! Indeed, the BOJ has and will follow the same course. It's called the final inflation.

The world dollar gold market we all thought we knew will respond in a way not expected. It will fail! Contract gold prices will be stressed from two forces........... From one side, major users of this paper market will flood the market to the full extent of their equity. Creating gold contracts out of nothing but the dollar bank accounts that stand behind them. Just as the Fed is pumping money to try and protect the banking system, so too will gold contracts be created to try and protect the gold banking system ................From the other side; As this unfolds, major demand for physical gold will erupt from official sources world-wide. Not the kind of coin buyer demand we know of
from the past. No, this is the kind of serious buying none of us have ever seen! As the "dollar boil" becomes more obvious it (physical demand) will completely avoid the contract market and go straight into the much smaller dealer market. In effect, allowing contract gold to experience a void on the "buy side" as physical gold completely disappears on the "offer side". Some "traders contend
that they will sell their gold if it goes into the thousands and buy a car, new house, etc.! This from "behind the desk" players that think they will lean back and observe the largest shift in real wealth ever to occur. And do so at a computer screen, no less. No, no they will not! We hear these words in the context of today's soft reality. Later, it's the extra houses and cars that people will be selling
to buy more gold. Believe It!

None of this has happened yet, or has it? From the Washington Agreement to date, all aspects of the contract market have become "strained". Major players have withdrawn from the physical lending markets and left behind a small facade of unbacked "paper lending". Hence the low lease
rates. Some mines are in default on major gold loans and Comex Open Interest falls away. I expect the comex to receive some major use when the next (real!) spike arrives. Perhaps from paper hedging paper? We shall see.

A Story: There are facts, reality and only one's perception separates them.

------A New York plumber walks into a hardware store for supplies. After paying and receiving his change, he accidentally drops a penny on the floor while walking away. The checker points out his lost penny. The plumber says he can't afford to pick it up. The checker asks why? My friend, he says I makes 60.00 an hour. That works out to .0166 cents a second. If I pick up that penny, I'll lose money. In fact, just talking to you cost me .20 cents. Let me out of here or I'll go broke!-------- (smile)

ALL: The world does not think this way, but to hear some people talk you would think it does.

---------When a stock goes from $10.00 to $100.00 the same day, it's reported it went up 1,000%. If it goes down to $50.00 the next day, it's said it dropped only 50%. Yet the investor that brought it for $10, just lost half his 1,000% gain, or -500% down! --------------

--------If we are told that a stock that's been falling for years and is down 95%,,,,,,,,,,often the same bullish trader has been in and out of that issue "all the way down". Most of us would agree that human nature being what it is,,,,,,,,,,, he lost far more than 95% on this long journey! In addition, the "mind set" created from this trip must affect ones judgement of wealth? Often making it
impossible to walk a different trail. ----------------------

I'm back into the sea of thoughts, now. Be back when I can,,,,,,,,,,thanks FOA

Comment
ORO, Cavan Man:
I put the Dravos web site up so everyone could see what they were about (at least some of it). I'm not in their mind set nor do I agree with some of their ideals. It's just a view into their forum agenda.
Also, they are in no way the powerful minds behind the worlds political thrusts. They mostly represent the viewpoints of the major players behind them. It seems that the real movers in this world don't look good on TV, can't talk to audiences and in general do not present their thoughts well. They usually present an agreed architecture concept and leave it to the professionals to implement. At least this is my view and experience of this?

Cavan Man,
What is the USD camp response? Well, the fire has been burning from march of last year. It started small (in the basement) and is spreading now. I think Mr. Greenspan has been trying to put it out with a money spray, but he and everyone else knew that would only work for so long.

We said once before that the game was over and the US would "manage" this crisis to the end. Even to the point of forcing the IMF gold sales into open view and creating a contentious outcry. If you remember, I said last year that the US was coming around to letting gold rise because it's
revaluation could help control the dollar fire. Just like turning around a tanker, the political dollar machine had to slowly reverse to encourage this. Did they know congress would jump on the IMF gold sales and force a revision? It's your guess. Never the less, the IMF is now well on the road to reworking (even more now) it's gold stocks for the purpose of supporting the dollar with higher gold prices.

What a reverse, huh? For years they want gold down, now they want it up. Well, it had to happen once the dollar fire began to burn out of control. Besides, with oil prices spiking, there is an obvious (now) disconnect between low gold prices and cheap oil. Want to bet that the creation of
the Euro had anything to do with this? (smile) Notice that they (USA) signed onto the Washington Agreement. They didn't have to, you know. Are we reading the trail clearly, now?

The only players left in the paper gold market are the final fall guys. All the LBMA people. They now hold the full deck of cards in this modern gold market and the CBs and governments have walked away from them! Yes, their (CBs) support is still there, but only in the form of crisis
management if gold runs completely away. Witness the small CB lending at the height of the last crisis. Truly, the entire world currency architecture is shifting away from supporting the past paper gold market and allowing it to slowly die. At some point (Another says $360) it will begin a real breakdown and close it's doors to trading.

Just as the Fed is now "managing" an all consuming dollar fire, so will the last of the gold bankers "Manage" their now ongoing fire. Eventual, it will take them completely out of the gold banking business and leave a wake of scorched earth. Everyone (and I mean everyone) that must utilize gold derivatives to work this modern market will be hurt by this. Even some major players are showing the road ahead as they must unload big positions in gold derivatives (last Friday) because of (you guessed it) this dollar burning crisis. And we are only just getting started! Who is going to bid for future gold (paper gold) when it's delivery party is being cleaned out on the cash side from an unrelated play? Indeed, will anyone bid for paper gold when they themselves are being skinned in this? You see, there will be no security in dollar gold derivatives when the whole dollar house is on fire. They will bid for metal that is available "right now" or not bid at all! Only the "straight up" "cash bullion only" dealers will come out clean and strong in this. Is this a correct read of the cards all the players are holding? Let's hold some physical, lean back and watch the events unfold. We are "on the road", but the paper prices we watch may spike either way. It's now a political match that's between who can manage the fire best as it finishes it's work.

Back to the dollar: The Europeans are going to eat everyone's economic lunch with this low Euro! Just think, the markets have done for the ECB what the BOJ has been fighting like hell to achieve. Now, they (Japan) must gut their financial system with a "real live inflation" just to get back to a competitive zone (currency wise). Read this analysis someone sent me and then consider that some investors thought Japan was a good play:

-------------------
Japan to Turn to Direct Loans From Its Banks

Jan 30, 01:46


TOKYO, Jan. 28 -- In a striking demonstration of how precarious Japan's financial situation has become, the government plans to borrow money directly from banks to fulfil its obligations to local governments.

Governments normally borrow money by issuing bonds,which is cheaper than taking out bank loans. Japan's unorthodox approach to borrowing now and the size of the shortfall -- 8 trillion yen, or roughly $76 billion -- have stunned economists and other market watchers. With one small exception, this is the first time since the days after World War II that Japan has taken such a step.

The amount is equivalent to roughly 2 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, and exceeds the 7.7 trillion yen the government has injected into troubled banks.

"The funding mechanism is breaking down," said David
Asher, a research fellow in the Japan Program at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The dam is showing more and more stress fractures, and they're trying to put plaster on them."

Concern is rising that Japan is overextending itself. The government's debts now match the country's G.D.P., and Merrill Lynch is predicting a rise to 150 percent of G.D.P. in two years.

The skyrocketing debt, justified by politicians as a way
to keep a faltering economic recovery on track, is
increasingly a point of contention within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

But by side-stepping the traditional reliance on the bond
market, the new borrowing has placed a stark new emphasis on this crushing problem.

"By not issuing bonds, by taking on an intermediary like
a bank," said Jesper Koll, who is chief economist at
Merrill Lynch Japan and is typically upbeat about
Japan's prospects, "you are basically saying one of two
things: either you don't believe in the efficiency of
the financial markets or you're admitting you have a
credit problem."

Now, Mr. Koll said, the government runs the risk of
replicating, on a smaller scale, the trap that brought many Asian economies to their knees recently. "There's a mismatch because they're planning to borrow one year loans, but the municipal deficits are not going away in a year," he said.

There are signs, too, that the government may expand its
borrowing from banks, which are healthier than they were
two years ago. A Finance Ministry spokesman said there
were plans to cover shortfalls in another, unnamed "special account" this way, though the amount in question is far smaller.

The banks, for their part, are likely to welcome the plan. Although the Finance Ministry spokesman stressed that terms had not been set, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, said the government planned to pay 2.1 percent interest -- a handsome premium to the 1.6 percent the banks could earn buying government bonds.

Andrew Smithers, a prominent fund manager, is one of the
few experts who put a positive spin on the plan, saying
it will get more money into circulation, which many
economists have advocated as a way of curing the economy's ills.

Because loan demand is low, banks have too much money
sitting idle. "It's a good measure," he said, "because it further eases monetary policy and relieves pressure on the bond market, which will help lower real long-term interest rates."

Japan has been suffering from a classic "liquidity
trap": while an exorbitant amount of money is available
for lending, companies and individuals are not borrowing
as they try to reorganize their activities. Thus, the
money is bottled up in the banks, idle.

While most people see the move as a sign of government
desperation, it may also help some banks facing shrinking loan demand.

Masaaki Kanno, senior economist at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, is also unconcerned. "Japanese commercial banks are the largest buyers of government bonds," he said, "so there's really no change."

The government is battling to keep its ballooning deficit in check in the face of continuing signs that the economy is addicted to stimulus measures that require more debt.

In a speech to Parliament today, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said getting the economy on its feet would take
precedence over paring the national debt. "Fiscal reform
is important," he said, "but we cannot commit the
mistake of undertaking it while the economy is not firm
and before it is on the path of full-fledged recovery."

Yet highlighting the discord within the government,
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa bemoaned the fact that
the proposed budget would push government debts to 645
trillion yen, or $6.15 trillion.

Economic prospects are not bright. The Japan Center for
Research estimates that G.D.P. fell by 1.6 percent in
the latest quarter, suggesting that the government will
have trouble meeting its target for 0.6 percent growth
this year.

Hiroyuki Inoue, the center's senior economist, said the
figures demonstrated that when government public-works
outlays end, the economy falls right back into the
doldrums. "After the effects of government spending
programs faded last summer," he said, "the economy
slipped back to the level it hit in 1998."

He expects the situation to change as the latest stimulus package starts kicking in. But the center's figures still suggest that the economy is far from able to sustain itself, even though Mr. Obuchi promised today that there would be no new spending beyond the record $810.8 billion budget he has proposed.

The Finance Ministry spokesman said the decision to borrow from banks rather than float bonds was merely an effort to segregate the funds, which will go into a special account for local governments.

He said it had nothing to do with the government's ability to raise money, an assertion confirmed by two recent bond auctions.

But that makes the plan even more puzzling. Economists
speculate that the government is wary of issuing more
bonds than it has to, fearful of jeopardizing any
recovery by pushing long-term rates higher. "They're
afraid of upsetting the bond market," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.

The government also wants to avoid drawing additional
scrutiny from credit ratings agencies. Many economists
say Moody's Investors Service, which withdrew its triple-A rating of Japan's sovereign debt last year, is poised to downgrade its assessment even more later this
year. Standard & Poor's, though, recently reaffirmed its
triple-A rating.

The ministry spokesman said the new plan was nothing
more than a response to the fact that traditional sources of financing have fallen short. The government has traditionally been able to tap the 253 trillion yen postal savings system, but many 10-year deposits will mature soon, leading many economists to predict that money will flow out of the system in search of higher returns. The post office in Japan is the de facto largest bank in the country.

The spokesman stressed, however, that the outflow should
dwindle after two years, at which point the government
might be able to dip into it again.

Similarly, Mr. Koll noted that the post office took in
1.1 trillion yen in new deposits last month, suggesting
that Japan's ever-so-cautious investors may prefer earning 0.28 percent over 10 years to risking their life savings in the market.

The decline in tax revenues coupled with a decreasing
ability to tap the postal savings system left the
government with a gaping $76 billion hole when it came time to give local governments their share. "Can they keep spending money to cover the deficits of the local
governments and in the pension system?" Mr. Asher asked.
"If the answer is no, there's going to be a crisis."

The government has resorted to direct borrowing at least
once before, to cover shortfalls in a special account for national forestry projects. But the account for local government is different, said Kunji Okue, an
economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.

"Borrowings for national forestry projects are used to
manage and cultivate national forests and parks and can
thus be viewed as an investment expense," Mr. Okue wrote
in a recent report.

Also, he noted, the amount borrowed for the forestry
account was far smaller. "This is the first time since the end of World War II that Japan has undertaken large-scale direct borrowing to cover recurring expenses," he said.

The last time the United States resorted to a similar
move was in 1893, when J. P. Morgan provided gold to help the Treasury.

C Man,
Now that the Euro has become even more competitive with the dollar, the US trade deficit is going to literally explode! And this is on top of a cascading dollar system that is forcing the Fed to pump money! And now Britain is running straight for EU membership with all that implies for the US dollar system. You tell me if this doesn't mean they are managing a gold banking crisis with their sales. If they join before a gold market failure, then "England in Euroland" will be the end of dollar gold banking as we know it! Believe it! Here is a real shocker:

Blair Accused Of Planning Euro-Superstate

Conservative leader William Hague says Tony Blair and Brussels bureaucrats are pushing ahead with plans to create a European super state. Mr Hague argued that European Commission proposals published this week could lead to further EU integration, and a limiting of member states' right to use their national veto.

But Mr Hague rejected Mr Blair's accusation that the Tories wanted to quit Europe. Mr Hague told the Council of Europe's European Democrat Group that the EC's proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference later this year let slip its integrationist ambitions.
He said :"They are pushing for a European Union with its own government, its own army, its own taxes, its own foreign policy, its own criminal justice system, its own constitution, as well as its own currency - in other words, a single European state.
"The submission is an integrationist wish-list - the blueprint for a single European state." Mr Hague said the EC wanted to expand the use of majority voting to push through policies which a minority of countries did not back. He said: "The national veto would be abolished in areas such as aspects of social security, social policy, industrial and transport policy, financial regulation and the spending of the multi-million pound structural and cohesion funds." The blueprint was not an "isolated document," the conservative leader warned.
He added: "It comes alongside moves to build a European defence capability independent of Nato, and a common foreign and security policy which the EU's High Representative concerned calls the 'integration project for the next decade'."

Part 1

Hello everyone,
Finally I have some time. Permafrost has come into this forum and made a few posts that need review by us all. I'll present my case against his position as in a court with all of our forum members as the jury.

Hello Permafrost,
Nice to see you today as we stand before the court of public opinion. Now we can feel the pressure many of my friends feel before voters (smile).

ALL: What we have here is a person walking into our convention where FOA has been offering his reasons for gold for a year,,,,,,,,,then Mr. Frost stands up and says ""he's (FOA) telling you to buy Euros"!

He comes in on (12/24/99; 2:31:01MDT - Msg ID:21594),,,,,,,,'saying
--------Hailing from a "Third World Country"! Mes Compliments to you all! Dear Forum particants, I have stumbled upon this Shoe Box while shuffling my cyber feet to locate the LBME site. After a few weeks of perusing the postings, especially those by the Elders----------------

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and suddenly he is an expert on my position?? From a person that has read for a "few weeks" and is so new he just found the LBMA web site!!

(Your Honour: this line of reasoning goes to "experience credibility" in the affairs of the modern information markets.)

My Position:

I state this from the beginning: no one can claim an understanding of a book if they read and use only the last chapter for reference. This is essentially what Mr. Frost has done. By design of purpose or by mental accident he has stated my position out of context and continues to do so.
Before me, Another proclaimed that gold was the only wealth investment Westerners could count on in the long term. Not stocks, not bonds, not currencies or paper gold derivatives. Using hundreds of posts he offered bits and pieces of the puzzle he referred to as the "New Gold
Market". Time and time again, he pointed out the relationship between oil, gold and currencies as they were maneuvered by the political wills of the world. Of course, just like you, me and everyone that reads this forum, he holds other investments. Yes, all the usual paper items traded in this modern world along with the other hard things. Like property, businesses and personal belongings.
Still, the thrust of his logic was "always" that the dollar would fall and gold would rise! His reason dictated that one could extend their wealth, safely through this coming transition by holding a large position of physical gold.
Myself, I have also produced hundreds of posts on this forum,,,,,and they all presented the "logic" and "reasons" for holding gold. Yes, some of them said that the Euro will eventually be strong. But, always the "Euro Event" in our time was viewed as the main catalyst that would propel the dollar down and gold up.

Mr. Frost; you must present a series of my thoughts that in a chain of reason conclude what you present as true. Otherwise your posts are false and without credibility. Show us where my "chain of thought" or "logic in progression" has directed one to invest in Euros without gold or in Euros and
not gold. If you cannot demonstrate this reasoning, your contentions are worthless for consideration and must be discarded.

My thrust and feelings for gold as stated in from hundreds of posts, are most clearly stated in the end of FOA (12/28/99; 8:34:38MDT - Msg ID:21734):

Gold, the only investment needed for the next thousand years


Onward:

In Mr. Frost's post of (12/29/99; 7:40:27MDT - Msg ID:21773),,,,,,he replies to Cavan Man
---------I find your train of thought quite pragmatic for the most part. But I personally don't think we'll have a "fix" to our dollar-based monetary systemic problem. That would be like trying to cure the disease...I think it'll be a wake up in the morning into a new world sort of cathartic affair. For gold and finance are mutually exclusive. ------------------

ALL: This is in part something I completely agree with. Our views part ways in that I see the Euro eventually taking over the dollar's reserve function. Reducing the dollar to a much lower standard in world affairs. For this transition I proclaim that "Western Investors" buy mostly gold. But, knowing that everyone holds other assets, we should try to denominate those (other) holdings in Euros if possible. So, just like he says (Mr. Frost) ------I don't think we'll have a "fix" to our dollar based monetary systemic problem ---.

FOA Msg ID: 21734
Dear Sir, Based on your logic, two outcomes are possible.
1) If you're right and we are witnessing the re-monetization of gold than all those that benefited from the fiat money scheme will lose their power. ------------------

Mr. Frost,
Not all of them! Only the ones that did not hedge their power effectively. Surely the Euro will carry some of the same political agendas the dollar currently does. Only, it will be controlled more so by the cross currents evident in the various old world countries. Let's face it, we all need a dollar like currency if our modern economy is going to function. What we don't need is a single reserve currency that precludes any avenue of escape if it hurts other countries. If gold is trading in a free physical market, no one is going to run to gold as a single currency and leave the Euro entirely. Indeed, a free world economy needs and demands a currency that can expand and contract with changing conditions. The curse of the old gold standard was that it didn't allow this latitude and always created a crisis when needs required this flexible money supply. Only
a separate gold market can offer a means to truly measure the success of the money creating treasuries. This is the direction we are heading, for better or worse.

-----------A gold backed and restrained financial system (An oxymoron, in my belief) will simply preclude them from accumulating goods and services against monopoly money -- the source of their power.--------------

Well PF, the power you speak of can also be held through the use of gold itself. Many a king and monarch ruled the land with the effective use of bullion. Your oxymoron is not in the restraint of the monopoly money, rather in the present lack of a free choice between "gold wealth" and "dollar
wealth". The blending of these concepts will create a new power block that must conform to the needs of all.

----------2) If you're not and gold is merely being used as a relatively-untapped "new" source of non-debt-backed dollar creation, than it's a very old game we're playing, indeed. Was not gold itself responsible for one of the greatest INFLATIONARY explosions in History when the Conquistadors "expropriated" Aztec gold and brought it all to Europe to consume (chaseafter) a "limited amount of goods and services"? Colombus turning over in his grave? -------------

PF, During the time of the Conquistadors, we must consider that goods were not being inflated in price, rather gold was being devalued! At the very least gold did not disappear as bank notes do. No, the coming run in gold will be a reflection of the tremendous dollar inflation already in the
system. It's only in the eyes of the Western dollar saver that this price inflation is unwarranted. Again, they are only loosing something they never had. An illusion of wealth on a grand scale.

------QUESTION: Do you know of any emperor (I think you called them 'Grandees' here on this forum) who's willingly abdicated power--Besides God himself?------------

My friend (PF), power belongs to the swift of heart and mind. This world waits for no one as power flows from peoples to peoples. Even the strongest emperor knows to occupy the high ground before the flood. The powerful in tomorrow's future will own gold today. Thank you, FOA
------------------------------------------------------------

ALL:
At the beginning of this post (above) I made the statement: " " Surely the Euro will carry some of the same political agendas the dollar currently does. " " .
This item alone is proof of my opinion of this new digital currency. It will be little more than a digital contract item of settlement,,,,,,a fiat currency in competition with the dollar for reserve use. It's advantage is obvious ,,,,,,,,, it's new! History has shown that every currency system "at least" has it's time on stage,,,,,,,and they always start out with low debt and a dearth of holders. For this reason alone it will function for at least a while. Do I say "hold only Euros and no gold"? Of course not! Who here could read such a position into this given viewpoint?

Further:

Again he addresses me in a civil manner as below:

To the court: The gentleman posts in a civil tone only to give way to a caustic format later. For what purpose does one so obviously break the social rules of forum conduct?

PERMAFROST (1/3/00; 2:31:57MDT - Msg ID:22103)
FOA Msg ID: 21859 Part 1
Dear Sir, Thanks for your response.
--------You are advocating a global financial system predicated on the peaceful and mutually-beneficial "concubinage" of gold and the "new girl in town" fiat money the Euro which you unwarrantedly presume to be relatively more "chaste" than the Old Whore, the US dollar, ONLY
because it is not "backed" by as much debt as the dollar, and its "lovers" (the EU Central Bankers,the Rothschilds?; an assorted variety of Illuminati and various other power brokers playing both sides [the sheeple?] against the middle [more sheeple]) tip their hat at gold without solemnly
declaring their allegiance at sovereign money, PM etc. ------------------

No Mr. Frost;
I don't advocate that. I think this is your perception of future events. This transition will not be "peaceful" in any way. Any time one large official faction (Dollar/IMF group) has it's money power replaced by a new official faction (Euro / BIS), it's never peaceful and not without significant loss of wealth by some of the players. I add that both little and big players get hurt when these events
happen. Usually, it's the little "uninformed" players that lose the most. Your observation that people are "sheeple" comes as they step in front of a train with no breaks. Then
you tell the world that "someone" is out to get them. My experience is that the average investor is much more intelligent than that and they can do a good job of "moving" off the tracks if it's pointed out to them that a train is coming. The dollar is giving up it's reign as a reserve currency, not "only" because it has so much debt. It's
being replaced because it's inflation (total money supply, dollar derivatives supply, dollar debt supply and the official liabilities foreign nations hold as reserves supply) has discounted so much future real US production, at a constant exchange rate, that it is losing the ability to function as a reserve currency. Every currency on earth has one day come to this end. We call it a "fiat money's
timeline". At this point the users of this money begin to either "deflate it's supply" through debt and payment default, or the they devalue it by bidding up the value of real goods (price inflation). Once either of these begin, the money function of that reserve currency declines. Further, one will find that deflation is only a choice if no other official world currency is available to run to. World citizens vote with their feet at this point and greatly discount unpayable debt thus causing said deflation.
Inflation is the choice when people can "refinance" into another currency media. Leaving the old to contend with an ever increasing velocity of the useless money supply. This is the fate that waits the dollar.
Is this some structure brought about by a New World Order? If you want to see it this way, then remember the world has been doing this from creation. I only add, why bother to put the "New" on it? Let's just call it "Next World Order"! Besides, it's only one peoples as a nation group (EURO/BIS) trying to protect their wealth because another nation group of peoples (Dollar/IMF) borrowed more that they could ever pay back! Still, I read this New World Order faction (NWOF) as loudly declaring the Euro as a fraud, yet they (NWOF) are hip deep the dollar assets
of a country that "defaulted on it's gold delivery. Twice! Then they (NWOF) yell because no one is creating a new gold or gold backed currency. Why do that? So we can be defaulted again by the "NEXT World Order"?
-----------------------

ALL: Later on Mr. Frost tries to paint a picture that I did not hold this logic. His future contention that all the "boys in control" are in the same club and the Euro is but another dollar. My chain of reasoning demonstrates how his logic is flawed. The very fact that we find "tribes" and
"sides" on this forum speaks volumes about human interaction. In like kind, world power brokers also form "tribes" as they jockey for position in world affairs. Is this not plainly obvious to all of us? They even fight among themselves as witnessed in the Euroland struggles. But this is no different than the US political fights. Still, we all band together in larger groups when it comes to world
affairs. Financial power is no different. Sure, they all hate gold, but they will embrace it if it gives them an advantage in currency warfare.

In my next reply to his several part post, I offer the logic and reasoning behind the dollars position. Why it is managed today in a defensive posture. It presents it's weak link from where the Euro/BIS faction can attack.
------------------------------------
-----------------------------------
You write:
-----------------
This fiat money is necessary, you say, because it will allow management [manipuation] of the economy without suffering the deleterious side effects that a rigid gold standard has saddled us with in the past. Would you care to draw for the benefit of the forum the the philosophical line that
separates you from, say, an Alan Greenspan, as per the gold/fiat money relationship? do we not have TODAY a fully-floating POG alongside the dollar? What shall we gain in re-baptizing fiat money with a different name, i.e., the Euro? except the prolongation of the Game? IF gold IS
money than nothing else is. Disagree?
--------------------------

No PM;
We don't have a fully floating price of gold today. This is the illusion (paper gold) that has many people (such as yourself) locked into a narrow view. Mr. Greenspan has always seen the gold money relationship from a US dollar perspective and holding the US as the only dominating
financial power. He knows that the dollar could never retain it's position if gold became a "separate settlement currency" through a true world free physical market. All of the dollar price inflation that is currently locked into the present dollar supply inflation would present itself. Dollar reserves held world wide would become useless unless they could be used to buy real US goods (at a non inflated price).
Truly, Mr. G. only sees gold from a Washington view and even that must be locked in the cellar. He manages a system built by others and must use the tools this system allows. The present paper gold market is as much a function of the dollar value as interest rates and it is controlled as such.
Today, gold is money, I agree! But, it is not and never can be a fluctuating (in supply) digital money of high speed settlement. For it to work it's past magic in this modern world, it must trade in physical form without derivative use. It will.

Capitalism, this familiar but insidious term really stands for the wilful confusion of a descripitive proposition [that private property exists] with a PRESCRIPTIVE one [that private property and the wealth that can be generated from it is GO(O)D]. -------------------

No PM,
not at all.
This is the standard (higher level) teachings in modern Western education. History proves that "real private property" has and always has been both wealth and a purchasing power medium (money). Through the best of times and the worst of times, in war and peace, people have always had private property. Even in Russia of old, they had to allow people their things. Even if these positions weren't recorded "officially". A universal truth is that no form of official ruler-ship can function unless people have some private wealth. Never has worked for even a short time and never will. Further, generating more wealth from private property (owned wealth)is only good if one can overcome the "RISK" that comes with it. This is nothing new to most of the world. It's just a different concept for modern Western man.

You write:
---------------
It's a logical fallacy that doesn't survive the glare of critical analysis. Omit the adjective "private" from the premise and what you end up with is the other side of the coin, or communism. Both systems are basically worship of materialism and humanistic (man is the measure of the universe) propaganda. Now, whereas communism theoretically aims at generating its "GOD", or 'goods and services' in economic parlance, via the sweat and toil of its fellow gods (the proletariat), capitalism is predicated on CONSTANT INSTABILITY [the insidious rhetoric of the bankers
notwithstanding] of the prices of these very goods and services, the [managed] fluctuations of which allow the people Greenspan works for to earn wealth they did not work for. -----------------

As to even the 'emperor running to higher ground when he sees the flood coming'--if he were to do so, he'd be emperor no more for what makes an emperor an emperor is the "land" he rules.

To die an emperor is perhaps preferable than to live as a normal human being for some...You?

You are doing this willingly because the content of your postings display articulate intelligence and considerable knowledge. The only conclusion I can deduce from these FACTS are that you are either trying to surreptitiously mislead your following or simply making an [---] of yourself.
Unfortunate in both cases.
--------------------------------

ALL: Some chain of logic? One would think he would respond to all the previous discussion ,,,,, and do so in a manner that spells out his position. Instead he uses the old ---I can't present my views in a way that proves me right so I'll tell everyone that you're an (---)!

Then he goes on:

------------------------
TO THE FORUM PARTICIPANTS:
Your fawning and obseqious behaviour towards the local gurus places you in the same ship [the Titanic?] as the sheeple you frown upon.I've been reading this forum for a month; thence follow my observations for those who care to read them:
-----------------------

ALL: Again I say, "What a bunch of garbage!!" He admits that he's been reading the group for a month,,,,,,no less,,,,,,,,and has us all pegged. And later on says that I am talking down to everyone!!

Then he goes on:

-----------------------------
1) Only A=A. If gold=A then NOTHING ELSE equals A. Period. No Euros, dollars, dinars or
liras.
2) Positing premise #1 to be true, all those here claiming that the Euro constitutes the lifeboat off of
the Titanic [the dollar] are LYING, because YOU know that they know better!
3) Now I ask YOU who previously considered yourselves to be so well informed; WHY would they do such a thing? Do they have a hidden agenda or are they plain you-know- what?
When they disparage one fiat money [the dollar] and sing the praises of another [the Euro] they are talking from both sides of their respective mouths. Sheer dishonesty!
---------------------------

ALL: Again I say "What a bunch of garbage!!" You have all just read our (FOA/A) position as given. Did anyone feel "arm twisting" ,,,, or "mind control",,,,,or a "hidden agenda"? I ask, where is his logic chain,,,,,,,his political analysis ,,,, his reasoning. Does he just give "predictions" based on his perceptions without laying the ground work of how political logic would bring his events about?

Mr. Frost says (part of his post) in (1/13/00; 6:59:28MDT - Msg ID:22822)----------Even assuming Aristotle's words were written in stone, YOU are still confusing an alleged (by Ari) RESULT with an actual CAUSE of that result, or fact (irrationally assumed by the lot of them) that never was the case: THE DOLLAR WAS NEVER PEGGED TO OIL!--------------
------------

ALL: But he never offers his reasoning as to why! Nothing! Deep stuff, huh! Big help to the forum as a team effort! Here is another of his team effort-----------(1/13/00; 7:15:04MDT - Msg ID:22824)---------You're right Steve; nothing wrong with being friends and sharing thoughts. But I
sensed a whiff of insipid and insidious tendencies and aired out the room. See? now we got fresh air, and that's good as well.----------------

---------------------
ALL: finally we get some analysis in 22826 and 22875, but it's again mostly rebutting other posters.
He attacks me (and others) with innuendoes and then states the following---------(1/18/00; 2:39:41MDT - Msg ID:23093)-------RossL; and Forum also To condemn someone in public without elaborating evidence or at least an argument is not a sensible thing to do. IMHO, I am simply reacting to what I perceive as being the promulgation of half-truths and wilful creation of confusion and intellectual miasma on this forum.------------------------------------

ALL: "What a bunch of garbage!" ,,,,,,and "What an incredible contradiction!"
He is "simply reacting to what I (he) perceived"-----and after only reading the discussion for a month or so. Does
"his perception" give him the right to step all over other participants?
--------------------

Mr. Frost says in --------(1/18/00; 8:28:03MDT - Msg ID:23104)------------------Mr. Peter Asher; With all due respect, sir, I never stoop to calling people names like your camp has done re Msg. ID 23098 by FOA.FOA; Strange...I have the nagging feeling that what you wrote there (Msg. 23098) hurt YOUR credibility more than it did anything else. For God's sake man, you actually called me a nut! Was
that really warranted? Does THAT fit the guidelines?
-------------

ALL: "What a bunch of garbage!" He just said that we offer ----half-truths and willful creation of confusion and intellectual miasma on this forum------,,,,,,,,and then says he never insults anyone!

Then admits that in my Msg. 23098 he was the nut referred to. Read my post,,,,,I never referred to him. "What a bunch of ?"
---------------

And Further:

He continues his posting with----(01/20/2000; 06:13:29MDT - Msg ID:23242)----As for your mentor, FOA, he states that #23197: "In none of our meetings have we heard where a fear was expressed that the governments will lose control of digital currencies and (give it) back to gold. That is simply not going to happen, no matter how severe a down turn the loss of the American dollar system creates. Believe it."
beesting, why should we believe your mentor? This guy is talking about NOT giving control back togold which YOU YOURSELF equate with SOVEREIGNTY. He wants gold bridled and the Eurobewinged to monetary heaven and you want to put him in the HOF?----------------

ALL: did anyone read my entire post and receive it in the full context of what I presented today? His perception of what I said is garbage,,,,pure and simple. Then he goes on in the same post
----------This, the banker community, of which I suspect FOA to be a member of as evinced in his own allusions to be speaking down to us from "official" spheres, are trying to hide from us by advertising the Euro as the one lifeboat off of the dollar-Titanic.-------------

Again, after all this guy says about our discussion, I am accused of this trash!

There is more------(01/21/2000; 02:39:57MDT - Msg ID:23334)----------BEESTING: FOA has discredited HIMSELF. Just as you yourself did by standing by a man who's betrayed you.----

ALL: What was that ????,,,, where did that come from? Why am I standing on the same stage and attempting to add to this convention while this "!!!" is saying anything that comes to mind?
--------------------

Now I'm told (by a friend) who he is
--------(1/28/2000; 4:37:35MDT - Msg D:23715)--------Someone was asking Leigh if I was TZADEAK and had any good leads that would presumably help him/her make a buck or two. Well; here's my "predictions" for 'you'...-------------

---------------------
Well I have to thank my good friends for tracking much of the gold talk on the web. They are the ones that saved all these posts and pointed out that this PERMAFROST is indeed of the same mold as TZADEAK that posts on Kitco. Today, he and Disney go round and round using several handles (go follow it past and present and you will understand). This is the same type of guy (or is he the same?) that came over here using the Mello88 handle and NewGold. He has always tried to claim that he is Another or had Another's ideas or some other ridiculous crap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and does it
in a totally caustic fashion. His postings are well documented (PHinLA you witnessed his incredible conversations)and Another would never share a stage with ANY SUCH FOOL or the Lurking Gold Bug idiot (ON k),,,,,,,
once he realized their tactics.
My writing is a reflection of him (Another) when he's not posting and I must honour his directions. I said I would walk off this stage if there kind were allowed here. It
was bad enough to hear Stranger literally stomp me into the ground, then promote himself as a professional pillar of the community,,,,,apologize and return. But, no amount of camaraderie is worth being associated on stage with this other nut.

Sorry Michael. This decision was made for me. From time to time I'll send in something for you to post in another area (off the forum) if you will allow (OR WANT). But this is where I MUST draw the line. This is final, good luck all.

Changes
Some changes I was asked to make.

Hello all,
The last post (s) by Rainman only underscored the point Another made to me earlier. His (Another's) message is so strong and political that it will always draw out "verbal assassins" in an effort to destroy the concepts (MK understands this and communicated it to me also). Especially as they (events) start to really confirm this new direction. Some of these (forum) disruptions are deliberate and some are due to mental dysfunction, but all of them divert most people from fully grasping the trail in the context given. I don't think everyone fully realizes just how much of an
impact these "Thoughts" (as political wills force the issue) will have on the international assets and business plans of major people. Some of them will argue against these viewpoints as if all their wealth depended upon it. Indeed, it just may!

Some time ago (many years), he privately planted these Thoughts very deep in the minds of a few. Only recently were these items produced on the Web for all to see. It was done in a way that did not betray things gained in confidence, but still made people see the world as others did. Another withdrew when the attacks (he knew would come), arrived. I wanted to continue on in a "narrative" fashion that would spell out these changes (events) more clearly as they occurred. As an American, I knew that most "Western Thinkers" would not ,did not and will not grasp these
political changes until they were well underway, or worse. Even then, every attempt will be made by special interest groups to show events in a different (more dollar friendly) light. Virtually assuring a stampede once the real bell is rung.

Truly, other major changes in world affairs are coming. Once they are visible, I believe Another will return and comment. Again, he does not write to engage people, he writes to place other minds "in the pipeline of political thoughts and directions". I truly think it has more to do with ethics and honour than the love of man. This may be a harsh observation on my part, but some cultures (as well as individual standards) require this.

So:
My posting here as FOA has attracted to much of the same caustic attacks that he walks right through. In reality, he is thick skinned as one could imagine such a person to be. As one of you posted an "A" item earlier, "these attacks are as boys having words with the wind, yet a strong wind has no ears" (or something like that). But, as the "thin skinned Westerner" I am, I do a poor job of representing his thoughts the way it was done before. After Permafrost continued his mindless comments, I was "asked" to no longer post as FOA in a give and take forum setting. Even
though I offered extended reasoning, it was never addressed in a clean logical fashion. The Rainman item only underscored this. But (if MK will allow), I will continue (as FOA) the "Gold trail Hikes" in posted letter form somewhere else on the USAGOLD site. We can still address many of the forum discussion items as deemed necessary. Yet, it will be done more in a letter format. If I am to post again on the forum (sparingly), I must use a different handle and debate the issues as myself, rather than represent the Thoughts of Another. This removes me from a conflict most of you did not know existed.

Also:

To everyone that wrote here in support of these writings, I reply with a thanks from a true heart. I accept this knowing that your words are also for all the other fine persons that post here.
MK, you are the Hollywood producer and director of this drama. A film being shown around the world for all to see. It's your call my friend?

Thanks FOA

PH in LA, Cavan Man, and ALL,
I'm waiting on some possible new structural changes to this website. If it works out it will be very interesting. Also, I will receive a new handle for this forum and for the first time post representing myself only (not anyone else). Give it some time, this will all work out very well.


Only market events can change the opinions of "hard" gold bugs that are looking too much into the past for guidance. No amount of human logic or our discussion will sway them to view the future in a different context. Many of them only see the here and now plus 3 steps in front of them.

Later, god willing, all of us will "walk the gold trail" as a group (FOA included) with an eye on the future, not the past.

Thanks all,,,for your many comments ,,,,,, I'm taking this time to complete several projects. Will
return later (a number of days).

The Gold Trails
Thank you Aristotle!
A fine work that's worth a long study, my friend.

ALL:
Many writers today offer nothing less than a philippic discourse about the flaws in today's fiat systems. Always looking backwards, they are lost to grasp how what was considered "hard money policies then",,, "eventually failed then",,, as these same interacted within the economy. Truly, a hard financial structure trying to blend with a soft, flexible "human nature". In a larger degree, how much more could it not work in today's modern world. Once implemented today, these same policies would again "crash and burn" in response to the demands from "real people" living a "real life ".

Aristotle, your five part series is trechantly written and offers readers a glimpse into a future that must be. Will be!

My thoughts on a deep subject:

If the modern banking system has mislead us at all, it mislead by supporting a view that our wealth, our things, were not money. They implied that "paper settlement money" was our real wealth and only it could be as such. Truly, as we walk and breathe, human's things have always existed as both money and wealth. Side by side by side they walked with us in our financial life, in both modern and past context. Yet, in our modern "Western World" of thought, the largest portion of one's personal asset holdings now reside in the form of "paper money". Worse, the majority in it's "contract derivatives" forms. Gold included.

No longer do we hold our greatest portions in real forms that transcends the peaks and valleys of fiat money value ,,,, a variable fiat money system that our "changeable nature" demands. No, we option to ignore the true purpose of this paper money system and cast the entirety of our resources into it. Never stopping to understand that this money is but an "economic need" "to process a trade". Not an "economic product" and therefore wealth itself.

Through out recent time, fiat money has responded well to human nature, flowing like a river as it expands and contracts to our wants and desires to buy and sell things. From drought to flood it is the channel of our trading system, as it moved the "end product water" that flows within it's wide banks.

Today we use the remains of this dying "dollar settlement system". It continues a natural death, as society struggles to use a currency that can no longer represent our financial structure. A changing structure in a world that marches on. The dollar's debt load has aged it and brought it to the end of it's time line.

Only today, the end of this "time line" will find many holding their wealth in this same system, for a purpose it should never have been intended to perform. That being, to represent one's life long accumulation of real wealth as their money wealth things. Most will understand the impact of this well after the fact as we are indeed in transition to yet another paper system. One we must have, requested and will use. Just as everyone used the old one to their own private advantage, we will indeed grasp the next one. Just as you point out Aristotle, fiat exists more so because it does "what societies economic function wants", not because it's a function of "what society is forced to do"! Still, some will bark against this in a effort to stop people from following human destiny. Fortunately, relative to our lifetimes the world evolves quickly, with or without our agreement.

In this period however, we will return back in time much further than many can see. This time gold will be pulled away from it's strained attachment with "fiat contracts of currency" and again take it's place as the ages old "wealth money holding" it always was. It will occupy it's rightful place on the shelf with all our other "wealth things". And here it will, "for the first time in modern context" show it's true value in relation to modern paper settlement money. A value no one today will believe!

Should one risk financial assets based on this series (Aristotle's) alone? Never! On the contrary, no one should believe what he has written. Rather, we as a society should "study" his fine work and seek to understand it's meaning. Once fully understood, I think most would then agree with it's inevitable outcome. Indeed, a "free gold market", based only on physical holdings would impact the world economic system unlike anything seen before it. And Yes, it's impact on the relative value of gold will make that metal the monetary wealth investment for the next thousand years!

This my friends is why so many today, "Walk In The Footsteps Of Giants". They walk a trail that takes them further and further from derivatives of gold and the present currency it's (gold) priced in.

From Yesterday, through Today and onward into Tomorrow" ,,,,, we say buy Physical Gold for your future ,,,,,,, doing so will write your personal history in the palm of your hand!

"Soon, we will all hike the "Gold Trails" and see all there is to see ,,,,,,, over the mountains and through the valleys ,,,,,,, across rivers and plains ,,,, looking near and far as we stop along the way ,,,,,,, Truly, we will view the value of gold as modern mankind has never seen it before ,,,,, join in, it will be a journey in life, that's well worth taking.

thank you again Aristotle ,,, Trail Guide

It begins! -----* Executive Summary--an Outline of Observations *-----
The harsh slap of reality and the soothing touch of Gold:

*** Any monetary system that attempts to coin gold, or otherwise use gold as currency will naturally give rise to banks--for security and quality assurance, if for no other reason.

*** History reveals time and time again that this seemingly "perfect" gold-only system naturally evolves into fractional-reserve lending because it is what the people want.
((People want to consume or to own now that which they have not yet saved enough to purchase outright. They are willing to mortgage their future productivity in order to have their house today--they seek sources of loans. Meanwhile, those that already have a quantity of money are seen to seek a source of income from their wealth...and banks come to be actively sought and employed by both sides to act as the middleman.))

*** While lending depositors' money, the efficiency of banking to reallocate fungible funds allows many people to behave as though they all are owners of (have access to) the same original money on deposit.
((The bank uses its available, unlent funds to satisfy any depositors' requests for withdrawals rather than reminding them that the funds are temporarily unavailable--because in order to earn interest, the bank lent the money out, as per their agreement.))

*** The artificial increase in the money supply erodes its per-unit purchasing power.

*** A growing economy (complete with rising prices from a "softer" currency) raises the customers' demands upon the banker's art of money creation, widening the gulf between here and reality...between the vast amount of banking credit and the small original amount of real wealth-money upon which it was all built.

*** Because coin and bank-credit circulate as equivalent, interchangeable currency, the value the currency-unit regardless of form (Gold coin or paper) falls in accord with the growing supply of bank-credit.
((The many accounts filled with bank-credit "money" gives rise to the wealth-effect built upon the perception of abundant funds. This pressures prices and puts the effective purchasing power of the currency-unit severely out of balance with the proper and natural purchasing power that should otherwise be enjoyed separately by the small quantity of real Gold on hand. In practice, this renders the metal used in the under-valued coins into little more than an artifact of "the good ol' days when things were cheaper."))

*** When the value of the coin comes to be viewed as a simple representation of the abundant currency and fails to reflect the value of its metal, it might as well be made out of anything at that point.
((If a paper dollar can circulate at par with a gold dollar, and the purchasing power of both is dictated by the supply of paper dollars, then why incur the expense of minting coins out of Gold? If simple durability is desired, then copper or nickel would certainly be capable to represent the currency's value every bit as well as the paper does. Therefore, avoiding the expense of Gold in the production of currency for circulation would easily be seen to be an act of prudence, whether the value involved is 1¢ or 100 dollars.))

*** The concept of money gradually loses its original meaning and its ties to real wealth; it comes to be built upon the thin ice of confidence and good loan performance of the banking system.

*** Fixed gold convertibility of the currency on account looms large as a threat to the banking system.
((Keep in mind that it is through natural human activity that banking evolves into an important system for much of society, built by a population that has come to depend heavily upon it. Therefore, a stage will always arrive in which the fixed Gold convertibility of the circulating currency will be purposefully abandoned. It is done to preserve "lifestyle as we know it" in the eyes of those people living at such a stage in a currency time line.))

*** What then is the role for Gold? Gold qualifies as the only TRUE money. Among the many national currencies, only Gold fills the three important monetary criteria: store of value; medium of exchange; and unit of account. Gold, therefore, remains the ultimate king of them all and subject to none...as long as it isn't attached in any official capacity to the fate or fortune of any one of them. Therefore, the monetary system architecture must be such that Governments find no temptation; they are unable to derive any benefit to their own situation through any efforts to "keep a lid" on Gold.

*** Gold must be set free to float, seeking its proper value among the world of circulating currencies; preserved as a unique currency that may NOT be lent (because lending effectively causes a perceived increase in its supply and decrease in its purchasing power, as outlined above.) Gold must only be bought and sold outright, and must remain free of the attachments of any and all financial derivatives.

*** All people, regardless of nationality, must be free to exchange their national currency for Gold at prices established by an open physical Gold market.
((As I've said before, any system in which a person is denied the liberty to own Gold as a form of savings is both financially and morally bankrupt.))

How will this work, you ask?
*** Gresham's law predicts that the world's supreme currency, Gold, will not actually circulate in the conventional sense. Gold will be saved (and will appreciate in value without lending/leasing it out for interest,) while national fiat currencies will circulate under the needs of the economy. It is these national fiat currencies that will continue to satisfy the demand of borrowers for loans. National fiat currencies will also serve as the means to satisfy the various governments' unrestrainable inclinations to "manage" their economies to the extent that they are able. They, too, will hold Gold in savings (reserves) for the same reason we do.

The supporting chapters are to follow in this commentary--"Building the Perfect System by Capitalizing on Gresham's Law"

Aristotle (2/7/2000; 8:10:15MDT - Msg ID:24593)
Building the Perfect System by Capitalizing on Gresham's Law
At first cut, people fall into one of two categories: 1) those who recognize the value of an honest monetary system built upon Gold, and 2) those who have not yet given any serious thought to the matter. Proceeding with the small but special population that belong to the first category, my own experience has revealed them to be inclined toward idealism. Good people, to be sure--I wish we were all that way! But while their general awareness of what makes for a more perfect world should be providing them with fuel for an enjoyable life, instead, this level of idealism often blinds many of them to any shades of gray--and there is little comfort living in a strictly black-or-white world. I write this with hope in the off-chance that it may help provide a source of comfort to this small group of idealists, offering them some subtle shades of gray that won't completely undermine their idealistic integrity.

While reaching out to my idealistic friends, I also hope to present a "roadmap of thought" for that larger, all-important population which falls into the second category mentioned above --those that have not tapped into a more thoughtful, enjoyable life which I have seen to be the general hallmark of my few Gold-minded friends (the ones who have themselves avoided the extremist idealistic trappings.) Why do I call this second category the "all-important" population? Because the Many do indeed dictate the terms under which the Few must also live. I must, therefore, grudgingly devote sufficient attention in this commentary to ensure some of the idealistic readers can see this important "shade of gray" regarding majority rule. It is my hope that they will then be prepared to pragmatically accept the terms/constraints under which this *perfect monetary system* must be designed.

In this commentary I shall attempt to clearly lay out what I feel this "perfect" monetary system to be--the perfect system for a consistently imperfect world, that is. I am not so bold as to think that the world of human ambition and disposition is something that can be altered to suit the perfection of our preferred (Gold coin) currency's characteristics--especially the limitations (fiscal austerity) it imposes on its users, the population at large. I therefore resolve myself (and hope you do, also) to the humble thought that our currency system as a whole might be artfully developed into a state of harmony with the world in which we do live. The present system, and all failures before it, have been as square pegs in round holes. With the system to be described, I hope to avoid any system that lends itself to the repetition of past abuses and failures.

The Stage Has Been Set; Let the Play Begin...

Those familiar with the popular discussions of monetary thought will recognize the common plea of the idealistic Gold advocate: calling for a return to a 100% fully "backed" and convertible Gold standard currency system. (As if that were somehow the magic pill to cure all that ails us.) The solution is not so simple, and to believe so is tragically naive black-and-white thought. For confirmation of this, look to our past where you will surely see a familiar world, populated with people that were motivated by the same thoughts that motivate us today. In "their" world (fundamentally the same as ours) we have already had a convertible Gold Standard, but, in fact, history reveals that it did not work. Or maybe more correctly stated, modern times reveal that it did not SURVIVE. To be sure, any conceivable system might be seen to work well for a limited span of time--and indeed, history paints a vivid landscape populated by many currency creatures of various lifespans--but true success is determined by who remains to answer the daily roll call. HOWEVER, from where we sit we can gain important wisdom in the observation that, despite the overthrow of the Gold Standard regime, Gold remains an unparalleled reserve asset; carefully weighed, numbered, cataloged, and stacked, resting well-guarded within central bank vaults throughout the world--unmatched in financial staying power even as all else fails.

Having acknowledged this history, there is no point in rashly calling for us to repeat the mistakes of our past. The problems that killed a fully-convertible Gold Standard back then are still with us today. But take heart. The problem was not with the Gold itself. The problem was with the Gold Standard's fit with the prevailing banking/financial "System." If we objectively face the cold hard reality, we realize that we can't very well live with the lack of either one. But paradoxically, history shows us that the two cannot sustainably coexist--at least not under the various system-designs tried in the past. In my usage here, the "System" refers simply to the dynamic interaction between a currency and its users within the context of evolving economic demands for development, commerce, and banking. (Even to the extent of self-destruction, the System is notoriously good at giving the people what they want.) It is the subtle changes to that system that I hope to spell out, revealing not only how Gold can survive society's preference for the current self-serving System, but also how the System can tolerate/survive the discipline of Gold. In fact, the diametrically-opposed System will not only survive in the face of Gold, but will actually be made more functionally viable by Gold.

Now that you see what we are in for, it seems appropriate to launch my endeavor with this quote from John Kenneth Galbraith: "Most things in life--automobiles, mistresses, cancer--are important only to those who have them. Money, in contrast, is equally important to those who have it and those who don't. Both, accordingly, have a concern for understanding it. Both should proceed in the full confidence that they can." It is in the spirit of that assurance that the playing field has been made level for a such a Little Leaguer like myself that I shall embark on this attempt at passing along my own view of the monetary system. We are told above that everyone should share a common concern for understanding it. Actual experience reveals that few people can muster a basic tolerance for any meaningful dialog on the subject (money.) To be sure, they can be seen to talk at great length on the various schemes for making more of it, but not a word is to be had on the design of it. For that reason, I am thankful that USAGOLD provides this dedicated roundtable of guests to serve where the general population fails to pursue this line of monetary discussion.

Before I go further, I must confess that the map I see before me for the proper delivery of this presentation reveals a path I nearly fear to tread. (Although this view may not match theirs precisely, I have been encouraged to see that some of these same thoughts have also been touched on by PH in LA, FOA, Solomon Weaver, Journeyman, and ORO, to name a few that come to mind. They are seeing the shades of gray.) As I've already hinted, it will likely go against the grain of thought among the staunchest of Gold advocates. But hopefully my long pro-Gold track record will buy me their indulgence as required to read and absorb the thoughts contained in this post with some remnants of objectivity rather than outright dismissal. Herein lies the thorn: for the reader to have any hope of finding merit in this commentary, he must admit--even if only temporarily--that fiat ("paper") currency (i.e. dollar, euro, peso, yen, etc.) is not "completely worthless"...regardless of the enduring popularity of that notion among Goldhearts. Please bear with me; I'm sure you'll like the ending--even if you've already decided that you don't like this ominous beginning.

It doesn't matter who I am, but...

A brief introduction may be called-for to help you to better understand my position, and thereby evaluate whether or not my own thinking behind this commentary is clouded beyond the best attempt on my part at objectivity. So, who is Aristotle? You will know me better for my actions than from any other detail. I seek to recognize both the benefits and the failings of our existing monetary system, and strive to live life for full enjoyment in accordance with each. As such, you should be made aware that I already live "in tune" with what I am about to describe as the perfect financial system within an imperfect world.

I fully realize that I live in a world of fiat currency. Specifically, mine is a fiat dollar world, though not by my individual choice. It's what the majority wanted and dictated, and it's beyond any of us to deny its existence and credibility. Recognize that, and recognize also its failings, and you are poised to enjoy the best life you can possibly muster. Fail to recognize either side in this day and age, and you are either shorting yourself now (by somehow feeling miserable that paper dollars actually work,) or you will be shorted later (by the inevitable rude discovery that paper dollars weren't quite as good as Gold after all.) I comfortably walk the line of this understanding that dollars work for a purpose, but are not as good as Gold.

I live and work in the real world of fiat currency--there is no point in trying to be circumventive about it. As I work I am paid by others with fiat currency, and I quite happily pay my own bills with fiat currency. I manage my expenses responsibly, and so there is always some fiat currency left over at the end of each month. This I exchange for Gold without fail--to serve as my savings for a later time. No doubt this arrangement will appeal to you in equal measure with your understanding that Gold is the ultimate money; with your sense that it won't/can't be manipulated into extinction; and with your appreciation for the notion that a person, on average, can produce over a lifetime more than he consumes. That final element should also hold true for a group of people (such as a nation,) and no magic of accounting can alter that long-term necessity. Establishing a reliable "accountant" for your life's period of productivity should be enough for any honest person, and Gold serves that role better than any other. I believe those who share this view are among the fortunate few that are ahead of their time--even as the world is rushing to catch up. This will be clearer in time as I explain.

Greed is the one trait that would preclude the successful enjoyment of this present position--a position one step ahead of the following financial evolution. It is a trait that I thankfully find myself lacking--perhaps due to deficiency of imagination. Greed (and arrogance too, I suppose) would entice one to attempt to capitalize on investment leverage and timing of the markets to maximize their gains for the precise day that the world awakens to a new reality. I am far too dull-witted to know the unknowable, so such a strategy of leverage and market timing is prone to unfold as a spectacular failure. Also, I find life to be full enough without the added burden of losing sleep at night worried about such risky investments. Only through the virtue of patience in the understanding that we are for this historically brief time one step ahead of the world will we find in the end that we are among the few who participate in the rewards of a world that suddenly wants to be where we already are. Hopefully this doesn't strike you as the rantings of an irrational star gazer, so with that view of the author let's now move on to the heart of the matter.

Up next: A Test of Your Monetary Maturity...

Aristotle (02/07/00; 10:52:39MDT - Msg ID:24602)
Part Three -- A Test of Your Monetary Maturity
The vagaries of the economic process in the real world make it infeasible to give this matter a comprehensive treatment in this format (nor would I be mentally capable!) so of necessity I will only build upon the most fundamental core principles throughout this commentary. With that caveat out of the way, let's tackle this fiat currency issue right now so that we may sooner breathe a sigh of relief that the bitter pill has been swallowed and that recovery is at hand. How often have we all rallied at one time or another around the Goldhearts' battle cries: "The Fed (or banks in general, or government) simply makes this fiat currency from thin air!" "Fiat money is worthless!" "Fiat currency is the Fed's (or banks', or government's) tool to keep the poor man down." Well, a cold hard reality is that contrary to this line of thinking, while I do indeed fit the description, I certainly have not been kept "down." Have you? Further, and directly to the point, fiat currency isn't "worthless." Have you ever tried to buy anything with it? Did you succeed? I'm sure that you did, so what does that lesson tell you? As a general rule, a person rarely gets "something for nothing." Therefore, the fiat currency must certainly BE "something," and that "something" can't BE worthless.

There is a subtle but important distinction here between being "nothing of value" versus being no *thing* of value. A dollar (or any other fiat currency) is certainly no longer a *thing* although it once was (back in those days of yore when it was defined as a certain weight of Gold.) But it does in fact have value--a value it finds in measure of the success with which it retains the original Concept of value it represented at the time of its origination...at loan creation. This "Concept" is built on a unit foundation of arbitrary size, to be sure; and there can be no doubt that this remains a fundamental weakness for it to serve properly as money (medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.)

Nonetheless, the value in any given currency-unit originates in the terms of the loan contract in which the borrower has promised to repay these units of currency to the lender. And while it seems that these currency units are indiscriminately created out of thin air, each of the many trillions in existence today were created through the joint cooperation of a lender AND a borrower. It takes two to tango. Want to find value in a dollar? Simply track down a new homeowner who toils each workday to pay off his mortgage. (Is he *evil* for borrowing money from "thin air"? More on this later.) It's easy to convince yourself that people will provide goods or services in return for dollars--either because they themselves are in debt and in need of the currency to repay their outstanding debts, or else because they believe with near certainty that these same dollars will be useful to them as a medium of exchange when they encounter somebody else who is burdened with outstanding debts.

A Commonly-stated Problem With Fiat Currency

All in all, the system works about as well as any other manmade thing. Unfortunately, taken as a whole, dollars retain their original value only as reliably as wage-earners and price-setters remain content with past pricing levels. And that is influenced in large part by the perceived ease with which additional dollars may be obtained or loans defaulted on. If a significant number of borrowers will not validate the dollars they borrowed through some manner of equivalent production, then the foundation of its value is eroded. Our own Federal government for example, in its consistent failure to balance its operating budget, has effectively become a significant collective of borrowers that refuse to service their debt--they don't pay back their loans. The government is thereby failing to validate its many trillions of borrowed dollars; and the currency system suffers. The dollar value falls and prices generally rise.

The flip side of the coin regarding money supply is where loans are being paid back more rapidly than new loans are written to keep the outstanding money supply expanding with the prevailing growth rate of the real economy. In this circumstance, increased competition for dollars during this relative contraction in the money supply generally results in an increase to the dollar's value; prices would generally fall. The problem with these expansions and contractions, these inflations and deflations of the currency supply, is that in business and in private life both, people tend to enter into long-term contracts. Because earning power, prices, and wages are subject to this variability over time due to changes based on business cycles and money supply, the act of entering into long-term contracts becomes a mixture of faith and gambling.

As I've stated in an earlier post, people have generally been more comfortable to see monetary supply inflation erode the purchasing power over time. The coping mechanism is to renegotiate for pay-raises--and to face paying higher prices. They are less willing and less happy to renegotiate lower rents and wages and lower prices received for goods resulting from a currency that gains value over time. Due to the prevailing inability of people and businesses to accommodate a currency that gains purchasing power over time, the fallout is harsh. Instead of adjusting the price of contracts downward, the reaction is typically to reduce production and cut back on labor when business profits yield fewer currency units. Economic recessions/depressions are frequently the undesired effect of currency supply that either fails to grow as fast as the economy demands; or worse, a currency supply that actually contracts. This has traditionally been the impetus for a well-intentioned government to attempt various degrees of monetary interventions to bring about more desired economic conditions.

A Solution?

No doubt you are familiar with these problems, and tend to agree with our intrepid forefathers whose anti-banking, anti-fiat currency pronouncements are legendary. In all frankness, these were a handful of exceptional men living at an exceptional time and who accomplished an exceptional feat...the birth of a new Republic. It should not, therefore, come as a surprise to anyone that the opinions and desires so expressed by the likes of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams raised the bar for performance so high that practical performance by their multitudes of mortal descendants could not do but fall woefully short of their lofty vision. (In light of their exceptional life and times they desired perfection---and why not?--they thought they had set the world itself into a state of perfection!) I am not saying that perfection is not a worthwhile goal, but I am saying we must at least be rational about what can and can't be done in a real world populated by...well, just look around you.

Please for give my haste when I don't look up the exact quote here, but I seem to recall the great Thomas Jefferson once voiced his conviction which after all these years still has appeal and finds ample support among Gold advocates: "If banks are allowed to control the money supply first through inflation, then deflation, our children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered." The implication is that banks will issue their credit from "thin air" in return for a pledge of collateral against the return of that credit, drawing in everybody such that currency values fall, prices rise, and people seek ever more loans in their desire to buy before prices rise further, with the added benefit of paying off the loan with devalued currency. But then, in their nefarious desire to rule the world, the bankers would cause the money supply to deflate, making it difficult for everyone to successfully obtain the cash needed to repay their loans. The bankers then walk away with the collateral, leaving the borrower with nothing but a bad credit rating to show for the experience. On the face of it, this seems to be a noble enough assessment, and gives rise to the equally noble suggestion that our problems would be solved if banks could simply be done away with...these institutions that were once said to be "more dangerous than standing armies." So there you have the perfect inspiration for the monetary system of your dreams, worthy of any true patriot....you suggest we eliminate banks--and with them goes the inflation-threat from the paper money they create--leaving us with only Gold coins as currency.

Not So Fast, Sport Shoes...(you'd better rethink your advice)

Ok, for the sake of indulging this off-the-cuff "perfect" solution, let's be optimistic and assume that we could indeed suddenly find ourselves in a system in which banks are non-existent, and only physical Gold coin is currency. In our euphoric pursuit of perfection, we need only to roll the clock forward from this "perfect" starting point to see that we've rashly and incorrectly assumed that our modern problems could be avoided. First come the banks out of necessity, and then the fractional-reserve lending phenomenon naturally evolves into being whether or not it was deliberately intended from the outset. Are you skeptical? Consider this: it would be a mistake to give thought to monetary matters without due consideration of the weave of our social fabric--examined through the magnifying lens of history.

In the real world, banks are necessary. We need only to look at the circumstances surrounding the appearance of the first significant public bank as documented nearly two centuries after the fact by Adam Smith in his "Wealth of Nations," written as America was just a newborn pup. The setting was Amsterdam, a bustling international trading center as the 1500's gave way to the next century. As Adam Smith describes it, the bank was formed and thrived by filling a specific market niche: addressing the corruption of the currency. In settlement of trade, Gold and silver coins from many countries and many mints (public, private, and some disreputable) were in circulation, and as is ever the case, the coins of inferior alloy or those clipped of proper weight were always the first to be offered to the merchants. In addition to the money-changing manuals that served to document the metal (money) content of the coins from the various known mints, the merchants had scales to verify the sum of coins offered as payment. However, the good quality and reputation of these scales was seen as suspect in the eyes of the shopper even as the coins were seen in the eyes of the merchants. Smith wrote: "In order to remedy inconveniences, a bank was established in 1609 under the guarantee of the City. This bank received both foreign coin, and the light worn [and other debased] coin of the country at its real intrinsic value in the good standard money of the country, deducting only so much as was necessary for defraying the expense of coinage, and other necessary expense of management. For the value which remained, after this small deduction was made, it gave a credit on its books." Here you see the coins naturally coming out of circulation in favor of "mathematically certain" bank accounting.

In this way, much of the effort and cunning that went into adulterating the coinage by men of low integrity was thereby rendered unprofitable. This system worked well for all parties involved in trade, and the popularity gave rise to similar banks in the nearby trading centers of Delft, Middlebourg, and Rotterdam, and then to other countries. (I've got to work Rotterdam into every long post...have you noticed?) History also records that "banks" have also come into being for the purpose of the security against theft. Early metal smiths also became early bankers by virtue of the security offered by their strongboxes. What practical-minded person would deny the modern need for a similar service in the event of a return to a strictly Gold-based currency system...for safekeeping and for quality assurance?

Yesterday's Performance is no Guarantee on Tomorrow in the 'Business World'

The Bank of Amsterdam was said to work well for a full century, with a man's deposits remaining his on actual deposit until such time as he transferred the money in payment to another man's account. The money (Gold) was not lent out, and so when Louis XIV's French army approached Amsterdam in 1672, causing the depositors to rush to the Bank in fear for the safety of their money, those panicky depositors all discovered that their money was indeed on hand for immediate withdrawal. The fear-induced bank run gave evidence of yet another universal truth about the nature of mankind--that when satisfied as to the apparent safety and availability of their deposits, they no longer desire to follow-through with the actual withdrawal of their funds, remaining content to let the bank serve as the guardian. And so we have the seeds of the eventual fall of the Bank of Amsterdam, and many thousands of its successors. The Bank's ownership by the City of Amsterdam gave rise to close associations with the Dutch East India Company by virtue of the same men often involved in the governing or management of both operations. Due to the nature of their business, when literally waiting for their ship to come in, even while still a solid company with solid profits, the East India Company would from time to time need a short term provision of credit. In a precursor of what modern banks would come to call their bread and butter business, the Bank began to provide these loans to the Company out of depositors accounts. When business profits turned south for the East India Company in the late 1700's as many ships and cargo were lost in the war, the loans increased, and the City government itself also came to rely on the bank for loans.

During the first century of operation, merchants preferred to receive payment in bank deposits instead of the uncertain quality of the coin of the day. But as the loans of the Bank increased, and as the Bank began to put limits on withdrawals or transfers to accounts at other banks, merchants began to cast a wary eye upon payment made in bank deposits, and they raised their prices to reflect this growing uncertainty, discounting the value of the bank money. As you might expect, when a bank can't be counted on to reliable provide your money on demand, its days are numbered. And so it was for the Bank of Amsterdam--the doors were closed in 1819. It should also come as no surprise that similar scenes were played out many times on a smaller scale by the metal smiths mentioned earlier. After being sought out for the security of their strongboxes, and after a period of reliable service, many smiths would observe the willingness of their depositors and citizens in general to leave the Gold under lock and key, opting to circulate the receipts of ownership instead. The more unscrupulous among them would come to grant loans to others for profit, or else grant loans to themselves through the issue of receipts for more Gold than they held. When rumor brought about sufficient alarm to bring in an abundance of receipts for redemption all at once, the game was up and justice was swift--though to be sure, this righting of the wrong on the inevitable day of reckoning was COMPLETELY unsatisfactory to the good citizens left holding worthless Gold-receipts from the bank after the Gold ran out.

Outright Bank Fraud IS Black and White, but this gets Very Gray, Very Quickly...

Aristotle (02/07/00; 13:14:18MDT - Msg ID:24610)
Part Four -- Outright Bank Fraud IS Black and White, but this gets Very Gray Very Quickly...
You have likely identified the problem in both of these examples: the entity providing the banking service began issuing loans using their customers' deposits without the consent and cooperation of the depositor. Let's consider an example in which the bank is of the most noble character and management, simply offering safe storage and quality assurance of the Gold currency. It is human nature that those with wealth--such as we might find among those having deposits in our hypothetical Noble Bank--might seek to generate some income with their wealth. They might play an active role in this attempt as a venture capitalist, offering their money directly to entrepreneurs in return for some profits after personal negotiations convince them of the viability of the prospect.

But not all would-be lenders and borrowers are well suited to negotiate and organize such arrangements themselves, particularly the smaller would-be lenders seeking an income, and the smaller would-be borrowers seeking funds for such things as small business expenses. The Noble Bank easily develops the in-house expertise in evaluating those borrowers that represent a good credit risk, and can organize the formal loan arrangements on behalf of their depositors. And rather than matching up a depositor/lender with a borrower on a personal, individual basis, the Noble Bank would come to pool the depositors' funds into an anonymous operation in which the profits from the lending of capital are then provided to the depositors (minus the Bank's own profit for providing this service) according to the amount of funds the depositor put into account with the bank. This provides the flexibility demanded by the banking depositor to generally be able to access his funds as needed.

It's like this. Assume that you, me, and someone else have all put $10 in Gold coin on deposit with the Noble Bank for safe keeping, with the added hope to earn a return on the Bank's ability to lend it at a profit in the meanwhile. Let's say a shoe cobbler needs to buy leather and a new sewing machine in order to make new shoes, so the bank lends him $18 of the $30 available. The cobbler takes his borrowed Gold, makes his purchases, and sets to work in order to repay the bank $19 from his anticipated profits within the coming months. In the meantime, you incur unanticipated expenses, and need to obtain your $10 deposit from the Bank. Because this Bank wants to keep you happy, and to retain your future business, it doesn't tell you that $6 of your account is currently unavailable (out on loan) as per your wishes for the bank to earn you an income, and that the cobbler will be returning it (along with the profit you sought) in regular installments over a period of time. Instead, the Noble Bank gives you $10 of its remaining $12, and hopes that neither me or that third depositor will want to reclaim our deposits anytime soon.

Here you can see that no money was created out of thin air. But the size of the Noble Bank grows as a good track-record of management attracts ever more deposits in which withdrawals don't threaten the remaining funds on reserve, and the depositors all come to perceive through their good experience that the entirety of their account is available to them should they need it. The bank would accommodate this concept of reality by shuffling the credit distribution among accounts to provide the depositor's money on demand. This creates the illusion of money being in more than one pocket at the same time through no *fault* or evil intent of the Noble Bank. This is what the users of the System want, and this is what we got. And as the cobbler's leather supplier deposits the cobbler's Gold payment into the neighboring Honest Bank in order to earn a return, the process may continue yet further. The economy seems to experience an abundant money supply, and the purchasing power of all funds are thereby diminished by rising prices as the actual goods offered for sale are then held more dearly than the money which has suddenly become so easy to come by.

Please note that in this example, I didn't once use the term interest in connection with the lending of money. A great many of the over-zealous Gold advocates try to equate the lending of money at interest with the evils of usury, so I purposely avoided that trap which has become a mental stumbling block in their thinking. While they might be inclined to say rightly or wrongly that lending at interest should be banned in order to eliminate the "sin" of usury, they certainly can't make that claim against the form of venture capitalism that I laid out above. And if the banks come to define the terms of providing venture capital from their available pool of deposits as a standard low interest rate rather than higher claims on profits that vary from borrower to borrower, what's the harm?

Too Much of a Good Thing

A quick historical note is in order here on the position of famed economist David Ricardo, who was a strong supporter of the Bullion Committee and its position in favor of the Gold Standard in monetary discussions hosted by the Bank of England in the early 1800's. The purpose of the discussions was to get to the root of the problem regarding rising prices, including uncoined Gold bullion. The center of the debate was whether bank notes--which by that time had formed the bulk of circulating money supply--were losing value, or was Gold simply rising in price? Given the observation that other prices (such as bread) were rising, the verdict was against the bank notes, just as it was in the latter years of the Bank of Amsterdam when the merchants had diminished faith that the bank could successfully redeem its credits for Gold coins. In the course of the debates, Ricardo described in his works "it was most justly contended that a currency, to be perfect, should be absolutely invariable in value." While conceding that precious metals couldn't be held to the desired level of perfect invariability, they remain the best-suited item we have discovered. And yet while holding this position, Ricardo was not completely opposed to bank notes, finding them to be economical and convenient, so long as they were always fully exchangeable for metal upon demand.

I'll say again, if the Noble Bank could legitimately tell a rational depositor that a portion of his deposit wasn't immediately available for withdrawal, then things would likely be closer to OK, with the bank notes in circulation representing the Gold allocated to the borrower and properly held aside for redemption of the note as Ricardo would have it. While this sounds good initially, there would still be some perception of an abundant Gold supply due to the borrowed funds hitting the marketplace, and there would still tend to be the resulting diminution of the currency's purchasing power. And further, the banks would always try to accommodate the depositor's desire to withdraw funds by reallocating their available resources, leading to a false (and eventually fatal) sense of security in the general nature and supply of money.

As you can see from everything above, it begins innocently enough. The depositors' money is physically distributed (unlike the ledger creation of credit-money used today,) but it would not be long before the depositors who had thus risked their deposits for a return came to have faith that their full deposit would be returned with interest, and acted on faith as though the Gold was actually still at their immediate disposal. But inevitably, the day always comes when confidence is in short supply, and depositors rush en masse to reclaim their deposits, feeling that money in-hand is more desired than the prospects of any returns that the bank may have to offer, or perhaps fearing for the viability of the bank itself and its ability to provide Gold for the quantity of funds in account.

And as it begins innocently enough, it ends innocently enough, too. The availability for the common man to get a loan serves as an undeniably equalizing force in society. It allows a poor person with time and energy to participate in the economy on par with a man who has his own capital. Through the credit obtained from the banks' pool of deposits, a borrower is able to gain possession of land, buildings, tools, raw materials, or other goods and facilities with which to become a farmer, manufacturer, or merchant--using the profits from his time, energy and know-how to earn a living for himself and to compensate his lenders for their extension of credit. The poorer and more wretched a man might be, the more he might wish for the presence of a bank of low standards willing to extend credit to the likes of him.

The Same Old Arguments have Always Been With Us...

But despite this common desire for banks, even from the very beginning there has always been an element of society that for one reason or another saw banks as fraudulent means of transferring the wealth of honest workers to an elite group (the lenders) with agendas to rule the world. In a letter to John Adams about his own fear and loathing over the proliferation of banks and their issuance of paper credit, Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1814: "I have ever been the enemy of banks; not of those discounting for cash; but of those foisting their own paper into circulation, and thus banishing our cash. ...these are to ruin both republic and individuals. This cannot be done. The Mania [of borrowing and lending] is too strong. It has seized by its delusions and corruptions all the members of our governments, general, special, and individual." But in contrast to Jefferson, in a little-publicized footnote of history, Benjamin Franklin was a strong supporter of paper money. He saw that a national paper money provided a "general benefit" of facilitating alternatives for a government against the dual "horrors" to its citizenry of taxation and deflation. And as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, very "specific benefits" were seen on an individual basis by those who sought loans of any form of bank money (Gold, paper, credit, whatever) in order to improve their position in life.

Because the "little guy" clamors for loans just as the "big guy" who pursues bigger projects, and because the banks (which were naturally established to help the marketplace maintain the safety and quality of its original Gold currency) come to naturally play the middleman between the population with money to lend to the population seeking to borrow, the blame for all that follows is hard to pin on anyone specifically. Almost everyone in modern society comes to rely on the continuing and smooth operation of the banking system. As outlined throughout this commentary, you can see that as civilization advances and as the economy expands and the population grows, the general trend is for the apparent money supply to expand, even if the banks themselves do nothing more than efficiently reallocate deposits as needed to keep everybody happy. The threat of a bank run grows with the growing disconnect between what is perceived as the fair value contained in the underlying Gold contained in the coin that originally defined the currency unit, versus the witnessed purchasing power of the same currency units as dictated by the apparently swollen supply as borrowed and efficiently allocated by banks. Due to the unacceptably disruptive nature of bank runs on society, and the hurt inflicted on those who were late to the doors and therefore left holding worthless receipts of a newly failed bank, the inevitable outcome (generally tolerated by most) is two-fold. First, for the officially-sanctioned (government) regulation or development of a national central bank to bring more order to the hodgepodge of wayward private banks, and second, for the eventual officially-sanctioned termination of Gold convertibility for the abundance of circulating bank notes and bank deposits on account.

Stay tuned for the final(?) part(s) to be offered later (I've already burned up enough of your patience and space for one day):
Who is to Blame When the System Fails? And How can Sir Gresham's Simple Law Save Us?

Aristotle (2/10/2000; 3:37:44MDT - Msg ID:24877)
Part Five "Building the Perfect System by Capitalizing on Gresham's Law" --starting at (2/7/2000; 7:15MDT - Msg ID:24589) from link below
http://www.usagold.com/cpmforum/archives/720002/default.html
Who's to Blame When the System Fails?

Perhaps it would be clearer if I rephrased that question. "The System" as I've defined it is the ever-changing monetary principles, policies, and practices seen in the course of satisfying the real demands of conducting business and commerce among real people. At any given moment, the System is undergoing change from one form to another, generally smooth and gradual, but occasionally abrupt and painful. But never in the largest sense can the System itself be said to "fail," although parts of it certainly prove troublesome and are altered from time to time as economic efficiency dictates. Did the old Gold Standard era System "fail" when there was a bank run at one institution or another? Well, if you were a depositor who didn't get your deposits out before that particular bank closed its doors, you might indeed be inclined to say that the System failed. But more specifically, it failed YOU. Meanwhile, your contemporaries who lived half a continent away might say that the bank closure was a healthy adjustment to the system, weeding out a weak bank. As such, System "failure" might be viewed as any time YOU were legitimately dissatisfied with its performance. Therefore, it would probably be more appropriate to ask this question instead: "Who is to blame when the System disappoints you?" An important thought to consider in this regard is whether any conceivable System could please all of the people all of the time.

Let's briefly examine the dissatisfaction of the typical Goldheart. In his mind the System has failed because he is dissatisfied all the time--so long as Gold is not the circulating currency, apparently. How irrational is that? Romantic, to be sure, but completely irrational. This superficial desire will never be the impetus for a change to the System as we know it. Even in the "good ol' days" the coins quickly gave way to bank notes as the circulating equivalent. There simply must be more at stake than the whimsical preferences of an individual in order to inspire change.

Something to rally around...

Here's the key factor as detailed earlier in this commentary which ultimately argues forcefully for the proper role of Gold in the monetary system's architecture. In what has been revealed as a misplaced goal, with Gold as the circulating currency, artificial inflation of the Gold supply is the unavoidable consequence because money will always be lent by somebody to somebody else who wants to borrow. As a result, under any past System architecture, there has never been a truly satisfactory means to safely and reliably escape the ravages of inflation and deflation. Having Gold attached either directly or indirectly to the circulating currency (or Gold itself subject to being lent independently as we see today), the proper valuation of Gold is always understated by the market due to the perception of of an increased (artificial) supply. Truth be told, it is this element that gives rise to my own dissatisfaction--that Gold is not at all points in time held near to its honest physical-based monetary valuation as it should be. This is true at nearly all points in time except for those brief and historic moments when the adjustment inevitably comes and Gold reaches an entirely new price plateau. This proves unacceptable for those who live in the interim periods as they strive to protect their personal wealth...those holding Gold during these past 20 years, for example. (Although make no mistake, the extent of currency depreciation in various non-OECD nations would paint a more normal looking picture for citizens holding Gold within those countries.)

As the number of people increases who are dissatisfied with the System's performance at any given moment in time, the greater the pressure mounts to effect some degree of change. Similarly, the greater the level of dissatisfaction, the greater the impetus to effect some rectifying change. For those who are yet clinging to the notion that we need a Gold Standard with fixed convertibility of the currency, please forgive me as I verbally try once again to shake you out of your mental stupor. Under a Gold Currency-based system, any time someone borrowed money they would in essence be participating in a Gold loan (much as we see happening today--an act that is ill-tolerated by those who can rightly recognize its depressing effect on the value of that same Gold/Money.) For the hundredth time, because people will always have a desire to borrow money to meet their business or personal needs at one point or another, you would always be dissatisfied by any Gold Standard that allowed these (Gold-) loans to occur. Meanwhile, everyone else would be dissatisfied by such a Gold Standard System that specifically pleased you in which money (which would be Gold) could not be borrowed as needed.

Accepting the constraints of the real world...

Any properly functioning monetary system in the real world must accommodate those seeking to borrow funds. And if I've made no other point but one, we should all see from the extensive commentary (bludgeoning) presented earlier that such a system cannot sustainably coexist with a Gold Standard which has a fixed convertibility. Inflation is always a consequence, and then so are bank runs, a phenomenon unique to any such Standard of fixed convertibility. There can be little denying that those bank runs are the ultimate monetary catastrophe experienced on an individual basis. Think about it. If you were among the depositors left with unhonored deposits of metal on account at a failed bank, you might just as well be located in a modern-day Third World nation when its currency loses value...your life's savings have been wiped out through no fault of your own.

Examining this case of a bank run, everything was working fine for you and your currency-units yesterday, but then suddenly your world fell apart today. In truth, to witness that a bank run was "justified" by the bank's obvious (after the fact) shortfall of Gold necessary to honor all of the deposits reveals with abundant clarity that a goodly portion of the system's funds were actually "unbacked" currency. And since these same unbacked currencies were seen to be functioning well prior to the pain of the bank run, it makes little sense to those left holding the bag in a bank run. And as hard as it is for these unfortunate citizens to fathom fundamentally why these currencies could work yesterday but not today, it is even harder for them to grasp why the same currency could function properly at the front of the bank line, but not for those in the back end of the line. It is this kind of pain, especially when bank runs become an epidemic, that compel significant changes to be made to the System architecture. History reveals that a natural starting point to ease this pain is national regulation of the scattered and various independent private banks.

This leads to a united-we-stand, divided-we-fall solution in which resources are managed among the banks so that individual hemorrhages can be addressed without leading to domino-style bank failures. But ultimately, the whole system is put at unacceptable risk from bank runs inspired by the realization that the bank-money inflation has rendered a currency value that is less than the metal value in the system's few coins. Again, the institutional thinking goes, "Since all this unbacked paper worked yesterday, let's just get rid of the inspiration for bank runs--the Gold coins." Those finding themselves in the back of the lines certainly would welcome this. Their currency would not only remain just as good as the currency held by those in the front of the line, but it would also be not significantly different than it was yesterday.

OK, so who IS to be blamed for our disappointment with the System as it is?

The lesson to be learned is not to blame the push for fiat currency upon "the few and powerful" men of wealth of the world. While inflation can be bad even under a Gold Standard (along with the pain of bank runs for those who fail to rescue their deposits), inflation has the distinct opportunity and track-record to be much worse within a system built upon a fiat currency. The truth is, inflation hurts those with money (it erodes their purchasing power), and helps those with debts (it makes loan repayment easier.) David Ricardo said it eloquently: "The depreciation of the circulating medium has been more injurious to monied men...It may be laid down as a principle of universal application that every man is injured or benefited by the variation of the value of the circulating medium in proportion as his property consists of money, or as the fixed demands on him in money exceed those fixed demands which he may have on others." He said further that the farmer "more than any other class of the community is benefited by the depreciation of money, and injured by the increase of its value." This is likely for the dual reason that farmers as a general rule were often in debt to begin with, and because their annual creation of crops (from thin air!) could then be sold for more currency units in each subsequent year, even if the net real-world value of the product being offered remained entirely unchanged.

Don't waste energy on laying blame...

And so we can see, with more people in society having common wealth than uncommon fortune, it is distinctly the case that democracy proves to be the greater threat to a convertible Gold Standard than does even the unmanageable expense of war. I faintly recalled some historical figure who made the astute observation that in a democratic society, when the people come to realize that they can vote "largess" for themselves from the public treasury, they will do so, and hence bring about their system's collapse. And in researching this matter further (thanks Journeyman, ji, and RossL for your help) it seems that there actually have been a number of figures echoing this same sentiment through time. But regardless of the precise citation of this quotation, one look at the growing national debt in America (serving as the substitute for the taxes that would otherwise be necessary to fund our chosen social programs) gives credence to this assertion. Simply put: the people (the masses) get what the people want--and the people want easy money. Even outside of a democracy, over time, the forces of the population always win out over the forces of the few men of power. And in the end it matters not which group is on the side of good, and which is destructive--the many prevail over the few.

So, what is the proper role of Gold in the monetary system architecture?

At this point, the staunchest Gold supporters are likely gnashing their teeth and forming a posse to hunt me down for a proper lynching, I'm sure. After all, I have made no bones about the need to cut Gold out of any ties whatsoever with the various national currencies. Due to inflation and deflation that naturally arise through variations in the rates of borrowing, payback, and growth of the economy, currency fluctuations lead to bank runs which are frankly too disruptive and are not to be tolerated. Fortunately, they are rendered completely meaningless under a fiat currency regime. National fiat currencies allow governments to manage their own national economies to the extent that that are able, and to take whatever efforts needed to avoid falling into those most destructive currency deflations that wreak havoc on economies.

Gold must be removed from these currencies so that governments are not tempted to manipulate its perceived value in order to give a boost to their own currency. The goal would be that sudden value shocks will be avoided because at all points in time the currencies will be fairly valued against Gold--there won't be an inevitable and recurring "day of reckoning" in which the pent-up false perceptions are unwound amid calamity and crisis of confidence. Gold must also be removed from any element of the monetary system that would seek to make loans using Gold because, as we've seen, these confound Gold's ability to reach its true physical-based fair market value. Gold derivatives must also be done away with for the same reason. Gold must remain a pure monetary asset, bought and sold and owned outright--nothing else would be allowable. National fiat currencies will ably serve the market's various needs to borrow funds...after all, that's how fiat currency is born in the first place.

Although I've seemingly cut Gold out of the monetary system, that is not the case at all. Gold qualifies as the only true money; being able to function as a unit of account, as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value. A fiat currency only meets the first two elements, but they fail as a store of value. Therefore, Gold will be be the money of savings, while national currencies will be the currency of commerce. They will all float relative to each other, and constantly seek out their proper value. Kept with special status as an independent and unlendable currency, Gold will be the ever-rising North Star of the monetary system. Central banks would be inclined to hold only Gold in reserves of any significant size--because Gold is not the liability of any other nation, and its real-world value would continue to grow over time. As said before, quantities held in other national currencies would be done only to the extent that they facilitate trade between active partners. Individuals across the Earth would also choose to hold Gold as their savings; their life's productivity forever protected from inflation and deflation, and from reliance upon another person's (or nation's) liability.

The beauty of reserving Gold as an unmanipulated monetary asset is that individual local currencies can still be "managed" by the government in whatever manner is seen befitting that specific country, without having an adverse effect on the meaningful wealth held in reserves (in the form of Gold savings) among other nations and local citizens alike. No single national currency need ever be held by another nation as a reserve currency (which "unfairly" allows the nation that issues the reserve currency to export its inflation.) However, a nation might choose to hold another's currency in a quantity simply because it makes for expedient trade.

The reassurance of Gresham's Law...

Perhaps a short lesson is in order for those new to this realm of thought. In 1558, Sir Thomas Gresham made his observation that whenever there was latitude in tendering payment (as could be seen in the major medieval cities where coins from many lands came together in the course of trade--as we covered in the case of Amsterdam,) inevitably the money of poorest quality was offered while the better money was retained. In describing the circulation of currency, Gresham's law says that bad money drives out good. (The inferior money circulates, while money of superior quality is held.) In our new system herein described, paper currency will circulate while Gold money will be saved.

Pause for a moment to fully consider this practical notion of saving Gold on one hand, while on the other, borrowing and spending paper just as we always have in our lifetimes (and know of no other reality from personal experience.) This is in perfect tune with Gresham's law. Given our own limited history, this accord with Gresham's law provides a very comforting reassurance for predicting the success of this system. Why? Because Gresham's law is arguably the only economic law that survives beyond challenge--an echo of the universal and enduring truth that given a choice, people will choose the option that serves their own needs best. Gresham's law predicts that the world's supreme currency, Gold, would not actually circulate in a conventional sense, though it would move from the hand of one saver to another as individual circumstances might require. Sure, you could use it outright as money if you insisted, but nodding to Gresham's law, wouldn't you rather keep your Gold for the rainy day and spend your paper instead? This system will enhance the transparency of national economics and financial positions, rewarding those with good fiscal policy and balanced budgets, and giving none an exorbitant privilege over another through reserve currency status. It will allow the citizens a natural avenue to protect themselves against depreciation of the national currencies (which will inevitably inflate until the end of time,) and to actually gain a no-risk real "return" by simply holding the metal without the self-defeating aspect of lending it out for interest.

Gold. Get you some. ---Aristotle

------
What is to stop the gold markets to regroup and form a new gold banking system?
------
Q:
Please define "gold markets" in the context you use? We need to know exactly what this market is before one can "bank on it"!
----
I would think that - if there is gold there is also someoned to lend it and someone to borrow it.
---------
Q: Why use gold to create a lending contract? Would society use gold as a "lend able" account unit if it freezes any further function of their money asset? To date, the history of the past gold systems points that such a function creates gridlock in the banking system. Doesn't this contradict the first purpose of gold: to act as a pay as we go medium, under no contract risk?
---------
If there is new gold mined, it will be contracted for future delivery.
----------
Q: Again, Why must gold be used? And why the illusion of future delivery in contract form? If society places a high enough value (currency price) on it, a" no collateral financing" would easily create a pay as you go operation, NO?
-------------
If there is gold of many players in a number of vaults, the gold will stay in the vaults and the title to the gold will trade electronically.
-----------------------------------
Q: Tell me, do we pay for our gasoline with "stock certificates" of IBM? Or any other ware - housed asset. Would not real estate titles also trade electronically? In this period of high speed trade, digits of anything could do the trick, no?
-----------------

I still say that there is no economic reason, no justification for central banks at all. There is no
economically useful purpose for national currencies.
-------------------
Observation: Years of history and the nature of modern society say you are wrong, no? Our use of digital currencies for trade always flows like a river that's strong and wide,,,,, and it always flows to it's end in the sea. The water takes it into the air and rains it again upon the headwaters for another trip,,,,,a new currency starts again. All the while gold is held from it's value as officials grapple with it's position on the currency river,,,,,,,,,, stopping it's use as a wealth asset held by all.
--------------------
I will go further and state that the purpose of central banks holding gold is so their people remain beholden to the state and the bank cartels it has chartered. The best thing for the CBs and treasuries to do is to unload their gold and cease participation in the financial markets. Individuals
and private organizations should hold their gold and trade its receipts, to lend and to borrow it.
-----------------
Observation: Again, society has proven that any and all currencies and moneys that are lent and borrowed,,,,,'soon become corrupted. Even gold itself,,,,,many times! Let gold become an asset of real wealth,,,,,and it will shine as the best background money this modern world has ever seen,,NO?
-----------
The amount of gold and other PMs can not be insufficient in quantity to for the basis for the volume of trade settlement. It is precisely the point that the quantity of gold matters not. What matters is that it grows with the economy that trades it as money.
----------------
Q: What will you do today that is different from yesterday? Can we pass laws that remove human nature?
----------
The myth of a living and breathing fiat system. Many have proposed that there is some need in trade and business for the flexible money that fiat allows. I contend that there is no such flexible money, as its cost in trade and to business far outweighs the benefits of flexion.
------------------------------
Observation: We want and use this "flexion" today. Is not the only thing missing,,,,,,,,,,a way to shield
our wealth from the effects of this "flexion"'s inflation ,,,,
--------------------------------
Fiat currencies do not expand and contract as the markets need. Their mere existence forbids healthy interaction in the markets. The seekers of the conversion of income into wealth and those who must convert wealth into income are forbidden from setting the rates of conversion by the
existence of fiat currencies. The necessary precondition of a fiat currency is the existence of a monetary authority that controls the quantity and the rate of conversion - the interest rate - at which both monetary and "real" wealth
coverts into income.
------------------------------
Perhaps: But no one ever said that wealth was digits? no? A Western view of a world that's always going mad?

Hello ORO,
Well, I knew that if I only asked, we would all receive! Boy did you deliver in ORO (Msg ID:25113).
Good stuff for everyone to read, my friend. You mentioned; """ The comments below - particularly those to Aristotle, are somewhat harsh. I hope this is taken in the spirit of friendly criticism."""

Sir, you can serve me (and probably everyone here) your "harsh" anytime. Waiter ,,,,,,,, I'll have a double order of that please! (smile)

OK, brace yourself ORO ,,,,,, a big plate of my "Trail" harsh coming up!

=============================

You write:
-------There are consequences to the existence of a fiat currency and for the use of debt money for trade settlement. FIAT HAS NEVER BEEN THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE ACTING IN
COMMERCE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD. Even when wildly popular, fiat money has not had a single instance when it had not been established by force - by laws imposing its use.-----------

ORO,

On a larger scale there was always more to it than this. Human society has from the very beginnings formed tribes and picked sides against each other. When we are not battling nation against nation, we jockey for position within our own groups. Right down to "me and my neighbour against the three houses down the street. As a tribe ,,, as a nation ,,,,,, as a group ,,,,,, our war is really a human problem with each other and always has been. In better context; the problems are in the way we use our laws and governments to gain advantage over the next in line.

Whether through force (war) or democratic means, we subject ourselves to the order of governments. We rightly perceive that,,,,,, the order gained from this action ,,,,,,, the security of a group, overcomes the rights and property lost on a individual level that living in a tribe requires. It's been this way through the ages. It's a political process that has always had it's in house battles ,,,,, namely portions of society try to circumvent their percentage of lost rights and property by maneuvering the rules (laws) in their favor. Yes,,,,,if I can gain the advantages of tribe life and still keep my "portions lost",,,,,I'm gaining wealth to the disadvantage of the group. Truly, the most obvious action of not paying your taxes,,,,,and that's only a small item when viewing the world battle as a whole.

So, how does this apply to money?

When you and others say """ FIAT HAS NEVER BEEN THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE ACTING IN COMMERCE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD """ ,,,,,this is true.

This is true, but this was never the thrust of the argument. The use of money in any context, fiat, gold or seashells, has always entailed the use of borrowing and lending... And as long as economies function at a profit, debts are made and paid back without argument. However, when the eventual downturn arrives, some portions (perhaps a large portion) of the owed wealth (debt) cannot be
returned.

It's here,,,,at this point in tribal life,,,,,,,that all of the context from above comes into play. The "reality" of life on this earth is this: ,,,,,,Some portion of society will use their influence or control of the leaders to make their debts easier to pay. In fact,,,,,it's times 2 for that number of government influencers ,,,, because even the ones that have debt owed to them will try to alleviate an impossible pay back situation the ones that owe them face.

You see,,,,,tribal life and the human nature that comes with it,,,,,,,,will not allow any money system to "completely" destroy the wealth of a good portion of society. Even if everyone is plainly shown that they are going to lose something ,,,,,,they would still option for the good of the overall tribe. This is why we return,,,,time and again to fiat monetary systems. In the few examples where a gold system brings the harsh reality of loses to bear on a nation,,,,,,usually war is the result. Not a
good outcome.

Yes, we can break gold into many small parts,,,,,'stamp it into coins and circulate gold certificates as money. We can borrow it, lend it and also circulate gold bonds as the economy grows. It is the perfect "weights and measures" monetary system. Exactly representing our productive efforts in every faucet of human endeavour. But, when the loses mount, our tribal human tendencies will not allow us to support a government or banking system that forces these real loses on only a portion of the group. Never has,,,,and never will! Without this escape valve, we go to war ,,,,,, internaly or on a world scale,,, so we all can share the loss,,,one way or another. As a human society of thousands of years,,,outside of war,,,,,we have learned to inflate our loses upon everyone as a whole,,,,,for the good of the keeping the whole from each others throats. Even to the
point of a total loss of the current system,,,,,and all the destruction that entail's for everyone.

Yes, indeed,,,,,,,we will transition to the next fiat system from the dollar, when the time comes. Believe it!

Further:

For myself and other observers ,,,,, we know about "peace on earth" and live our life in this context but,,,,as a member of the world tribe,,,,,,and following our best interest,,,,,, one must still arrange his affairs to shield their family from the "I'm going to get yours" times we live in. Should we get our leaders to help us? Well, the leaders of this world can only be but a reflection of us as a
whole. Yes, many things are not right, but they can only strive to do what can be done, not what must be done.

Consider the dilemma:
If a small portion of society telegraphs thoughts that "if we cannot have our oil we will go to war",,,,,,,,how would you force them to not elect officials that ease their pain in a gold money system? What's right and what's wrong is not the issue,,,,,,it's what this present generation will live with that rules. If they will break the gold yoke, no matter,,,,then why place gold on them? Is it not better to at least free the "knight" (gold) for the good of those that would stand with him?

During the period we are now entering,,,,,we can see all the ugly aspects of a fiat system that is failing it's tribe. Look far and wide and witness the various groups ,,,, all jockeying for position as they use whatever influence they have to lessen their own private loses. If this had been a gold system, the outcome would be the same,,,,,as players force their leaders to lessen the gold debts that could not be paid. They would raise the price of gold and inflate their way out of it,,,,,,for better or worse ,,,, come hell or high water.

So, my friend (smile),,,,,,,as you can see,,,,,I completely agree with all of your post. Only, my trail is hiked with a different mind. "Another" mind set, if you will. We use the life experiences of man to dictate the best path to follow. As such,,,,,,Gold must not be part of any money system,,,,,,it must reside as a freely traded asset without debt or paper to resemble it. In this position ,,,,, it's value can fully represent the ebb and flow of the affairs of man. And in doing so retain the wealth of man
as a holding of things. Truly, the "Wealth of Nations" in the peoples hands. We move forward by starting at the beginning of time.

We'll talk much about this and all the affairs of the world,,,including gold,,,, on the gold trail.

"We walk this new gold trail together, yes?" I hope to see everyone there when I return.

Request for Comments on OPEC Oil Cutbacks

Hello Elwood,
We are seeing the media blow everything out of proportion these days. The oil cut-backs were in no way what was reported! It was more of an adjustment. see the above article (there is a follow up also). Actually, oil management is working very well now.
Today, with oil more likely rising into the $45 range, we are getting a small view of where gold, in oil dollars should be. The mechanics (gears) of all of this are turning now. Prior to this we had the political software installed that literally placed gold "on the road" to much higher prices. The US / IMF have been managing this turn-a-round,,, trying to keep it from exploding too quickly (they did
a good job too!).
I'll be talking much more (and very clearly) about this later "on the trail".

thanks

Saudi denies reports of March oil export cuts

DUBAI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter, on Monday denied reports that it had cut its March crude exports to the West by 25 to 35 percent.

\`\`The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) has refuted recent news reports that it has cut its March deliveries of crude oil between 25-35 percent to some regions of the world as 'misleading and incorrect','' the state oil giant said in a statement faxed to Reuters.

Gold
http://www.fame.org/HTM/Mundell%20and%20Parks.htm
NOTE: These are (see the bottom) segments of questions and answers copied from this interview. I PLACE THEM OUT OF CONTEXT TO UNDERSCORE THE THOUGHT! Please see the link above for the full discussion. It's very good and so is Mr. Park's and his site.

ALSO: The point I was trying to make in #25137 (and the question I was asking) was this;
A full gold money system works during level and rising economic dynamics. It also works "VERY" well during a downturn. In fact it works "Perfectly" all the time! It's the lending of money that creates debt, be it gold debt or fiat debt ,,,, and the failure of that debt during a downturn is what causes the pain.

I ,,,,, we as gold bugs ,,,,,, most financial thinkers ,,,,, do not debate this point. The argument is that:
If the pain dynamic (loses) of a financial downturn is not "Somewhat" shared by society as a whole ,,,,, the economic dislocation always intensifies until we go to conflict. (see my earlier post)

It's during the downturns that society in general will not tolerate a full gold system because it concentrates the loses upon their rightful owners. As such "these same" are usually "wiped completely out" and their fallout effects on the social and economic structure can be widespread and very destructive to tribal life.
Again, history has proven, time and time again that humans will not allow the full (natural) effects of gold money ,,,,, if it threatens to create factions. They accept gold during long periods until conflict (internally political or externally war) forces a break in the gold bond.
We as nations will break the "gold bond" by calling for the shared pain of inflation. Whether we (as countrymen) understand the reasoning behind it or not; currency inflation (not price inflation) in the modern world is carried out until it's debt destroys the current system ,,, there by, sharing all the pain of the loses before it. We then move into the next fiat system.

The question:

Is it not better for all ,,,, if we remove gold from the official currency structure by forcing derivitives failure and creating a free physical only marketplace,,,,, so as to keep "US" ,,,,,, ourselves ,,,,,, from controlling it through our politicians?
Through "legal tender laws" currently in place ,,, let's force us (ourselves) to continue to create debts only in paper.
As such, "they" ,, "we" can manipulate the fiat as needed for society.
Does this not place gold in it's rightful position of being a "real currency asset" as it was chosen to be used from the beginning of time?
A private money for trade and savings that's outside the "contract / debt' system. Your thoughts?

Trail Guide

Robert Mundell:
--------I think that legal tender is a very old institution. It certainly goes back thousands of years and legal tender is an institution, whether we like it or not is going to stay. ----------

Robert Mundell :
------There's no institutional mechanism by which we could ever duplicate the kind of financial system we have under a system that relied almost entirely upon gold. Of course you could always have a system that used a lot of paper that was in some sense convertible into gold. You could always find a price of gold that you could convert that paper theoretically into gold. But I don't think anyone has thought in terms of the enormous price of gold that would be required in order to achieve that.-----------

Larry Parks:
---------George Soros says in his book Soros on Soros that the gold standard had to be given up because it did not make possible a lender of last resort. And says Soros, because financial markets are in his words "inherently unstable" you have to have a lender of last resort.-------

Thanks for your reply, ORO.
My comments presume that readers have read our full posts.
Your major point, logic and comments that I got from your post (25310) , followed by my comments:

POINT:
I pointed out that it is the existence of a "lender of last resort" that causes the debt boom

Logic:
It is obvious then, that had there not been a lender of last resort there would not have been a substantial credit crunch, because the lenders would not have taken the same risks they allowed themselves once a promise of bailout was given, and thus would have avoided the credit boom.

Your Comments:
The argument is false in that it is circular. (Trail Guide note: I think he is referring to my logic?) The lender of last resort was there in the first place, the inevitable credit boom followed, the credit crunch followed - just as inevitable - and a further lender of last resort was needed. History shows that the credit policies of the BOE led to its bankruptcy before WWI and before the Fed was created. This was among the reasons for the argument for the Fed being pressed. All the previous lenders of last resort were tapped out and a new one was necessary. In 1929-1930 the Fed was
tapped out and the gold standard obligation was abolished shortly after.

My Comments:
ORO, I cannot accept that a "lender of last resort" causes a debt boom. It presumes that a great portion of lending is done for reckless, uneconomic reasons. Yet, at the end of great expansions many projects that were considered "blue chip" in the beginning still go bad. Sometimes, the most necessary economic activity is curtailed because peoples needs change during the course of life ,,,
not to mention a recession. Thus changing business dynamics.

How many instances can we document where banks lent into real demand ,,,,,,, backed with the very best demographic patterns ,,,,, only to find the loan blow up from changing demand. Oil in the late seventies would be a convenient example for us (smile). People were breaking down the doors
of the old "Texas Commerce Bank" in Houston ,,,,,,, all in an effort to finance hugely profitable petroleum projects. This was no flash in the pan, as the oil industry had a progressive expansion history of 15++ years before this. Truly, a lender of last resort was the very last thing on their minds. Later, even paper based on $10 producing reserves was trashed! Certainly there are many, many other examples,,,,,,,, most are of a more mundane, unglamorous nature, but fine examples.

Further:
Was this really circular thinking on our part? Did the Lender of last resort exist during the 'South Sea Bubble" or the "Tulip mania",,,,,, and did the "Black Plague" of Europe shut down a few sound financial systems then? I think gold was the norm in that period?

ORO, this portion of your thinking needs to include the other side of the lending aspect,,,,,, people want and demand loans for sound, economically justifiable, profitable projects,,,, and they get them on sound lending principles. Still, some 90% of them can become only "at the margin"
when demand changes. And typical of our human society, we all shift at once.

Truly, my friend, bank loans often fail because human events change the course of money dynamics,,,,,, and it does so in a way that is beyond the vision of any lender. Be the lenders you, me or a group of people as a bank, large portions of deals go bad just as much from human affairs
as from "over lending".

After all, the entire economic structure of the world is nothing more than people dynamic ,,,,,,,,, in the long run it's just too risky to bet ones physical gold on (huge smile)!

Yes, our present financial system gives the impression of total insanity,,,, but we are looking at the very "end of the timeline",,,, not how it began. It all starts with the very first loan and progresses until everyone has borrowed "too much", but no one wants the music to stop. Last resort lenders then become the norm because society will lose "across the board" if everything is "marked to the market". It is not a circle (smile) as it starts and ends with the currency system (gold or fiat) everyone demands to borrow into. It all ends in the shared pain of debt collapse as the debt is discounted to zero from price inflation ,,,, even if it's based on gold ,,,,,, gold that cannot be returned. Not much different from our present gold loan structure.
We will move on to the next money system when this one ends.

If it were gold we started with? The banker would lend his gold only to find the same metal returned to his bank as a new deposit. The "society at large" would remove his franchise if he did not re-lend that same gold during "good times", "booming times" no less! Round and round the gold
goes. Reserve lending hits it's limit and society demands the limits be raised again ,,, and again ,,, and again! Lender of last ,,,,,, or not.
In our modern world we must remove gold from the official money system, place it in a free market and people will use it as wealth money, not borrowing money. Then the fiat can come and go as the wind! Yes?
You agree now!
I'm so very glad!

Elwood,

I have read much of Mises and even a few others. Actually, I completely agree with them that the Gold money systems of the nineteenth century worked very well. As such we do not fall into any groups that argue against that concept. Our problem is with people (smile).

In a Money and Freedom speech at a Mises meeting Mr. Joseph T. Salerno made this point:
-------Unfortunately, the monetary freedom represented by the gold standard, along with many other freedoms of the classical liberal era, was brought to a calamitous end by World War One.----------

Further, he stated:
------Within weeks of the outbreak of World War One, all belligerent nations departed from the gold standard. Needless to say by the wars end the paper fiat currencies of all these nations were in the throes of inflation of varying degrees of severity, with the German hyperinflation that culminated in 1923 being the worst.---------------

My point (as an extension of earlier posts):
No country, however rich in gold or resources, can continue to fight a war once their money runs out! Consider ,,,,,,, You and your family as a country, a nation ,,,,,, you are under attack and have spent the last of your gold ,,,,,You will print money and continue the effort, no matter the inflationary costs,,,, come what may!

Many nations utterly failed to return to the original gold standard simply because they were mostly tapped out from the war. At the best, the richer, surviving countries would have taken a major economic hit by going back into a full gold system. All the eventual gold deals and non- deals
were little more than a part of the progression of events that lead us here today. All in an effort to keep from fully marking to the market the cost of a shared loss in war, defence and other financial failures.

There is not one person among us that ,,,,,,,,, if their family was completely broken from the war experience ,,,,,,,,,, would have asked for a return to gold. In full a honest context, millions would have starved in the process. The world optioned to share the loss and spread it out as far and as long as possible.

The war experience is but one example of why society has such a hard time with an official gold system during times of stress. Over and over again we have seen where gold is the very best holding and defence against private and public financial loss. Yet, when large scale national loss
threatens society as a whole ,,,,,, it's always the money system that receives the brunt of the demands for change. Society demands that whatever money system is in place at the time of stress, be shifted so as to spread the burden amongst all. Is it right,,,,,, is it just,,,, I do not think so. But it is what we do and have done for a long time!

Today, if gold can be forced out of the official money system, it will be to the benefit of everyone during times of stress in the future. In times of war people spend the legal tender in commerce. Yet they save the food, liquor and necessities. A common currency of the world would be just such a necessity to hold as part of your wealth.

To Trail Guide
I think I am beginning to understand.
First of all, if the gold price is freed from the $USD, monetary discipline will re-assert itself relative to all fiat currencies.

Hello Cavan Man,
You write my words:
-------This one sentence of yours tells me quite a lot; "In our modern world, we must remove gold from the official money system, place it in a free market, and people will use it as wealth money, not borrowing money. Then fiat can come and go as the wind."------

TG:
The above is my point in it's most simple form. I word it this way in an effort to engage ORO in one of the many aspects of our modern gold world.

------------
Second, fiat currency is for convenience only and is now truly represented in proper context for all the world to see; all of its weaknesses and limitations are manifested in the relationship between a particular genus of fiat and the POG. If it can come and go as the wind then truly, one should hold equity and wealth in gold and not fiat; exposure to the medium should be minimalized as is prudent.
------------

TG:
In it's most basic form, the beginning concept of gold money saw it as only one of many wealth items people held on their shelf. We traded anything and everything back then,,,, as all wealth was tradable money. Gold became the dominant circulating wealth money because of it's many unique qualities.

----------
Third and perhaps most importantly, the personal gold standard that Aristotle speaks so eloquently of from time to time still continues to assure an individual's right to and desire for honest money. A personal gold standard in the context you espouse will and should encourage and promote the realization that gold is indeed the money and wealth of the ages. Gresham's law will keep fiat relegated to a small percentage of one's net worth as it is mine now. --------------------------

TG:
Somewhat yes, CM! We can trace gold's first troubles,,,,,, back to when it was made an official currency that one could borrow and lend. This entangled it into the human emotions of fraud and cheating. I don't dispute (and completely encourage) the fact that real gold,,,,,, stamped into coins and circulated as such,,,,,,, is the correct form of world money. The problem comes in that "modern society" (as opposed to perhaps 19th century society) will never let an official money just circulate without manipulating it.

If gold is the only currency in circulation (in paper or coin form) our modern world demands that we borrow and lend it to service human functions. In this realm, we have and do change it's true format as our stress requires. However, if gold can circulate in coin form ,,,,, and traded on a world
physical freemarket,,,,,, without legal tender status,,,,,, it will become a perfect background currency for all mankind. Let the various governments stamp it as they now do in Maple Leafs, K-Rands, Eagles,,,,,, (especially relevant are the old world gold coin long in circulation prior to these modern ones) even call it "non binding Legal Tender" or place a ficticious low LT price on it. But, most importantly destroy the banking aspects of gold and let it all trade for physical settlement only.

In this ages old format, it evolves backwards into a wealth asset that once again projects all the fine qualities of circulating real wealth,,,,, and does so without the entangling alliances of contract legalities inherent in a gold standard. Truly in this old format, Central Banks, governments, citizens will all be able to use gold,,, side by side with fiat currencies. In this position, any official will quickly see how "more gold" held in reserve becomes a defacto backing for national moneys,,,,,, instead of
competing with them. Of course, the relative rarity of gold will force it's currency price sky high. But, in this position, it will quickly become "the dominate currency asset" that values all other circulating fiats. This position negates the desires of society to manipulate it while utilizing it's ages old purpose of holding wealth in a way that transcends time.

We are today, heading towards the trading of freegold,,,,, and the ECB is laying the political software for it. For better or worse we will ride this river of change to the sea.


Also: Elwood, is this more clear? Read it quickly as ORO is putting on his largest boots to grind it down (smile).

Good day ORO,
Because your ORO (02/15/00; 05:14:21MDT - Msg ID:25372) is on this page and easily found, I will not completely re post it.

I believe that you have still not challenged the thrust of my argument. That being:
------Today, in our modern society,,,,,, no form of any national currency system will be left unmanaged. Be it a full gold system or a fiat system, society will expand it (inflate the currency through the loan process) or shrink it (deflation through uncontrollable stress default). As soon as the system in place bumps against it's natural or manmade limits, society will option to change those limits. Without
fail.---------

You write:
----------------------------------
ORO
Under a gold standard and the debt dollar standard as well, the existence of a lender of last resort in one substantial country will cause all international banks to lower their rates or minimum credit rating to make use of the guarantees of that lender of last resort - If they had not, the banks of the country with a lender of last resort would have forced them out of the markets during the boom. This is as much the case today as it was during the turn of the previous century.

For reference in reading the comments below, this note:
Booms and busts do occur. Debt bubbles occur without government sponsored cartels. What is different is the following:

1. Early failure. The non-central bank gold standard produces a small crash after 4-5 years of overextension. This is long before a gold debt boom made possible by a central bank and government sponsored bank cartel would have fully developed.
----------------
Trail Guide (TG):
How true! But this does not address the aspects of society control in our modern world. We will not allow any system to contract after a 4-5 year overextention. Any "small crash" today,,,,,, if using a gold standard,,,,,,would be countered with an immediate devaluation of the currency (raise
the nation's, official price of gold) so as to allow the boom to continue. Outside of that remedy ,,, and the loss of currency prestige it would entail,,,,,,, we would just dump the gold system entirely.
Not my idea of sound operation, but it's what society does today.
--------------------

2. The scale of debt. The natural dynamics of the free banking business is towards caution. By disabling the market's tempering mechanism (it functions through the specie money supply), the cartel can push debt to 15-20 years. The resulting scale of debt would be some 8 fold larger, because the rollover game made possible by the government cartel and the presence of a lender of last resort.
--------------
TG:
In a natural dynamic what is the greater fear,,,,,losing your banking capital or losing your banking franchise? There is no method of disabling a markets tempering ambitions. We have not outlawed fear, greed, fraud or war and conflict with each other. Today, if it's official, it's open for negotiations and rule changes.
--------------------

3. The weeding out of weak business. Weak businesses are weeded out much earlier than under a central bank regime.
-----------------------
TG:
As above, society today has a way of tolerating it's weeds and always says "oh, let's help them out for a while ,,, it' only just these few weeds". Soon, the boom is on!
----------------

4. Who benefits. The key motive of a cartel is the elimination of competition by means other than fair competition on the merits of the corporation. The best cartel to have is that of banking. The bank cartel allows endless losses during the establishment of the cartel, until the competition is destroyed. One familiar example to the goldbugs is Barrick. Their growth through the use of
hedging was very rapid, much more so than any other gold company starting out at their size in the mid 80s.
----------------

TG:
I agree! But when you have a nation that loves "Las Vegas" and all that represents,,,,,,, buys dot.com stocks and trades stock options,,,,,,they also enjoy the soap operas of these cartels. Hell, they buy into them, no less! ORO, with this mindset, no nation will tolerate the discipline of having gold as their official money. Yes, it's my loss,, your loss,,,,,,all of our loss!

But,,,there is another way! And it will politically work because it builds on the desires of this mind set, while offering an escape route. You are reading my posts, yes?
-----------

5. Who Pays. The failures of the centrally controlled bank system are swept under the rug and reappear in the form of fresh loans coupled with monetization. In the case of monetization, the "good" securities are purchased by the central bank, adding to the monetary base. The additions to
the monetary base are leveraged through the bond markets and the banks into a price rise that swindles the saver of the purchasing power of his funds.
------------------

TG:
Absolutely! But, remember, this is the same format we have been using for 20 years now. Everyone shares the loss through currency inflation (not price inflation yet) as they try to jockey for position. Yes, in the end (one that is coming soon) the entire system fails and most everyone loses
totally (at least in dollar based assets). But return to gold? No they won't!

However, place gold in a format where everyone can watch it run,,,,,then they will reach for it,,,, outside their fiat world. In doing so an ages old process begins that will clean the dirty currency pipes without making laws to enforce it.

You are the best ORO! We will all hike this gold trail to the sea and see all we can see.

Cavan Man and others, later!

ORO, Journeyman, All,
I enjoy this conversation, and will continue right along your debate line. But, your question,,,which way do you think they are going as far as mechanism (ref the options
above)?,,,,,,,, it will be outlined on the Trails page. I will again be writing there as FOA and this time things will be more in order. It needs to be because events do seem to be proceeding faster now.

Note:
I think ABX brought their calls as a "position strategy" put in front of their "intended" buying in of real gold to close some forward sales. They were going to make some hay on any gold spike from their actions,,,,,,but later were shocked to find that no official gold was forth coming! It seems that the Washington Agreement had larger teeth than anyone expected. Even their "well connected" board could not open these doors. So, they put a New York spin on the story! Is this a fact? We will know before long!
Readers should follow the reality here, all forms of paper gold derivatives (gold stocks included) are in good supply ,,,,,, bullion is not! The discount on coins does in no way
present the true picture of the physical market.

It seems that Goldfields SA understood this well in front of everyone. They were the first to buy gold at the BOE auction, close out their shorts (most of them) and even held long paper gold. Progressive thinking one would expect from the best. (Yes, for anyone here that remembers, I took a position in them in support of their actions and burned the shares. Never to be sold. My wife may sell after I'm gone, no doubt (smile))
Many other mines and Bullion Banks are now visibly caught in this transition and will have to quickly
struggle for position before the next "rule changes" are implemented. No, I don't know the what or when yet, but something is clearly in the works and the major players are creating uneasy feelings that are spooking some people (including some lesser mine leaders). The paper prices could easily swing wildly either way here.

Obviously, I expect some further curtailment of bullion supplies. However this could be in the context of "buy side curtailment". We shall see.

My feelings are,,,, as always, the best way for one to participate in this is with physical gold first in line, as the majority metal holding. If one is concerned about privacy then stock registration is out and indeed, bar registration violates the same ,,,,, then the old country coins are the best.

Later (on Trails) I'll go back and discuss things like Why $280 was important,,, and Why the intentions of oil including gold in their settle mix,,,,, and in general clear up many lose ends.
So, now back to working on the debate!

Hello Journeyman:
Just read again your post of: Journeyman (02/15/00; 11:10:43MDT - Msg ID:25391)
Good post!

You write:
-----But a bank, especially a central bank, is part of the extended order, and as Hayek suggests,

(TG note: I'm adjusting Hayek's quote to simplify)
" " " If we were to apply the unmodified, uncurbed, rules of the small band or troop, or of, say, our families to our wider civilization,,,,,, as our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make us wish to do, _we would destroy it_."
AND
" " " Yet if we were always to apply the rules of the extended order [Note: as Journeyman would put it,,,,trade with those we don't know face-to-face ] to our more intimate groupings, _we would crush them_." " "
AND
" " " So we must learn to live in two sorts of world at once. To apply the name 'society' to both, or even to either, is hardly of any use, and can be most misleading" "

F. A. Hayek, _THE FATAL CONCEIT The Errors of Socialism_

Now Journeyman writes:
----------The bank treats us, not as part of their "small band or troop," but rather as part of their "extended order" (and rightly so) when times are good ---- we'd better pay up or there goes the ranch. But when they're in trouble, they want to be bailed out, treated by us now as if they were
part of our small band or troop, or now that they're really big and might cause the whole neighbourhood to burn, treated as "too big to fail."-----------------

Trail Guide:
Good point Journeyman! BUT (smile)?? It's always easy to place the failings of a nation,,,,,, a company,,,,, a small group or even a families finances upon some "other extended order". We read a lot about this in the general media (and on the web), but I question just how much of this is in
moral reality.

When referring to how some large entity (big banks?) did them in,, people often camouflage their own emotions by presenting only their side. What if the tables were turned,,,,, and these "small band" victims were in this "extended order" driver's seat themselves. We already know the answer as to how the majority would act. They would fight for their "most profitable" best interest,,,,,,, right
or wrong! Sad, but true.

----It's a great life in this here great lands we call these United States" -- Mr. W. Rogers---

This is the "dirty little secret" that many of the most outspoken hide. And,,,, they play out this hidden fact at the voting booth in a democracy. Yes, they "privately" vote for anyone that will protect their "financial position" whether it's moral or not. Then we "publicly" shout about how this "extended order" is doing us in ,,,, but, it's exactly what "we" as a "small band" would do to them.

This is the reason I don't buy the "two worlds occupying one" in a democratic society. The people in power are a reflection of us. Go to small-town anywhere in the US and put "us" up there,,,, and "them" down here,,,,,, and nothing would change. Yes, I know that's not true 100% of the time as there are some fine solid people out there. But,, I bet at least 90% of the time. Yes?

This is why,,,,,, in my Freegold posts to ORO I use Society as a term to express the financial drives of the whole. "We is them", my friends,,, my neighbours!

Further:

(note: to gain context of this please read his post)
You write:
-----The writing of IOUs, that is, lending, is unavoidable, and when done "correctly," is good. (There is "consumer debt," which except for rare instances is in the long run inherently "bad," and "commercial debt" which is good or bad based, ultimately, on whether or not it increases
productivity.) But how are you going to stop Uncle Joe from writing an IOU and using his gold sovereign as collateral?--

TG:
When gold is trading in a free physical market,, outside the currency perception,, Uncle Joe can use his "Swiss 20 Franc Helvetia's" all he wants for collateral in a currency loan. In this context gold is no different from any other item of wealth we own. Be it a car, house, furniture or a
petroleum cracking unit in a "Texas City Texas refinery ,,,,,, we are borrowing the fiat currency not the item of wealth.

As long as gold is "ideally" implicated as some form of "official money", modern society will try to lend "it" (the gold) and borrow "it" (the gold). Then it becomes part of the debt itself and is entangled in all kinds of ,,, "oh where am I going to get the gold to pay off this loan",,,,, issues! This throws it right back into the arena of "currency manipulations" by officials,,,,, all in an effort to maintain the economic momentum. The very same thing we are into today.

Again, today gold still carries the baggage of past associations with "official currency / money schemes of yesterday year. As time has progressed, and our economy has developed, each passing stage of using gold in the official money / currency mix has become more convoluted. As I noted to ORO, it's a shame we cannot just use gold,, outright,, but modern society has proven that it will never leave it alone.

We have evolved to a point where no one,,,, gold bankers, gold miners, politicians or private savers even knows what the term "today's gold market" really means! We have distorted the physical gold market to the point that the trading of "paper contracts",,, that have virtually no call on real gold (ABX cash settle calls as example??) price the supply and demand of real gold. All in an effort to keep the dollar looking good. And do we blame them for doing it?

Think about it,,,, prior to the birth of another possible currency system (Euro),,,,,, looking from 1990 backwards,,,, the amount of economic loss that would have been associated with a dollar failure made the minor loss of killing the gold industry look,,,,, well,,,, like nothing! Kind of like sending in your best troops to be mowed down,,,,all to build time to assemble a full army.

Thanks for discussing Jman,,,,,,, I have more for Cman and ORO later.

Hello again ORO,

ORO (02/15/00; 16:45:38MDT - Msg ID:25407)

You write:
------The electronic systems will carry the day.-----------

Your Point-------
Eventually they will switch to a free gold banking system

Your Why------
because the fraud of the bank-government-Cabal's fiat money system leaches too much from commerce, and now that electronic free markets have no barriers to entry left, it is on the verge of total collapse. ------Whether the Cabal survives or not turns on Cabal member's acceptance of the
reduced position left to them. ------So far, they have attempted to stretch their current position as far as possible - and then some. They are taking what they can out of the current structure and massively moving their holdings of old and new economy corporations onto an unsuspecting public full of enthusiasm. A last effort at one more fleecing of the flock.----------

TG:
ORO, I have a hard time accepting the present currency system as a independent Cabal. Even in the context of viewing it as some small part of US government structure. Yes, they are a political block and their policies can be applied to them as an acting whole (FOA's "Dollar / IMF
faction"??). But as a "extended order" type cabal, operating on their own? Consider that every US citizen has a personal share in this structure that many of them have voted for themselves. Just as in my post to Journeyman, we must accept that the entire dollar reserve system has tied all of us to it's fate as much as we tied it to ours. None of us had to go into debt, overspend or use a non- energy efficient product structure. We as a people optioned for the most financial rewarding lifestyles,,,,, not the most moral ones!

Trying to go back and pick the points of where the "Cabal" crossed a line of no return ,,,, that made us all "go with the flow" begs the question: "When did everyone stop voting?" (smile)

You write:
------Trail Guide - you obviously understand the issues as they are, yet you claim that there is a "society" willing to take upon themselves their own fleecing.--------------

TG:
No, we turned the cheek as we agreed to fleece each other for the good of the system. All the while holding private emotions that somehow each of us could jockey for financial position while the others were not looking! What else could explain the insane rush into all forms of financial derivatives. No one is chasing this leverage for nothing. The "Western Mission Statement" says that our dollar, free enterprise system is the greatest,,,, let's keep it going,,,, but please let me make my million before anyone "responsible" exposes it for what it is,,,,, and shuts it down!

---------Obviously, you include government and banking as part of this "society", ---------- and point out that they had in the past, and still have the upper hand and will be able to impose their fiat money on us for the foreseeable future.-----------

TG:
Too a degree, yes! I covered this in a post today to Journeyman. We are to a point now where the governing powers cannot turn back. You, I and many here understand the dangers,,,,and openly discuss it, but most do not and will not. If we (from my end) have any purpose at all it's
not to stop this "irresistible force",,,, rather, to better light the trail before us. My contention, as an American, it that our dollar fiat currency will continue through out out lifetimes. In an substantially lower value and international use mode,,,,,,, but be in existence never the less.

ORO, our entire society structure was built on this dollar and we will slowly slide with it's inflationary fall. We will not just shift out of it,,, especially on a downhill run. Look at many of the third world countries that still locally use their almost worthless moneys, but use dollars in a parallel economic world. We will eventually do the same. Read Travlers 2nd post here The Traveler
(1/28/2000; 1:30:27MDT - Msg ID:23712),,,,,'see the part under "Now for new business -----" beautiful! It gives a good perspective.

You write:
------ You are arguing that the fiat system is unresponsive to the fact of its own inefficiency reducing long term growth by an enormous margin - by half as far as I can calculate the effect. Alternately, you are making the argument that the system does not reduce efficiency but is
necessary for growth. ---------------- I know that the fiat system is not capable of increasing the growth of output. It imposes a transfer of resources from producers to government, banking, and related interests and reduces the resources available for producers to further produce and for the global community to raise standards of living. The fiat system is a negative sum game and the free economy is a positive sum game. Their connection together produces less wealth than is possible without fiat.---------------------

TG:
We shift gears here and talk about the Euro system. We have to differentiate between a brand new reserve fiat currency and an outgoing one that has been aged from debt and it's constant attempted alignment with gold. Of course the Euro has all the bad qualities you mention,,,,,, but so did the dollar at the beginning! Are we comparing apples and oranges?///// No. Just as you posted earlier, the dollar was never on a traditional gold system. And even during most of the time it was,,,,,,, the world financial structure would not hold still.

Yet, the US economy did incredible things and did it using a constantly evolving ,,,,,,"in reality mostly fiat",,,, financial system. Yes, we robbed our citizens of productive efforts (including gold) to do it,,, but "in much of our beginnings" ,,, as a whole it worked well enough to give us a major world standard of living. The same thing is going to somewhat happen in Europe. And their gold system may end up as the best yet!

…
Now for new business -----

Steve Hickel's macro viewpoint by and large mirrors our profile (Yes, we predict that the Euro, warts and all, will become in time the primary reserve currency. The permutations of this eventual reality offer prepared capitalists many prosperous opportunities). Naturally, most innocents will dismiss Mr. Hickel's viewpoint on a day that the Euro fell 1% verses the US$ and by almost 20% YOY.

Less understood by many gleeful goldmeisters of the Americas and Japan is the calamitous fallout from this eventual reality. Simply put, dollarized economies will go the way of Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia and Russia to name but a recent few as the world goes to the Euro and a free market in physical gold. Consider this basic equation:

Now: US$ 300 = E$ 300 = 1 ounce AU = 15 barrels of crude = 1 man's new suit

Eventually, after the US$ devalues internationally and hyperinflates domestically in order to find its intrinsic equilibrium (Read: true value), the equation will look much like this:

Later: US$ 3,000 = E$ 300 = 1 ounce AU = 15 barrels of crude = 1 man's new suit

The US$ variable is largely controlled by foreigners who each will decide their affection for the many US$ that they have endlessly accumulated for the goods and services that their sweat has produced.

The equations state that holders of dollar paper claims (particularly creditors and common shareholders) will become poorer as the US$ devalues internationally and hyperinflates domestically while holders of E$, gold, crude or other hard assets will experience no increase or decrease in their current purchasing power. In certain circumstances, however, those prepared for this calamity will reap a significant increase in their net worth. Read this again and give it more thought. Its a key to understanding your financial future if you hold significant dollar denominated paper claims.

More specifically, suppose I owe the holder of my residential mortgage US$300,000 (or the equivalent Now of 1,000 ounces of AU or 15,000 BO). If I bought 100 ounces of physical AU Now, I could Later sell my AU at $3,000 per ounce and payoff my mortgage. I am ahead (for I received a $300,000 house for $30,000 in gold) while my creditor is behind for it received in full satisfaction of my mortgage 10% of the purchasing power that it originally lent to me. Thanks to the US Supreme Court for supporting FDR's fraud by striking the "gold clause" from debt instruments in its decision dated 2-18-35 (294 U.S. 240, 55 S.Ct.407). This only works if you have a fixed rate mortgage or a floating interest rate with a contractual or statutory ceiling.

Similarly, my oil well will payoff my mortgage Later with only 1,500 BO. The next 15 BO will still buy just one man's suit.

Aggregate this to the many mortgages and other loans held by banks, insurance companies, GE Credit, Ford Credit, your money market fund and the like. As a result of outright defaults (I need my all of my salary to buy food - a sirloin steak Later will cost $100 per pound) and payoffs by the prepared, their capital ratios will evaporate and many will go insolvent. This means that the common shares held in your IRA, 401(k), pension plan and so forth are now nearly worthless.

As a holder of paper claims (CDs, bonds, annuities) against these financial intermediaries, you will receive 100% of your principal back (in the best case) but it will have 10% of its former purchasing power. Yet a suit now costs $3,000 not $300. Thus begins the death spiral of the dollarized economies.

My last comment for this post considers the impact on gold mining shares as the Euro gains acceptance and physical gold trades as settlement alternative in a free market. FOA has essentially stated that these unique organizations will experience a unique set of adjustment problems (nationalization, confiscation of their production two name but two). Thus they will not be fruitful investments. While I agree with their share value at the end, I differ somewhat in their value while in the process of getting to the end.

We believe that as gold triples from US$300 to US$ 900 on its way to (pick your number), unhedged gold producers - not exploration companies - which have fixed rates or capped rates of interest on their mine loans will experience a 10 fold or better increase in their share prices. However, Later the share prices will sink below their price Now due to government theft. Holders of such shares could also payoff their mortgage or other secured debt for a fraction of the purchasing power originally received if they sold soon enough.

I am exhausted as I am certain you are if you made it this far. Thanks for your indulgence. Perhaps I will post again soon.

Best regards to all.

Hello Elwood,

You write:
----- During the few times in history in which man has chosen this path, great leaders have arose to lead them there and thence out again once the danger has passed. Wherefore are such leaders today? Are the spirits of Jefferson and Jackson truly dead?---------------(and)--Was
Freeman Tilden truly correct when he wrote the following in his book, "A World in Debt"? "Nothing, has been more amply demonstrated during the past three thousand years than this: that the great majority of men do not esteem, or understand, or even desire personal liberty. What they value is the semblance of liberty accompanied by indulgence."-----

TG:
Oh boy, Tilden said it right,,,,, "semblance of liberty accompanied by indulgence"! This very aspect of modern life is clearly visible in our money systems today,,, and will most likely be the norm for some time.

It's one of the reasons I brought up Freegold,,,,,, so we can all air our feelings and perceptions about money and life,,,,,, past and present. I submit that most goldbugs are not preparing themselves for the trail ahead. "Reality",,,, in today's context is that the world is going to use a fiat
system for the foreseeable future,,,,, come what may.

If we can understand the impact a currencies "timeline" has on it's value, we can position ourselves to dodge "at least" the "worst effects" of that speeding truck you speak of.

You write:
------Haven't you, yourself, argued that our entire standard of living is but an illusion based on that robbery of others?---

Yes,,,, AND eventually??,,,,, or perhaps most likely??,,,, the fiat Euro will also create the same illusion of wealth that the dollar has given today. But, the size,,,,,, scope,,,, perception of that wealth illusion is most evident at the end time of a currencies life,,,,,, not the beginning.

This is one of the reasons my friends question the over dependence,,,,,, the over positioning of ones wealth in dollar based wealth and gold derivatives for this transition. For myself, it amasses me what a difference there is from Western perceptions and much of the rest of the world. In America, for instance,,,, investors know little about the true need for "real gold" and put perhaps
10% into it at best. And even little of that position is real metal. Major private players elsewhere consider 30% a good mark for our present time. It used to be 90% (talking about the hard money portion of ones overall wealth) of our (American view) metal holdings was in derivatives with 10% in metal. In the 70s that meant gold futures and mining stocks as the paper portion and 7% silver, 2% gold and 1% other as hard metal. Today, many do the same thing and also "trade" extensively, thinking it's the way to catch up. What they do not realize is that the mechanics of the entire "gold market" as we know, it has changed dramatically. The risk today is that the whole gold market place,,, and all the equity structure that depends on it,,,,,, will fail and shut down as the dollar reserve currency system suffers the first (and largest portion) phases of it's long term
downward drift.

In ground reserves (ore),,,,, future delivery against contract gold,,,,, cash delivery against contract gold and it's implied later purchase of gold on the open market,,,,,, will all be discounted heavily in a mad scramble to exit dollar assets.

This recent paper evolution of our gold market is the natural, end result of an old dollar / gold relationship being mutated in an effort to prop up and extend our dollar system. Once this strategy was / is abandoned, it will collapse with and before the dollar,,,,,, and in doing so "take out" the perceived "equity in almost every gold derivative asset.

This is the reason why many major private gold investors today believe physical gold will far outrun all of it's modern contemporaries,,,,,, and do so by a huge amount. As such we (that's me too) now place 95% (again this is the hard asset portion of their overall wealth) of their hard
money in physical "gold" only! I not only expect gold to keep up with any hyperinflation of the dollar,,,,, but out- pace even that ,,,,,, by a large amount!

This position was promoted and considered very radical only a few years ago. Today, many are reconsidering it. Again, on the Trail I'll build quite a foundation to support this view.

Thanks Trail Guide

Hello Farfel,
I bet this tops your story:

From Bill Fleckenstein's site ----------

In the mania chronicles... A reader who is a rep for a discount broker in Toronto sent in the following:

"A couple of crazy calls today reminded me of how ridiculous everyone has become.

"One client asked me for a quote, giving me the symbol of the stock. He then asked me to check his account to remind him how many shares he owned. I didn't recognize the symbol and asked him the name of the stock (I can get it from the quote screen but it takes a couple of extra steps). He
replied that he didn't know the name of the stock, only the symbol.
Remember, he already owned the stock. Next we went on to another quote. This time he asked me if I could tell him what that company did. I checked a couple of news releases and told him it sounded like they were involved in faxes over the Internet. That was all he needed to hear, and he bought 100 shares at market.

"Another call today was from a client who wanted to buy some "aec.wt". I set up the buy and started to repeat it back to him before releasing it. I read the full name - including the word \`warrants' - and then asked him if he was sure it was the warrants he wanted and not the actual trust units. I could tell he didn't know what I was talking about, so I explained to him what the warrants were. They were basically worthless and due to expire in March. At least he caught on quick and decided he didn't want them after all. I was
almost encouraged, but then he just went and bought some other penny crap. Oh well."

----------------The LBMA(London Bullion Market Association) recently reported a 22% decline in physical trading activity for the first month of this year. The average value of gold transfers fell to $6.3 billion from $8.1 billion in december. If this acute decline in physical trading volume continues, it is not hard to imagine the wheels coming off of the bullion dealer's machine.-----------------

Also:
--------A short squeeze caused by a contraction of credit among and for the gold intermediaries, the bullion dealers, is on the horizon. ------------

Also:
---------Still, each new rise in the price of gold is being
greeted with cries from the bearish camp that physical
demand is falling away. But the bullish case for gold calls
for the crowding out of physical buyers by short covering
and investment buyers.---------------

Also:
-----Gold is a currency, a monetary reserve asset and a credit instrument in the way it has been utilized by bullion dealers.------------------


Also
-------Apocalyptic expectations are unnecessary to project a dollar gold price that includes four digits. It will only require the inevitable unwinding of bearish producer and dealer hedge structures amidst a change of market perceptions on the desirability of financial assets.

Freegold
http://www.the-privateer.com/gold6.html#latest


Boy,,,,, the privateer is now hitting right on some of the discussion we have been having here. See his whole post,,, good site.

His words:

----------And Gold's history as a tradable financial asset only really goes back to the "floating" of world currencies in early 1973. --------------

TG:
As the whole gold / currency entanglement threatened our economy and began to come unglued,,,,, they just did what we have been talking about. Instead of setting gold free to trade as a physical asset alone, it was turned into a "financial asset". This exposed it to all the lending,
borrowing and derivative entanglements.

Most every thinker from that time to present uses that period to mark the beginning of Freegold trading,,,, what really happened was far from this. Gold never did become freely traded in the perceived context of just buying and selling gold alone. In parallel to the physical market a
paper market grew that eventually set the price for buying and selling Freegold,,, physical gold. In this respect, gold never did detach from the currency markets. Official policy could still be used to control it's price, therefore making the dollar look good,,, and extend it's life. Yes, one could buy gold, but it's price was marked to the fiat currencies no different than when it was part of the money system. The only difference was that the private market makers provided the hardware (various paper gold derivatives) while the Official markets provided the software (keeping gold lending rates well below currency market rates with the use of small actual sales and "grey" guarantees to supply if needed). In addition this played on the publics ("society") perversion to sell their "hard" , fully paid for" gold holdings and hold the newly offered "soft" (leveraged with less cash on deposit) paper gold. As such the "gap" (physical deficit) has been filled from old private holdings. Holdings that are / were much larger than the CB stash. This supply fact is largely backed up by looking at the gold holdings of "ALL" Central Banks over the last ten+ years. The actual average amount of CB gold hitting the market was never enough to cover the deficit. Not even close. Mostly, other CBs (and large entities) brought the offered gold.

This is the period that low gold prices were,,,, allowing some entities a recycle their dollars back into gold without impacting the price. Some used the paper gold function while others used actual hard gold buys. Oil is good example. In return for the worlds "official policy" oil production was kept high and prices low. Even in the face of a demographic growth in oil use that should have driven prices much higher. In reality, these low prices were backing the dollar reserve system with cheap oil,,,, settled in dollars only.

Cheap gold,,,, cheap oil and World CB support has been used to maintain and extend the dollar reserve system until another currency was available. Today, one is. It's no accident that one year after the Euro was born:

,,,,,,,We find oil prices steadily rising to match it's true economic relationship to world economic growth and use.

,,,,,,,We find the Euro becomming more and more of a financing preference.

,,,,,, We find oil production unresponsive to US demands. Even hinting to cut supplies further!

,,,,,,,We find this modern two tier gold marketplace,,,,,,, built from the mid seventies,,,,,, being abandoned ,,,as it's useful purpose to support the dollar is no longer needed. The Washington Agreement will be seen as only the first of many changes.

,,,,,,,We find the dollar driven into a more overvalued position as world dollar use and therefore liquidity begins to dry up. Prompting the US Fed to pump the money supply in an effort to replace international dollar reserves. We have but to look at Japan and it's Yen to see a similar situation. Here a nations currency is constantly driven upwards,,,,, not from the value of economic function
,,,, rather from financial destruction. Even now the BOE takes steps that may lead to major (hyper?) inflation. Our fate acted out on a much smaller scale? Is this the reason Another said that the dollar would rise first,,,, before it's end, and gold's beginning?

,,,,,,,,We hear talk in Euroland (German citizens) that it's not that their Euro and gold have fallen,,,, rather it's that the dollar has created a US financial bubble similar to Japan in the late 80s,,,, and this crisis is driving the dollar and it's financial sector into a mania. Perhaps an hyper mania?

Also from the Privateer:

-----------Gold has always been a great boon to the world's economic prosperity. And for that precise reason, it has always been a great threat to government created and administered financial systems. ---------------

TG:
To date, if physical gold supply is further curtailed,,,,,,if physical gold demand rises,,,,,, it's price will do so independant of the paper marketplace. This will destroy the modern dollar supporting two tier gold market. A market created to extend the system, not maintain it indefinitely.

In addition I add that governments can,,, have,,, and do use gold to their best interest if the strategy is to unseat an established but failing money system. We shall see.

Also:

-----It is an "asset class" (like stocks, bonds, and "cash") but it cannot be controlled. ------------

TG:
The "true value" of physical gold alone could never be controlled. If,,,,physical gold, trading as Freegold can again act as it did in the very beginning. It will perform it's wondrefull function outside the official money arena,,,, it becomes what it really is,,,,,, an "asset class" as wealth money. A wealth asset,,,,, not an unworkable financial asset.


Also:

-----What has and is being controlled are Gold DERIVATIVES. And as long as the demand for physical Gold can be met, the price can be controlled by the use of these derivatives. -------

Also:

----Since 1980, the demand for PHYSICAL Gold has never got out of hand, and the use ofderivatives to control the price has been developed to its present level. -------------


TG:
Something the world is "on the road" to changing today.


Also:

------The problem now is that unlike most other financial derivatives, which can be "settled" merely by the issuance of more debt paper or, in a final extremity, by the printing of actual currency, Gold derivatives rest on PHYSICAL Gold, which is in finite supply.---------------

TG:
Truly the weak link in dollar support that Euroland will break.

Cavan Man,
Not too many logs my friend(smile), I have to leave. Last post for today.


Hello Aristotle,
You are right about Ted Butler. I truly thing he and many other traders are a generation that grew up thinking that paper trading of all kinds is equal to the real thing. Yet, look around us,,,,, in reality our whole economic structure is always in the courts fighting over contract clauses someone could not make good on. Rents, leases, buy outs! Even on time delivery of new aircraft often defaults! Just because it's in writing,,,, guaranteed,,,,,, and has good counter party support doesn't mean a contract is the same as "in my hand"! Contracts are just agreements between two parties and mean nothing until concluded.

Far too many players take paper gold as a sure thing. They lost the perception that these items are just a bet on the price change performance, not delivery performance. It was barely real in the beginning and has lost even that early perception now,,,, by a factor of 1,000%. Still, we read of how it's all illegal and "they" are doing us in! Yet, I can place $2,000 down and create a contract for delivery ,,,,,, and that could be all the wealth I have ,,,, period. What's illegal about that?

We usually hear these arguments in court when somebody is losing big. They try their best to match a moral concept against a legal concept and hope the jury is out to lunch (smile). It's the same in Las Vegas,,,,,,, a guy loses big,,,,,, then tries to tell the jury that the house should have stopped him,,,,,, because he didn't know the house rules were established against him winning!

The real answer to all of this is,,,,, "boy don't play these games in their house, if you don't want to lose". Yet, people still gamble the futures and options in gold and get mad when they find out that the rules were always against them. Ha! Ha!,,,, they never cry a moral story when they are
winning???

Same thing today for the gold mine stock holders. How many would have said a word if the paper gold markets were manipulated in their favour??????? Not a word I bet! Yet, still illegal, no?

ALL: They tell this tail for their own advantage. Gold can't rise that much so use leverage ,,,,,, Gold can't rise that much so buy silver ,,,,, Gold can't rise that much so buy gold stocks. Then gold falls,,, they lose over and over from trading in and out and cry it's all illegal ,,,,,, we pack physical in and wait for the world to swing our way and pray for more of this illegal stuff to keep the price down!
Next play ,,,,, gold spikes way up ,,,, crashes the entire paper marketplace ,,,,,, destroying the finances of most mines and players in the process ,,,,,, same cries again ,,,,,,, it's all illegal ,,,,, they forced it too high!!!!! It will never end!

As Another said "Out bet? They can never cover. Because we play "our" game in "their" house"

Also: Aristotle ,,,,, you write, 'I hope I didn't undermine any natural progression of ideas you had planned by tossing this out on the Table too early"
I saw some while back that you had caught on to what was happening. Funny, there is but a very small group, world-wide, that are working on this. I guess thoughts travel through space and time?

Go for it my friend.

Hello Privateer and Welcome!

It seems that a good number of people use your work to argue the "gold game" (often against me). They often send me parts of your thoughts as evidence. After visiting your site (for some time) I can see why,,,,, you have also been following the politics of gold from way, way back, no? You are not alone, I think Michael Kosares was following it from the 2nd day of his birth (big smile)

I present your position, mostly in agreement,,, but add that it is one of many parts of the gold trail we all now walk. If I may, I will post some of your work (with link) in the future?

I did check my recent item and it did include your link. (I got a little nervous and had to check. Thought I put it in, and did.) (smile)

Hello canamami,

You write in your: canamami (02/19/00; 11:37:37MDT - Msg ID:25664)------------

-------The debate concerning the morality of CB gold sales and leasing turns on whether the CB's should convert what I'll call "currency gold" (accumulated when currencies and gold were more intertwined than they currently are, and often the product of expropriation or other governmental
coercion) into what I'll call "multi-use gold" - i.e., commodity and jewelry use, and private savings not denominated in currency terms.----------------
------I believe it is improper for CB's to convert "currency gold" into "multi-use gold". First, this gold represents in a concrete form the accumulated savings of those who created wealth at a time when gold and currencies were intertwined, and thus dumping it on the market for "multi-use" purposes is a method of frittering away past savings. Second, an industry has arisen (i.e., gold mining) based on the premise that the CB's won't place this gold on the "multi-use" market. Therefore, CB gold sales serve to wrongfully destroy the gold mining industry.-------------

TG,
It seems to me that much of the whole argument on gold swings on whether the CBs are indeed dumping gold in the traditional sense,,,, that is, actually selling it into the industrial marketplace. This is much of the real thrust of everyone's discussion. I think it leaves out most of the picture and shrinks our ability to understand what is happening.

If one looks at the world through a long pipe we only see a small amount. It's called a narrow view. Gold thinking has today forever changed as Western people now think they are more educated,,, sophisticated and only need to see what is right in front of them. Put the pipe down and it's amazing what's out there.

Well, it all started many years ago when most investors had never even heard of "forward sales". We all received a good education given by the mining and brokerage industry as to how one should invest in gold,,,, and from this position it's no wonder the price of physical gold is now so easy to control.

The modern gold industry could be compared to a hypothetical "shoe" industry,,,,,

like this:

------Every family was taught that there was much more leverage (and profit) from putting the families finances into buying the shares of companies that make shoes. It seemed that almost everyone would have to buy shoes at one time or another and this demand would certainly drive
shoe prices sky high. In time, thought has indeed evolved. Today our logic dictated as a must that it was even far better for one to buy shoe mining companies than owning the shoes themselves. Slowly, over many years,,,, families held less and less pairs of shoes and more and more company
stocks. Logic moved further until,,,,, they lowered their shoe buying until each family shared only one pair, but owned a bunch of shoe co. stocks. In addition,,,, "indirectly, through third parties" ,,, they owned contracts for the delivery of real shoes. Indeed, this was smarter because their money was invested for a higher return in other areas,,,, and they could always exercise their contracts for more shoes if needed. Especially if "changing times" required the ownership of more than one pair per family.

The future as my evidence for today:

(A). As time and events later proved,,,, things were not as everyone thought. Later in this cycle, it turned out that many of the shoes everyone had contracts for,,,,,, were mostly the product of other families selling their excess shoe holdings. Not the governments selling so much themselves. Worse yet, those shoes had multiple contracts written on them so as to make the delivery impossible. To
cover all those contracts, shoe brokers and companies had gone into OTC and futures exchanges to buy "financial" hedges for shoe delivery. In a twist of logic, even though those hedges could only be settled in cash, these contract buyers figured that at least their "financial book" would be
covered if a shoe default occurred. But this did nothing for all the families that didn't read the small print that said shoe delivery contracts would "through national emergency" or perhaps "security exchange rules",,,,,, also be settled in cash under adverse conditions. Well,,,, most of these very sharp investors accepted even these conditions. They figured that with even a cash settlement, and well before national rule changes,,,, they could pay their taxes on the profits and still buy the shoes in an open market. And using the same logic that placed them in this position,,,,, figured they would buy even more shoes because their cashed in paper leverage gave them more money! Now, after the fact it didn't work out that way. Shoe prices ran ten times faster in the middle of the default settlements,,, so even with some players making 1,000% in cash,,,, shoes were nowhere to be found. If they were found, these cash profits brought even less pairs than if they had put the origional money in them in the first place

(B). Further,,,,, time later revealed that in the late 90s demand for shoes had indeed "skyrocketed", world-wide. Fortunately, many of the people in the Western nations of the world had "brought into" this logic of having only a few pairs of shoes per family and holding their other "shoe wealth" in other paper forms. Some in Dow stocks,,,, some in shoe stocks,,,,, some in shoe contracts,,,, some in shoe derivatives and other options. This effect diverted much of the real shoe demand by spreading out the buying into paper form. It allowed many existing shoes to be diverted overseas where people wanted to get rid of extra dollars and indeed, hold real shoes as their families wealth. Now, after the fact,, we know that the real demand figures from Shoefield
services were completely skewered because they only counted real shoes shipped,,,, not the paper shoes purchased!

(C). Further,,,,,, events later proved that the Central Banks really knew the value of shoes to the world after all. Even during this period, records later proved that the CB mostly sold shoes to each other,,,, with only a small amount (relative to demand) flowing into the real markets. It seemed that they really only rented a very small amount of shoes (relative to demand) to keep the rates down. Perhaps it was the power of suggestion?

All this was in an effort to keep world demand from destroying the "Whole Marketplace" for shoes. This policy was helped enormously as most of the Dollar / IMF banks were more than willing to supply "this paper shoe marketplace they had created earlier",,,,,,,, with paper shoe
commitments because of the profits this created. The CBs saw that "Western investors" would satisfy most of the real demand through their willingness to hold paper shoes,,,,,, and indeed, if shoe prices stayed low,,,, these same investors did indeed,,,, gladly sell their "old shoe bar
holdings" into the huge world demand. Further helping to keep the shoe prices low. All in a effort to give some foreign dollars an illusion of shoe buying power. The rest of the other dollar world,,,, that understood the message being sent by the CBs,,,,, traded their fiat for shoes,,,, over time,,, as able. Now, after the fact,,, they were right. The gold ,,, err err shoes, that is,,,,, they purchased and held in physical shoe friendly government hands more than offset the value lost as the world gold
market fell apart,,,,, taking the dollar with it.

Indeed, it's strange to see that today (year 200?) after the fact,,,,,,, the dollar is still trading,,,,, and still the main currency of the US and a losing holding for many other dollar tied countries. Now, with oil, shoes, goods and services still being sold to them in dollars we now know that talk of dollars being phased out was all wrong! The only thing that changed was dollar asset values and an realignment of world trading structure as it applied to using currency reserves.

Today, most all products brought and sold in dollars are either done in Euros first then changed to dollars,,,, or indexed to the new world Freegold market price. Of course price inflation has virtually destroyed a major portion of the US economic structure,,,,,, rendering it unable to
compete very well world-wide. Indeed, whatever price advantage dollar depreciation gives them, it's completely lost because inflation continues to make production profits non-existent. Slowly, they are using up all their gold reserves in an effort to prop up local industry with profit supports. Still, in time US manufacturing infrastructure will become only a shadow of past glory days.

(D). But time stops for no one,,,, and the shoe market had indeed evolved further. ------ As in all things, greed got the better of the "World gold marketplace" as the ones (banks) that made the market went hog wild creating paper gold for their clients. It seems they entangled every financial facet of the industry into this operation. It eventually became impossible to function outside this new
creation. When the end came, most everyone had had some exposure to the vitality of this paper gold market. When the two tiered marketplace finally failed, it took almost,,,,, "ALMOST" everyone in the industry with it.

What started as an official "grey" policy to keep gold prices low,,,,, had mushroomed into a "we cannot turn back situation"! When it's existence became in the "national interest" of the US (dollar / IMF) we now understand,,,,, because it's failure did indeed rock the dollar world,,,,, not to mention it's old illusion of value. Up until then, dollar assets outside the US had a choice of staying put or
moving into gold as a reserve. But prior to that time society forced the old gold system to fail,,,, so no one could make a good point for returning to a system the world was not willing to live with!

Further, if they did move into gold then, the shock would not only kill the marketplace from where they got cheap gold, it would destroy the function of the world economy because it had no other dollar system to use. So, they supported the dollar and it's gold market even though they didn't like doing it.

(E). Closer to home now,,,,,,, and back from the future::::: This is the broad view.

World political warfare being what it is,,,,, and lasting through out the ages,,,,,, an event has occurred that changed everything in strategic thinking. The Euro was born and became a success!

Now,,,,, this Euro is no dollar, I know,,, and it has many, many problems,,,,, true. But the one thing most people don't understand is just how much political "will" there is out there to escape from the dollar held world. And do it before dollar debt makes it self implode in an inflationary
blaze. Every major world player today, knows that for the last 25+ years we all have lived in a dollar house with a ticking inflation bomb about to go off and burn it down. Every bid of new debt piled ever higher on this system ages it's timeline and takes it one step closer to going off. Yet, it also is trip wired so that if we all exit at once it goes off while we are at the door, leaving many inside. Only recently has an unwired window been found for all of the world (that wants to and can) to escape

On this measurement everyone has completely missed out thoughts. If the Euro proves equal or better than the dollar ,,,,,, good! But, it doesn't have to be even close for most of the world to eventually run to it. They want out from under the dollar system ,,, so bad,, they will eventually
throw caution to the wind to escape it. Understanding this dynamic is key to seeing how the shoe market (gold market ,,, (smile)) is going to evolve. Supply and demand,,,,, legalities and moral truth,,,, fiat moneys verses hard moneys,,,,,, are all nothing in political warfare and national financial self preservation. If gold happens be used as one of many items to help unseat the dollar,,,,,, to
quote from the bible,,,,,, "it shall be done!"

Once the gold market implodes, it will set off a chain of events that will propel investors into using the Euro as a world reserve, come what may. From that time forward any mention of paper gold will be looked at with total disbelief. Anything outside of up front, cash on the head physical trading will be only be found in the back alleys. Euroland will embrace gold with a new physical marketplace that will endorse a bull run in prices like nothing ever seen in modern times. It will not be inflationary anymore than YAHOO stock prices are, precisely because gold will trade as an asset, not a currency. Official BIS / ECB policy will hold that gold is this asset wealth we have been
talking so long about. This is exactly why they now hold it as a asset reserve outside their Euro and mark it to the market. In the future it will be used to settle payments no different than if one gave another Yahoo shares or the deed to their house as debt payment. But, it will no longer contain an official currency function. The political will to control it's price for the sake of world currencies will
be gone.
---------------

So, canamami,,,,,, are the CBs selling gold that -------" " represents in a concrete form the accumulated savings of those who created wealth at a time when gold and currencies were intertwined, and thus dumping it on the market for "multi-use" purposes is a method of frittering away past savings." " ?????? ----
Could be my friend, but there is a lot more to it than that!

I think that by putting down the pipe of narrow vision investors can see that they can participate profitably in a future financial structure,,,,,, but only if they can see the future in a broad sense. Most, " "I say MOST" " of the gold industry will suffer massive dislocation and investor loses. But not all of it. Still the risks are so great (as many such as yourself have found out),,,,,, that the correct
position is having the majority of my hard assets in physical gold and the rest in a very small position of paid up gold shares. Even today we read account after account of sleepless nights and worry over whether ones 100% holdings in mining shares will work out. Desperately hopping that
the stock markets will not crash,,,, and inflation will return before the paper gold market forces prices down one more time,,,,,, and did I make the right move,,,,,and is this the right stock,,,,,, are they really hedged,,,,,,, and will my penny stock last long enough. And all for what?? The hope that the world has not changed and ,,,,, mining stocks will run before gold prices like they did before and ,,,,,, and they won't let me down by only going up at the same rate (or a little bit faster) than much safer bullion?

If ,,,,, " " IF " " what we offer is just a theory as yourself and many other proclaim,,,,,, do you think I am going to be hurt holding a chest of MK's old world coins and just a few mining shares? Truly in this world today,,,,, "a man's just got to know his limitations!" Yes? And you ladies also!

Indeed, had the world been different,,,,,, I think there is not a mining co. leader out there that would not have wished for another outcome. Nobody in their right mind encourages consumers to buy their company stock first, instead of their main product. Had all investors brought physical gold (shoes) first and held a small position of shares for a lifetime (instead of trading), the entire market would have been forced from real physical demand to re-adjust. The lending industry would self destruct long before this. And perversely, too the dollar would have been devalued in gold,,, perhaps changing the future?? We will never know the end of that story.

Having said all of this,,,,,, I am very positive about GATA,,,,, a few mining shares and the prospects of gold coins (and bars) in general. We'll have lots of time on the Gold Trail to see the good side of all of this.

Thanks ALL: for your time Hiking with me!

What do you mean by "paid up gold shares"? Thanks!

TG:
The very best brains for management,,, mines in operation for decades,,, unhedged,,, profitable now and at much lower prices,,, massive reserves going out decades,,, paying a dividend,,, outside the sphere of US / IMF influence,,, likely to have a good relationship with Euroland investors in the future,,, large payroll that supports a big segment of host countries citizens making further nationalization and taxation contradictory to national interest,,, takes world class steps in support of
a physical marketplace!!!!!!

All in all, a company that wouldn't mind if investors brought it without any leverage,,, and did so as an after thought behind ones buying the same bullion product they sell,,,, especially if they (company investors) would only hold for a good long time. -------- Not many around like this,,,, uh? (smile) Yes, they do exist.

Cavan Man,
"Paid up gold shares" belong to investors that have purchased their "very private bullion coins first" as the largest part of their position and still have resources to buy more coins later. Shares amount to a small, but "concrete" portion of our long term hard wealth,,,,,, held with no leverage,,,,,, no sleepless nights! In other words, putting you in control of a successful hard wealth investment plan. One you can live a lifetime with! The secret of the worlds truly wealthy is in their being in control, not how much they have. Each of us has the power to place ourselves,,,,, one on one,,,, eye to eye,,, with the the most powerful. Because it was never how much you have,,, rather how much control you have over your wealth that makes or breakes you.

Most all of us are blessed with the time to build a powerful position, no matter how short our life or how little we make. Unreasonable use of leverage is the "hangman of fools" and "the destroyer of our free spirit".
I'll talk more on this,,,,,, along the trail,,,,, be sure of this!

Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm glad you could come along. My name is FOA. I see a lot of old faces here,,,, and some new. If you are wondering where we are,,,,,, your participating in one of our walks and talks on "The Gold Trail". You're one of many people who take the long drive out of the city to come here. Some say it clears their mind from things that are not real. Whatever the reason, it seems everyone arrives here sooner or later. For myself, I have been hiking this path for a good part of my life. I prefer it here, because from this vantage point we can better grasp how the world works.

None of us are the first, nor will we be the last to take this hike. Over time, various people and nations have been on this path, perhaps going back a thousand years or so. During some periods this same trail was followed right through the main stream of society. While during other times, like today it has tracked far away from the economic illusions in our modern world.

I see most of you have brought your laptops (computers) and cell phones for internet access. Good. We will be looking at charts and things as we go along. Also, one of our rules here is that no one can offer their credentials of track records to each other. Out here we all are the same with no exception. Just real people taking in the world events as they happen around us. Besides, one's past accomplishments and financial success are about what happened yesterday, not tomorrow. And understanding the future is what time on this trail all about. We will only look back at past events and commentary to gain perspective, understand ourselves and find reasoning. A process that helps all of us think more clearly in this world gone mad.

And one more thing before we get started: some of you were asking who I am. And I also heard those city slickers in the back joking about how this was all "so lame". Well, to address the second item first,,,,, more than a few of you slick dudes have left this trail complaining that the hike made their brain hurt worse than the old leg muscles. We'll see if you new ones are still joking after walking a few miles! Oh yes, I see you're wearing hard sole dress shoes. Now that "is" lame! (smile)

Back to the first question: all of you already know me. Just look in a mirror and see for yourself. I'm the butcher, baker and bricklayer,,,,,, doctor, lawyer and the banker. From the Texas oil man to the yardman in Hollywood, I represent the thoughts, feelings and perceptions that many people have, but never express. After we share some time on the trail, many of you may find that most of this understanding and knowledge of FOA was already with to you to begin with. Truly, it was the years of exposure to "Western life" that has obscured our good reasoning.

Mine is also a world perspective that offers thoughts and views as seen though the eyes of others from many lands. Sometimes it's through the eyes of Another. Oh yes, one more thing,,,,, I'm American to the core! "Born in the USA" and still living a "very" private life in my home there.

Onward

We must view the world in a broad context, just as much as in a detail perspective. The larger perception can be just like looking at a river the valley from the ridge above. From far away it's easy to see what direction national trends are flowing. The whole body moves as one, always towards the sea. The problem comes when we get too close and interpret things using only a small river section in front of us. More often than not, the white water we see only hides a deeper flowing truth.

In like sense, national governments and society in general, are the same as those boulders and eddies in the river. Seen up close, they sometimes give the impression that the river is flowing up stream or sideways, when it's only one small section of a larger political will. The same is true in the modern gold markets. The largest part of the river could be flowing in one direction with an unstoppable purpose, but the various swirls and eddies make it look like it's going in circles.

Further

Within every social order, people have conflicting factions that try to dominate the whole. But if one can understand and pinpoint the logic and reasoning of several dominate groups, we can get a grasp for the overall eventual flow. We have seen through out history and in our modern life that the human spirit, most always reaches for and leans towards natural conclusions to ages old problems. There is something in us that makes mankind flow this way. Time and again we build up our emotional will. Then in a great flood we literally overwhelm the branches and rocks that distort our progress through this stream of life.

Today, it seems that the need for this natural flow has been perceived by several of the worlds large groups. We see this in the progress of the gold market to date and is something we have been discussing publicly for several years now. We have given many different perceptions of this changing modern gold market. Each appropriate to it's own period of time. Indeed, they were snapshots of political will,,,, each taken in the context of the moment,,,,, all documenting the evolution of gold as a new force,,, a new player in the world today.

Truly, the stream is being prepared for the great flood that must come, will come!

We rest now

Our most broad view, expressing our strongest position is this: From ten or perhaps twenty years ago a political will, a concept was being formed that would today change the economic architecture and power structure of the world. Within this change, gold would undergo one of the most visible transformations since it was first used as money. We expect that starting three or four years ago, the actual gold market itself, started responding to this sea change. As such, in our time, physical gold will enter the greatest bull phase in it's human use history.

This my friends is the very trail we walk today. During our hikes and fireside chats, we will point out this political will, consider the logic and express our reasoning for this position. All the while, observing the "river current" in the form of events that will soon confirm our view. Indeed, as Another always said, "time will prove all things".

At times we will walk looking backwards, as we pull up many of our old posts and discussions, detailing the whys and what-fors. Why we said what we said, then. I hope these walks will be as interesting for all of you as it will be for me. When not writing here, I can be sometimes seen discussing gold on the USAGOLD forum as "Trail Guide".

And lastly, I wish to thank Mr. Michael Kosares for creating this fine venue. Displaying all of the creative, professional talents of the Centennial group of people, this entire site is a testimony to their forward thinking ability which is so lacking in most precious metals companies. With this in mind and considering our changing world, a relationship with them today will most certainly benefit the investor in the long run. Possibly in a way one may more fully appreciate later. I encourage you to support your future as well as this USAGOLD free site.

"the human river flows for the will of no man,,,, it takes our precious time as it's own
our lives are spent learning how it does pass,,,,, yet it will never know how we have grown"

We walk this new Gold Trail together, Yes? Thank you for reading,,,,,,

A Day Walk

If I had a nickel for every time we thought the dollar was finished, I would have a bunch of nickels! Remember back in the early 80s or even further back into the 70s. All we heard was how the dollar was finished and going to crash and burn. Books about hyper inflation and the need for gold / swiss francs were all over the place.

I read all of them to gain perspective and also acted on some of their advice. Made some money on it too. But even then, something just didn't completely ring true about the whole scenario. Indeed, in hind sight, gold never did return above $800, the dollar didn't hyper inflate and most of the world kept using the dollar as a reserve.

Today, we can more fully understand why so much of that early insight failed to deliver.

True, the dollar was seen as a basket case back then. It had just been pulled from it's gold bond and prices were going up all around us. However, because the world had been on a simi dollar / gold standard, all nations that had previously signed onto using the US buck as their currency reserve now did so with even more resolve. More important, it seamed than using gold itself was out of the question as every country's Central Bank brought dollars as fast as we printed them. The dollar still settled most all trade accounts while dollar reserve buying made an obvious show of support for this world system. No matter how much bad press was offered, they were staying on track and they have continued to do so right up into the 90s!

But all of this flew into the face of what every economist was saying, back then. The common understanding of the era was: if the US didn't stop over printing it's money, we would all experience a major price inflation,,,,,, and no one could stop it! Again, "major" inflation didn't happen and to ask a further question: if the dollar system was so bad, why didn't the world just dump the reserve system and refrain from using it further? In other words, let the dollar be "the US dollar" but don't use it as a backing for your own money system.

Thick Brush Now

Going against the logic of "sound money": through out all the currency turbulence of the 70s and 80s era (including today), the US never did reign in the over printing of it's currency. It continued almost non stop money supply expansion for it's local economy and in addition sent a good portion of it's cash all over the world. On and on the US trade deficit continued to do it's work of feeding ever more US cash into foreign economic systems. We printed paper currency by borrowing it into existence,,,,,, used it to purchase real goods overseas ,,,,,, while foreign governments actively soaked up this dollar flood by expanding their own money supply.

Like this: When you buy an item externally, a dollar is sent overseas to pay for it. Usually, through the world currency trading arena, that dollar is converted into the local currency of the nation which the goods came from. But more often than not,,,,,,, as we print that dollar out of thin air, the foreign government takes the dollar into it's reserve account and prints one of their units for deposit in the local economic system. They do this because: if the foreign CB didn't save the dollar as a currency reserve ,,,,,, and sent it back into the world currency markets to "buy" an existing unit of their money supply,,,,, this action would drive up their currency value vs the dollar and make the price their goods non-competitive in world markets. In other words, a US citizen couldn't use a printed (borrowed) dollar to buy an item for $10.00 that outside the "dirty float" of exchange intervention would cost $15.00.

This is how the "dollar reserve process" inflates the money supply world wide as we (USA) run a trade deficit for our benifit. It keeps the dollar exchange rate higher than it would naturally be thus allowing a US citizen to buy goods at a cheaper price than our expanding money supply and implied currency value would normally dictate. A process in and of itself that invites still more dollars to flow out and purchase still more external goods. Had foreign CBs not taken so many dollars, the ever expanding US money supply would have long ago impacted currency exchange rates and forced a major price inflation internally (in the US). Yes, the major inflation so many saw coming,,, back then,,,,, would have arrived,,,,, then.

So why did these other CBs do it? The standard explanation was that this created a market for their goods here in the US. Yes that's true, but it begs the question; did no one in their land want to buy goods manufactured locally,,,,,, and pay for them with the same printed money supply? Why is it the US could inflate it's money supply to buy cheaper goods externally for no more than the price of printed paper? But, in the same country our paper was sent to, they couldn't print their own currency to buy their own goods? Why couldn't they raise their real standard of living somewhat using the same process like the US,,,,,, and doing so without the burden of inflation or importing foreign currencies?

Again, why would our printed, inflated money movements not create price inflation for us (USA) in goods purchased externally? What if they (foreign goods producing countries) printed an amount of their money equal to the inflow of dollars,,,, but, without holding paper dollars as reserves to back it,,,,, brought the exact same goods from themselves. Common prevalent economic theory says price inflation would result? Or would it? Or better said: why them and not us?

Into the deep woods again

Again, and as above,,,,, In the 70s, it was widely held that the dollar reserve system forced other countries to inflate their local currencies, thereby importing dollar price inflation. But, as time went by,,,,, indeed a decade or two now,,,,,, the same process continued non stop, with no change. It seemed that some "other" countries had found a "new way" to somewhat circumvent the dilemma. Or was this "new way" something sold to them in order to extend the dollar system's timeline?

Many of the lesser third world countries experienced a combination of sporadic hyper inflation and deflation as we forced the dollar reserve system down the throats of their citizens. Their people's living standard constantly fell as they worked ever harder to produce more goods in return for more of our printed dollars. But, instead of using the extra inflow of dollars (positive trade balance) to buy their own currencies in the local system,,,,, thereby keeping their currency strong,,,,, they used that dollar flow as collateral to borrow (from IMF and international banks) more dollars from the world dollar float (mostly called Eurodollars). The lure (or the hard sell) was that they could build up their infrastructure,,, increasing their production efficiencies (human productivity's),,,, thereby raising the national standard of living. Further, they were sold the unneeded idea that even if they didn't completely use the dollar surplus to borrow more, they should hold those dollars in reserve (buy and hold US treasuries) and print more of their own money!

Again, it seemed they had no advocate to push for their own best interest. No one told them that their people already worked cheaply enough to more than offset the competitive loss of a stronger local currency. No one told them that with a strong local currency structure,,,,( that using the dollar surplus to buy their own currency would create),,,,,,,, would allow them to borrow in their own capital markets. A more go slow approach that builds long term benefits. This process would free them from the entanglements of making international debt payments in another money. Indeed, the costs of those involvement's later proved overwhelming!

Now the trail becomes more open

For third world countries their international dollar debt exposure eventually locked them into a servitude to the dollar reserve system. Despite all their natural and human resources, currency involvement had taken a lion share of any productivity increases and increased lifestyle this modern world offered.

However, it did help the cause for the dollar reserve system. By creating an ever growing international debt in dollars, eventual dollar demand to service this debt would only increase. Thereby keeping it's value artificially high. In addition, any left over floating dollars quickly took the form of US treasury debt held in these small countries treasuries. There they were used to further hyper inflate their own currency supply.

For the more developed gold owning countries of the G-7, they had a different question in mind. Again, if taking in inflated dollar reserves was the act of importing US dollar inflation into ones local economy,,,,, and in the process creating a market for your goods overseas,,,, why not just print your own currency without taking in dollars,,,,,, and in doing so give the same buying power the US citizens have in your market,,,,,, to your own people?

If it's not price inflationary to take in part of a world "inflated dollar supply" and create jobs for your people locally,,,,,, why would it be any more inflationary to print your own currency outright? Indeed, why does one need a dollar inflow to legitimize the same money inflation process? That being currency inflation to create jobs?
Why should we (as dollar asset holders) think about this question? Because someone else is and doing something about it today!

Back to a marked trail

Today,,,,,, and after all of this,,,, the dollar never did crash from price inflation. At least nothing like what was expected earlier in the last two decades.

The dollar reserve system was never going to fail then because the major world economic powers were willing to use (waste) all the productive efforts of the worlds people to keep it running. Looking back we now understand the thinking behind this. Without the dollar acting as a reserve, we would have had to go back to a gold system. There was no other currency structure strong enough or deep enough to carry the load.

But, gold had been proven to be much to easy to circumvent as a national or world currency. It seemed human dynamics would never allow an economic system that operated on a pay as you go process without gold debt. If history had proven anything it was that if we have a money,,,, fiat or gold,,,,,, we are going to lend it, borrow it and in the process create debt. Yes, even using gold!

Even if we have a pure gold system, human nature will find a way to turn it into securities. In doing so we will,,,,, come hell or high water,,,,,, lend more gold than we have and borrow more than we can pay back. One has but to return to the history books to see it all in plain print. Over and over again, we start with a solid gold foundation and soon degrade it into trash. It's not just the American way,,,,, it's the world's way.

Because the modern world had progressed into the efficiencies of using high speed digital fiat currencies, no one at that time or today, was willing to crash the whole system by returning to gold. I suspect that the worlds richest would have lost a lot, but so to would "us regular" people. Even with our savings in the form of a "digital illusion", at least we had a job to go to and a dream in our bank account. Removing the dollar and returning to gold would have erased the illusion and temporarily shut down the jobs.

So, dollar hyper inflation never arrived and gold did not make it's run because world CBs bet your productive efforts on supporting the dollar reserve. In the process, the US standard of living was raised tremendously on the backs of most of the worlds working poor. But this is not about to last!

A broad view from the ridge

Not long after the US defaulted on it's gold loans,,,, dollars held as gold certificates,,,,,, major thinkers began the long process of forming another world currency. One that would not maintain the fiction of a gold standard with the somewhat fixed gold prices inherent in such a system. The creation was distorted, to say the least. Just as the River in my first post was often seen in distortion, so too was this currency issue. It began with the European Currency Unit (ECU) and has later progressed to it's present state of the Euro.

After operating on a fiat system for 20+ years people are starting to realize that the only thing that backs a currency is the real productive efforts of their people. Yes, over time we always borrow more than out productive efforts can pay back and proceed to crash the money system.
But what else is new? (smile)

We call this a money's "timeline" and it's as new an idea a life, death and taxes! Time and debt age any money system until it dies. The world moves on. Only this time gold is going to play a different part in the drama. We will all watch it unfold.

It seems people saw something else that would make the Euro unique. Paid up assets also stand behind circulating money. Indeed, if someone owes a $100,000 dollar piece of land , has a good producing job and borrowed $50,000 against his land,,,,,, the world is likely to circulate that debt note as a fiat land backed currency. But, if his gold (the land) is worth $1 million in a free physical market,,, AND RISES FURTHER IF CURRENCY SUPPLY OUTPACES REAL PRODUCTION,,,,,,, and his other debts are relatively low ,,,,,, the same note would circulate just as effectively if the $50,000 was borrowed against his name alone.

In essence, the jump into the Euro is more based on a new currency that is more honest in dealing with our historic human dynamics. Let's try not lying to ourselves and admitting that gold alone in a currency will not remove our will to borrow and lend and therefore eventually defraud each other! Would it not be better to at least not shackle the money to gold. Indeed, a real physical freegold market will constantly be devaluating any fiat currency over a long term. While removing the need for CBs to maintain fixed exchange structure through a dirty float against gold.

But, the most important aspect is in the escape valve gold would provide to developing countries with positive trade flows. Those that wish to settle their debts outside the currency arena using gold as a settlement. Or, if they wish, to buy gold in the open market with their trade reserves.

The secret to all of this is in the "Legal Tender laws". Allowing gold to be used as a Legal Tender,,,, "for the settlement of all debts public and private",, but changing international law such that no form of debt can force it's payment in gold! This opens a one way street for gold and a two way street in fiat currencies. No one will lend gold because they cannot force it's return in the courts, thereby making gold a physical only international currency. Yet, on the other hand, we all must borrow in this modern world and currencies will be the only avenue for this. Creating a demand (and added value) for them in addition to general use demand.

The first thought many will have is that everyone will just buy gold to make debt payments, driving out fiat currencies. But remember, if you have debts they will be in currency settlement only. One will weigh the cheapest form for repayment! Gold in this atmosphere will be completely free to trade, become extremely expensive and stay that way. Not to mention that it's sale as a commodity (outside it's money use) on the private level will be well taxed.

We rest now

True there is a lot more to this story. Some posters have been discussing it publicly for some time on the USAGOLD forum. If you want a wonderful background reading on what "Freegold" would mean,,, get your laptops out tonight and read the link above. There is also considerable agitation voiced against this view.

First read all of:
Aristotle (2/7/2000; 7:15:24MDT - Msg ID:24589) It begins! -----* Executive Summary --an Outline of Observations *-----
My position: The world is going to change it's currency system before long and this will greatly impact the wealth of dollar asset holders. Not to mention physical gold holders. As a note for further consideration and talks,,,,, we have talked before about the "Texas Railroad Commission" and how it once declared oil a public utility and later controlled it's production. In the future, international law must declare all large gold reserves to be "public utilities" in the countries they reside. Mines will be very profitable and good investments after they recover from the destruction of our existing paper gold market. Still, their total production will be controlled and somewhat taxed. Small private operations will more likely be heavily taxed.

We will pick up the pace later (smile). Eventually getting to oil and the markets today.
Fires out.

Thanks for hiking the trail with me. I'm sorry I am not replying / talking here very much right now. My intent is to discuss mostly here as soon as we started. However, have had to wrap up several projects. With those behind me, I'll be writing quite a bit on both venues in a day or so. I already see something that needs further clarification and will correct soon. Also, I see a lot of openings for Trail Guide to jump in here and debate the issues!

First walk
The real hike begins

In my last post "Foundation", we raised several questions as we walked. Some were implied and others were direct. But all were mentioned to give pause to think. Today I'll offer my thoughts from an old study.

By 1971 the remnants of our gold exchange system had two major forces working against it.

First:
The US had printed way more dollars than it had gold to redeem them. This didn't even take into account the fact that Americans couldn't exchange the native part of the money supply for gold. The whole concept of physical bullion keeping officials from printing too much money became shot full of holes. The reality of our modern day dictated that any major world power, not just the USA could eventually override the precedent of a money supply tied to a fixed price of gold.

It seemed that as powers became super powers and nations represented larger people blocks, their ability to just walk away from a stated monetary policy increased. Thereby negating the good effects of gold on a system.

The US had changed it's gold backing policy once before as hard times attacked the local economy. After the 1929 downturn began to gut the wealth of almost everyone, we just took gold out of the INTERNAL money system and added that supply for backing the EXTERNAL money system (foreign dollars). Indeed, all American gold was called in from US citizens. So, for anyone that owned real gold (in their hands), the historic dynamics of retaining ones wealth in gold during a "debt destroying black hole experience" was removed. Further, the "gold force" was not allowed to do it's job of cleaning out all the "dead wealth" created through the prior process of inflating the money supply.

Of the many excellent writers on the USAGOLD forum. I think some would see that the "hard times" of economic contraction are created in the first place by not adhering to a golden monetary system. I agree. But looking at it today, whether it's before the fact or after the fact, society just will not work within a system that fully kills off bad debt. Even if one separates society into two groups,, "controllers" and "the rest of us", it's still the way the world has functioned from the beginning. So, the perception I have received as to how policy will evolve in the future presumes human dynamics will continue as they always have.

Also:
Having changed the rules once (1933) already. We (USA) later proceeded on the same road again. By 1971, we were making dollars at a rate that virtually assured another change in the gold backing game. Indeed, it was becoming obvious that gold could not control the will of a large nation.

Second:

In addition, the very system itself offered no discipline. Think about it. Accepted policy dictated that a nation's gold was held in the same geographic economic block that utilized the money said gold was to represent and control. If that block held the gold and the "real money substitutes" under the same society roof, there was no impartial authority to control how the rate of gold could be exchanged for dollars! A natural, fair $X dollars for X amount of gold exchange rate could be changed at will and for the economic will! For a true gold system to really work, gold would have to be stored and it's conversion rate controlled in a separate nation from the country that printed the money. Without that separation, a large modern power could "using local law, take it out of the system" or "not ship it's gold" if the money supply increased too much. Indeed, this first item was followed by the second and is exactly what happened after 1971.

So, our modern society was quickly proving that it was incapable of maintaining a monetary function of gold if it was intertwined in any official fiat currency mix. Even if the currency represented an outright gold receipt in storage and supposedly redeemable through force of international law!

The trail is heading uphill now

Few people can fully accept or consider that oil became the backing for world dollars after gold was removed in 71. But that is exactly what happened in theory and practice. Using some earlier writing, I'll tie them into what we are saying today. I'm going to repost some of my comments
(between ---- marks) from the USAGOLD forum archives. Starting with FOA (1/15/00; 14:58:12MDT - Msg ID:22961).
---- my friend, they were not using this concept as a real "commodity money play" in the "gold standard perception". At that time we were buying local oil with "fiat dollars" (made so by the 1933 internal gold confiscation) and foreign oil with "gold dollars". But, as you pointed out, dollar production was so far past it's "gold backing" that it was obvious they (USA) were pegging dollar printing to oil prosperity, not gold reserves. Still, with London gold and oil mostly settled in dollars, the foreign dollar oil pricing fully well expected to cash in unneeded dollars for gold. As we can see, reality and present day events of that time were as "mismatched" as today! All of the dollars success was ultimately made possible because oil could (and was) priced so far below it's "economic worth" to the world. At that time, even our Middle East friends had no idea just how useful oil would (and had) become to maintaining the world economic base.--------
Having read that (and keeping it in mind), I return to the implied questions of my "Foundation" post below. "Why in the world did foreign governments, especially Europeans, eventually go along with supporting a now fiat dollar reserve system after 71?"

Well, the whole notion of using any paper money is in the confidence that we can eventually trade it for something,,,,, Beer, food, clothes, cars, etc.. Gold was always in the money mix to insure that we could get these items at a somewhat standard price. Still, most of society thinks along the immediate line that: "I don't care where the fiat money comes from or what it's backed by,,,, especially if I can get something well below today's value cost,,,, and it benefits me, now!"

This is where oil made the jump from being "just a commodity" to "the major world necessity that can and did back the dollar". Prior to the US going off gold in 71, our whole economic structure was expanding because we were gaining massive leverage through cheap oil. Back then, oil was literally changing our lifestyle for the better, and doing so because it's dollar price was so incredibly low relative to what science was doing with it. Modern science had made oil worth so much more than we paid for it, we could extrapolate our debt and money supply growth far into the future and still figure that productive increases would cover it. In effect, the US was targeting it's economy and money value to future oil flow value, not gold. Here is the same thought in my post:
------ the new found prosperity from cheap dollar oil was being used to justify mountains of dollar debt. As long as a barrel of oil could be used to produce more relative real wealth than the dollars used to buy it represented, dollar inflation worked in the only political measurement that counted. "An increase in the standard of living"!--------
The only problem was that if we continued this route, two things had to give: we would have to leave the gold standard because our money supply was exploding (relative to gold supply) and find a new source of oil because ours was running out. Again, here's more from my old post
-------At that time (prior to 71) we were buying local (internal) oil with "fiat dollars" (made so by the 1933 internal gold confiscation) and foreign oil with "gold dollars".-----
------ , dollar production was so far past it's "gold backing" that it was obvious they (USA) were pegging dollar printing to oil prosperity. Still, with London gold and oil mostly settled in dollars, the foreign dollar oil deals fully well expected to cash in unneeded dollars for gold.--------
In the eyes of our official thinkers then,,,, For the local US economy to mature we needed to get off the gold standard,,,,,,,, get the world to accept fiat dollars backed by oil,,,, and find more oil that could deliver triple dollar value for every dollar we paid! It was a tall order and one that would require a major adjustment. The transition through out the 70s was rough to say the least.
More from my post:
-----------they (usa) were already shipping so many dollars out and any more would further aggravate the "possible gold drain perception". This was everyone's problem then as the industrialized world wanted to still get gold if needed, but they also liked the "non inflationary" (relative to that time) expansion of the dollar base as it expressed the new oil economy and it's real goods produced wealth. The US wanted new oil reserves to be "Local" (the Americas), because it could be paid in "fiat 33" cash (internal dollars were not backed with gold after 1933) , not the more golden "foreign cash". Both our neighbours to the north and south ever asked for much gold. In this light they acted like the local oil companies that received post 1933 dollars for oil (as mentioned above). Yet, to get these new reserves for fiat 33, they had to prevent the very cheap Middle East oil from supplying it all if dollar (oil) prices were higher. --------
------- First and foremost, everyone was caught flatfooted as the dollar broke from gold. Like I said above, the industrial world loved the dollar expansion in the oil context presented. (They were) Caught between what appeared as a good system based on cheap oil and the loss of gold delivery ------
------ Even as we left gold behind (1971) and oil went up (1978), the system still worked (at higher prices) because oil was perhaps delivering $100.00 worth of value and being brought for $30.----------------
In a somewhat convoluted way, by leaving the gold bond, it forced all world oil prices higher. Advancing the search for new (still cheap by value return standards) oil and paying for it using dollars backed by not only oil payment settlement in dollars but the continued purchase of supply "well under world use value".

G-7 countries knew that initially they would have to sell some gold in a controlled burn that would allow gold to seek a higher level after the dollar / gold break. However, once oil producers understood that gold was going to be "managed" at reasonable levels, the continued pricing of oil in dollars and it's flow was assured for some time. Allowing the exchange of dollars for gold on the world markets,,,, as needed and wanted.

This also appealed to major countries outside the US because it addressed the "second" problem I listed in the beginning. That being the geographic location of a currency's real backing asset. With most of the world oil reserves located outside the US,,,,,, and the US slowly running out of it's domestic reserves,,,,,,, using oil as a backing dynamic somewhat controlled the "free will" of the US. If indeed, the US backed away from managing a cheap gold market or ran it's printing press too fast,,,,,, oil prices could be managed upward in a devaluation of the dollar. No, not the best of policy concepts for the world, but better than perceiving that the US "Fort Knox" gold was a control on money printing!

Going back to the initial logic of my "Foundation" post, this was the context that G-7 countries "brought into" as they accepted and supported the new fiat dollars without gold. Like I said, the alternative would be a real mess to behold and this position brought time. Time to conceive and introduce a new world reserve structure.

It worked in a broken pattern for a number of years. Oil and gold defied all predictions of higher prices as they retreated from every advance. Central banks gorged themselves with worthless dollar reserves and prevented a hyperinflation of the dollar in the process. They did this, because they knew that gold had the ability to completely replace any and all loss of dollar reserve value once a new system was in operation.

Cutting across the field and returning to today's trail

Nations today, with little gold holdings seemed to have no clue to where this was all going. To a degree, the US used them as they took in dollars and never brought gold at all. They must be thinking that the dollar can be expanded forever and never lose value! To this end, they have based their entire social and economic order on selling goods to the US for a dream in return. Yet, after all these years they are only now seeing that foreign dollars are worthless when the US only runs a trade deficit that will not reverse. The real risk today is now being understood. The American economy will only slow down from a hyperinflation,,,,, and that will be caused from a shift from the dollar reserve function! Trapped holding dollars and no gold to compensate, these other nations are headed for real trouble.

Again, thoughts from my Foundation post

Euroland thinkers (today) are beginning to see where they really don't need dollars in reserve to retain market share in the US. Just as I asked: "if the US is just pumping it's money supply to build a bubble,,,, flooding the world with inflated dollars that we must buy to engage exchange rates..... With the Euro in play,, why do I need to hold their dollars to legitimize the further creation of my own currency? I can buy gold as a "wealth asset" to hold as a physical reserve and print my own money supply....... It's the same difference and at least I have a reserve that

" " IS NOT FLOWING FROM AN IRREVERSIBLE TRADE DEFICIT " " !

In better words:

The Euro float is still too small to receive a massive dumping of unneeded dollars. Indeed, the more the US tries to discredit the Euro,,,, the greater the risk of a "Washington Agreement #2" where the BIS / ECB uses unneeded reserve dollars to BYPASS the paper markets and massively buy "real PHYSICAL gold". In fact, all they have to do is enter the market in a minor way and the entire paper gold arena will go up in flames.

So, Is the Euro falling? Or is the dollar running away as a liquidity crisis threatens it's use?
Are we at the very doorstep of a crash in the US markets and it's dollar?
All caused by an evolving transition from the dollar reserve system?
We have some old writings on this subject and will examine them later.

Questions for Trail Guide and Oro:
Under your particular system that you advocate:

Hello Julia,
You are right in that this could unfold several ways. Your question is unique in that it's in a real world perspective. This is somewhat how I see it working out:

---1. In what form will I be paid for my job? ----
If your American, in dollars. No matter what the value or inflation rate, the dollar will not die as the US currency. Just like in Mexico today, one would also carry a hard currency in his pocket (dollars there, today are hard). Depending on how this unfolds, you may carry Euros here later??

----2. Could my gold be used as collateral for a loan to purchase my house?
My view is,,,,I doubt it very seriously. The push, world-wide will be to keep gold from being entangled in the loan system. You could sell it and pay a large tax. But, that will only be for people that have to have currency (to satisfy a debt). Or, you could do like most, use the gold directly as a lawful legal tender. I know this sounds strange now, but in a later context it may not. I'll be talking about this later.

-----3. What are my investment options for my gold? Is there an avenue for me to loan my physical gold for interest or will it be strictly hold for growth return. ------

------ 4. Will I even be allowed to keep my gold and have the freedom to buy more?----------

For myself, I expect to be holding gold as a "real wealth" asset that will rise in currency terms. It will rise from any further fiat inflation and,,,,, it will rise from "it's" world currency demand. I expect to use bullion coins "lawfully" as a currency that cannot be lent or borrowed. However, the premium on old pre 33 coins will soar because they will be the only form of gold that can be lent and borrowed against. As hinted on the Trails page, the laws could be changed making it impossible to force any loan payment in bullion gold. Voluntary payment accepted by both parties is ok. But one may not,,,, in court,,,,, force gold payment to cover any debt. This would not stop gold use, but would stop all bullion gold lending as no one could be sure of the return of physical gold.

As always, I own gold as a percentage of my total wealth,,,, not all my wealth. I suppose the more one understands, the higher the percentage may be.

Julia, I'm going way out ahead of myself here. This is what I see for now! (smile)

------Foa/Another, I am following the price of oil. But, if I understand the two of you correctly, we haven't accounted for the price of what oil should be from the inflation registered since the lateeighties in dollar terms. So I would have to see still higher oil prices and at some point a coinciding rise in gold or a higher price that trails oils dollar rise per barrel.----------

Hello Al,
You are right, oil has along way to go before it returns to an overpriced range. By my numbers it should be around $45 and that is the lowest. Even there it represents a positive economic function for the economy because of what we can do with it.

It can rise to this level because we no longer have the whole world supporting the dollar. The pressure to make the dollar look and feel good at all costs is waning. Not even $50 in paper gold will be an incentive to gun production. The dollar backers may try it, but with oil eventually rising, no one will come to their paper gold party.

Like I said before, the political software is in place, the mechanics of this process are moving and we are "on the road" to high priced physical gold. Actually, in dollar terms, high priced everything!

In fits and starts, oil will ratchet higher. Just like the river we looked at "on the trail", the whole thing is moving in one direction. We may hit some rough water, but we are going to the sea come what may!

Hello Henri,
Yes, the BIS is indeed moving the gold now! Probably completely outside the LBMA. We don't know exactly where it's going yet as it's not showing up in the EMCBs,,,,,,,, yet!

We have talked before about the ECB/BIS sooner or later buying gold. I'll be writing about this later on the Trails page. Prior to the Euro they (BIS) had marked $280 as the bottom. I think they were shocked that the dolar/IMF bunch were stupid enough to sanction it's trading below that
figure. I was too as I made a major effort to buy more physical in the spring of 99,,, around 285 or so. Then the BBs just dumped paper on the markets as if no one would care! Well, it stayed down there for what 3 months? Then here comes the Washington announcement. Still, that agreement only isolates the continent from being caught in a paper storm. If this currency war gets out of hand, our boys could drive the London price as low as they want it to go! The paper won't be worth much in real gold, but every trader, market maker and mine owner/ investor is contractually locked to that price making medium. It could all go down in a huge ball of fire and only the physical holders will be whole. (notice I said holders not just owners (smile))

thanks TG

------- Could you please explain " the dollar running away as a liquidity crisis threatens its use"?---

Hello Cavan Man,
I can't find the series of post where we discussed this! Buried somewhere in the archives are several references from me, ORO and others addressing this.

The short and sweet of it:
This is one of the things old Martin Armstrong, Another and others referred to a long time ago when asked when the dollar would fall and gold rise. It seems that in the later stages of an extremely expanded economy, any contraction of financial assets forces the currency to rise, not fall. We can look to Japan as somewhat of an example. After all of their hyper inflated assets began rolling over years ago, they had (and are having) a difficult time keeping the currency down. The officials have to constantly pump the money reserves and supply in order to drive it down.

The dollar should behave no different when the time comes. This is where many investors read the signs wrong and assume the currency is strong from a dynamic economy. Most people understand price inflation, and how excess money creation is the process that makes it. But few can grasp how hyperinflation is started as a different dynamic. It is a "driven recourse" where the Central bank is fighting a super financial contraction before the fact. Usually it's created by some unexpected event, either natural or man made.

I think the Euro is consuming some of the financial roll the dollar once had. In the process dollar assets are disappearing while people fund the shortfall in the short term arena. This can be the only explanation for the constant daily reserve adds by the fed (that TownCrier is reporting). We may truly be entering a crisis phase now? We shall see.

Again, I stress that in this situation paper gold can work for or against you! People keep working gold as a trading play using "house rules" that favour the casino. In this ongoing drama using any leverage at all is going to carry some tough odds to beat!

Also: ---Has your view on confiscation (USA) changed--------

No. But there is a risk of them changing the legal tender laws...... and that could make owning the old coins or newer non LT coins more attractive. This was a new item for me. I never saw it in this context. Ever notice how all the new bullion coins are marked as legal tender? I'll get around to this in time.

Dear FOA: If the long-expected market crash occurs soon, how long do you think it will take for hyper-inflation to set in? Should we be stocking up on things now and preparing for panic in the stores, or will the inflation happen gradually? Thanks!

Leigh,
I have lived in the South Pacific right in Typhoon country. Part of regular life was to be stocked up on everything, all the time. Even generators. It's the same in the waters where CMax sails his boat, stocking up is normal (if one has reserve cash to do so). Indeed, for many people of the world Y2Ks and major inflation's are,,,,,, well,,,,, just the way it works.

It isn't so important to know when as it is to know "it will". Besides, stocking up on things one always uses actually is an easier way of life,, perhaps even a luxury (smile).

justifiable use of federal power at a time of national emergency
Interesting stuff!! no?

Legal Tender Cases

(1870, 1871), two cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the power of Congress to authorize government notes not backed by specie as money that creditors had to accept in payment of debts.

To finance the Civil War, the federal government in 1862 passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the creation of paper money not redeemable in gold or silver. About $430 million worth of "greenbacks" were put in circulation, and this money by law had to be accepted for all taxes, debts, and other obligations--even those contracted prior to the passage of the act.

In Hepburn v. Griswold (Feb. 7, 1870), the Court ruled by a four-to-three majority that Congress lacked the power to make the notes legal tender. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, who as secretary of the Treasury during the Civil War had been involved in enacting the Legal Tender Act, wrote the majority opinion, declaring that the congressional authorization of greenbacks as legal tender violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against deprivation of property without due process of law.

On the day the decision was announced, a disapproving President Grant sent the nominations of two new justices to the Senate for confirmation. Justices Bradley and Strong were confirmed, and at the next session the court agreed to reconsider the greenback issue. In Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis (May 1, 1871), the Court reversed its Hepburn v. Griswold decision by a five-to-four majority, asserting that the Legal Tender Act of 1862 represented a justifiable use of federal power at a time of national emergency.

government's power to enact legal-tender legislation and defending such power under the "necessary and proper" clause of the Constitution



Strong, William

U.S. Supreme Court justice (1870-80), one of the most respected justices of the 19th-century
court.

Admitted to the bar in 1832, Strong practiced law in Reading, Pa., and served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1847-51). While sitting on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (1857-68), Strong, a Democrat but a firm supporter of the Union, changed his political affiliation
and became a Republican.

-------- in Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis (1871), the newly formed court overturned the Hepburn decision by a vote of 5-4. Strong spoke for the majority, upholding the
government's power to enact legal-tender legislation and defending such power under the "necessary and proper" clause of the Constitution. The abrupt reversal of a major decision so soon after the enlargement of the bench renewed the charges against Grant. Despite this controversy, which overshadowed Strong's appointment to the high court and his first major decision, he served with distinction for 10 years, winning the respect of the legal community for
his ability and integrity.-------------------

And how many "shinplasters" are in your bank account?
Here is some more very good food for thought. Please note the word use and how it could be so very "in context today". Especially these items:

--suspensions had occurred during periods of war or economic crisis-------------

----- "Hard money" advocates wanted to resume paying specie for this paper money, while "soft money" supporters feared the deflationary impact resumption would produce. -------

-----public favourably inclined to keep using the much more convenient paper money--------

============================================================

the redemption of U.S. paper money by banks or the Treasury in metallic (usually gold) coin.

Except for a few periods of suspension (1814-15, 1836-42, and 1857), Americans were able to redeem paper money for specie from the time of the ratification of the Constitution (1789) to the onset of the Civil War (1861). The suspensions had occurred during periods of war or economic crisis. With the outbreak of hostilities between the North and the South, the federal government again suspended specie payments late in 1861.

In 1862 the government began issuing paper money, called "greenbacks" and "shinplasters," and in 1863 it authorized federally chartered banks to issue national bank notes. By the end of the war in 1865, more than $430,000,000 worth of paper money (declared legal tender by Congress) was in circulation.

"Hard money" advocates wanted to resume paying specie for this paper money, while "soft money" supporters feared the deflationary impact resumption would produce. After the Supreme Court sanctioned the legitimacy of the paper money in the Legal Tender Cases (1870-71), congressional backers of a return to specie payments passed the Resumption Act of 1875.

In accord with the Resumption Act, specie payments were resumed on Jan. 1, 1879. But the knowledge that the government could indeed redeem each greenback or bank note at par in gold made the public favourably inclined to keep using the much more convenient paper money.

greenbacks continued as the accepted currency!
You may have to put these posts in order, but it's worth a thought.
I know most all of you already know this stuff,,,,, but thought a short review would be good.
(smile)




Resumption Act of 1875

in U.S. history, culmination of the struggle between "soft money" forces, who advocated continued use of Civil War greenbacks, and their "hard money" opponents, who wished to
redeem the paper money and resume a specie currency.

By the end of the Civil War, more than $430 million in greenbacks were in circulation, made legal tender by congressional mandate. After the Supreme Court sanctioned the constitutionality of the greenbacks as legal tender, hard money advocates in Congress pushed for early resumption of specie payments and retirement of the paper money.

On Jan. 14, 1875, Congress passed the Resumption Act, which called for the secretary of the Treasury to redeem legal-tender notes in specie beginning Jan. 1, 1879. The bill also called for reducing the greenbacks in circulation to $300 million and for replacing the fractional paper
currency ("shinplasters") with silver coins as rapidly as possible.

Members of the new Greenback Party were bitterly opposed to the Resumption Act, and in 1878 they succeeded in raising the amount of paper money allowed in circulation. Specie
resumption proceeded on schedule, however, and Treasury Secretary John Sherman accumulated enough gold to meet the expected demand. When the public realized that the paper money was "good as gold," there was no rush to redeem, and greenbacks continued as the accepted currency.

Isn't it interesting (and supporting our freegold cause) that the government can "legitimize" an "unbacked" "greenback" currency ,,,,,,, by just accepting debt satisfaction (payment) in said paper!

It seems that during both yesterday and today, the publics perception of money in circulation is more identified by it's ability to "square the books". Whether it's gold or fiat!?!?


=================================================
Greenback movement

(c. 1868-88), in U.S. history, the campaign, largely by persons with agrarian interests, to maintain or increase the amount of paper money in circulation. Between 1862 and 1865, the U.S. government issued more than $450,000,000 in paper money not backed by gold (greenbacks) to help finance the Union cause in the American Civil War. After the war, fiscal
conservatives demanded that the government retire the greenbacks, but farmers and others who wished to maintain high prices opposed that move. In 1868 the Democrats gave partial support to the Greenback movement by endorsing a plan that called for the redemption of certain war bonds by the issuance of new greenbacks.

Legal Tender,,,,,,, a long subject
After reading below, one can see that silver came into the picture more so because it would allow "greenback" expansion. The whole context of involving silver into the money system came about from the changing of the "Legal Tender" laws earlier. The thrust of the argument was that
people wanted the ability to expand their fiat monetary base........ and the Legal Tender laws were the first way such a change came about.

be back later TG

============================================================

More on the "Greenback movement"


The Panic of 1873 and the subsequent depression polarized the nation on the issue of money, with farmers and others demanding the issuance of additional greenbacks or the unlimited coinage of silver. In 1874 champions of an expanded currency formed the Greenback-Labor Party, which drew most of its support from the Midwest; and after Congress, in 1875, passed the Resumption Act, which provided that greenbacks could be redeemed in gold beginning Jan.
1, 1879, the new party made repeal of that act its first objective. The 45th Congress (1877-79), which was almost evenly divided between friends and opponents of an expanded currency, agreed in 1878 to a compromise that included retention of the Resumption Act, the expansion of paper money redeemable in gold, and enactment of the Bland-Allison Act, which provided for a limited resumption of the coinage of silver dollars. In the midterm elections of 1878, the
Greenback-Labor Party elected 14 members of Congress and in 1880 its candidate for president polled more than 300,000 votes, but after 1878 most champions of an expanded currency judged that their best chance of success was the movement for the unlimited coinage of silver.

A Clear Path
It's a nice day to get outside! Let's walk a while.

Think back at our recent history of gold and one can build a better perspective of this "new gold market".

Onward:

After the 1971 gold window was closed, the gold market didn't immediately feel the effects of major physical buying. At least until 1976. Most of the world remained shocked that the dollar was no longer backed, but perception remained that eventually gold would be brought back into the official money system. Yes, the dollar did drop in value but not so much that it would destroy the reserve system.

The world remained tied to using dollar reserves even though gold no longer backed them. Oil prices began their long march upward, but most of these early advances were more so political statements, rather than related to the dollar problem. Oil states, flush with cash, were able to convert dollars into bullion at still reasonable prices (as could everyone else). In addition, rising oil revenues were running well ahead of bullion prices and goods inflation. Producers saw little reason to overly rush into gold because some thinkers still held the prospect of a later dollar / gold relink. Especially so as gold began to sink in price after the US made it legal to own again (for US citizens).

By early 1976, gold was heading for $100 an ounce and making dollar holders less nervous. At that price gold was only a little more than double it's last official price of $42 per oz.. It seemed that the US had achieved what was largely unspoken at the time:
---------- By taking the dollar off the gold exchange system, it provoked a large increase in the dollar price of oil. As I just pointed out, most of those early price rises were political. But not all of it. There was some marking of oil to the free price of gold in a attempt to replicate any lost bullion value. Still, initially, oil prices more than made up for their (producers) now accepting fiat "greenbacks".
Oil was then and is now the life blood of our "new oil economy". For the US, this rising price set in motion a massive effort to find new untapped reserves that were unusable with the low prices an earlier gold dollar generated. Prior, without a rising oil price, the US faced the real prospect of running out of local oil and having to accept the reality of eventually importing Middle East crude for close to 100% of it's needs. What many only speculated about in the late 60s, later became reality as the Middle Eastern reserves did indeed prove large enough to supply and cheap enough to pump for everyone's needs. Their reserves would outlast and underprice our reserves, as long as we paid them in gold dollars. -----------------------
I pointed out in my "First Walk" post how oil was indeed taking over the job as an asset backing the dollar. Even with the first increases in dollar oil prices, the world and the producers were very willing to accept a dollar value based on an expanding "new oil economy". At least until mid 1976!

Look over here:

Of course, during this time there was plenty of "background noise" on the world stage. There always is and it usually distorts the picture just enough to keep us from seeing what was really happening. Like looking at a river up close, in the rapids, instead of far away. But, in 1976 :
------The IMF convened a monetary summit in Jamaica and ratified "The Jamaica Accords" in April. For some major people, this paper was the reality that drove home the golden point. The Accords formally recognized the managed floating currency system for the duration. Marking a turning point in how national super powers effect fiat currency use in our new modern economy. But more importantly, gold was "demonetized" as a reserve asset! -------------
Most everyone immediately grasped what this meant; "that gold would no longer back the currencies as it did in the old gold exchange system". However, for some 15 years to come, no one fully understood what was really said! In the Accords, the wording stated that gold would remain a " " Reserve Asset" "! Indeed, as a non currency, real wealth "reserve asset", this world class money was set free to become a backing for any economy. Even one based on a new reserve system. This my friends, was the key to perceiving what would later happen in the world gold markets. We'll get back to it later.

It's no secret why gold went wild from it's lows that year. For the first time since the 71 break, really big demand was driving the market. No it wasn't just the public's buying of coins and small bars. Nor was it the futures traders with their paper orders that caused gold to rise so much. It was the wholesale scramble by huge dollar holders trying to buy some of those "reserve assets" before it's price went sky high. This buying was in the form of 400 oz bars,,,,,,, lot's of them at a time! Some Central Banks slowly sold into the storm in a effort to manage the demand. Politics and the media did a good job of telling the story as they saw it. But the real reason for the managed rise was to demonstrate to oil producers and other dollar holders that everyone couldn't convert if they brought physical all at once. Had some banks not sold, gold would have gone into the thousands, and in the process destroyed the dollar long before it's date was due. Without a reserve system to replace it, our world economy would have crashed and burned.

Further along the path:

Without the prospects of gold ever backing the fiat money system again, a good portion of the next oil price hikes (late 70s) were dollar related. It wasn't until the mid 80s that two things occurred to lower oil prices for an extended period of time.

First-----

The incredible rise in oil prices once again took away some of the pressing need for producers to buy gold. Oil itself was compensating for price inflation. Not to mention that gold was seen as still relatively high. Further, the gold marketplace itself was evolving into more of a contract market than a physical one. Offering hope that financial demand could be channelled away from becoming physical demand.

Europe, London and the US had all joined together in a quiet effort to better manage the price of gold. All in an effort to once again buy time for the dollar. From a US perspective, this time was needed to "work out" the dollars problems. From a Europe / BIS perspective, it was time used to build a dollar replacement.

Did both of these power blocks know what the other was doing? I think they fully well did. But as is usually the case in warfare, the generals on each side think the other doesn't have a chance. Truly, the net effect of this joint effort resulted in a stalled gold market, even though the reasons for it differed.


Second------

Once the evolution of this supposedly free gold market was seen by oil as backing the value of the dollar (with a stalled gold price), production was increased in the mid 80s. The combination of OPEC's added supply and the new supply created by the price induced US drilling, all forced oil prices down. The whole process was seen in the media as the world's dealing with OPEC and forcing the dollar down their throats in the process. But no one ever made the connection that they didn't have to take dollars for settlement and the world would still buy oil. But support the dollar for a purpose they continued to do!

Oil still had it's political ups and downs over the years and the same reflected in it's prices. But supply was mostly assured from a level to falling gold price. During the next ten years form 85 through 95, few really noticed that although gold and oil charted in the same direction, they never flowed in the same direction. Nor did they grasp how the gold market was engineered to supply gold for this very reason.

With most of the dollar oil problem licked, the G-7 began an effort to keep the dollar in play. Even though it's debt had aged it and it's timeline was running out. In 1985 they started a series of currency moves that would last until the early 90s. From the "Plaza Accords" (85) to the "Louvre Accords" (87), it was all an effort to stall and stretch out any crisis of the dollar. It seemed that no matter how much the dollar was inflated or how much debt was built upon it, it would be supported for all the world to see. Not even the gold market would be allowed to reflect any portion of this ongoing currency crisis. Showing their full colours in managing this "new gold market", the $500 price in late 87 was quickly brought down. Indeed, the evolution from a bullion marketplace into a mostly "new paper marketplace" was well underway. The later fall in price after reaching a Gulf War peak, was even more stunning.


It was right about here, in the early 90s that some major players began to stop trading gold. Instead they started slowly buying physical. It seems they finally understood what the "Jamaica Accords" of so long ago really meant. Indeed, it was worth leaving all the "winnings to come" on the table! Because, no matter how high dollar assets would go, physical gold was destine to go much, much higher.

In December of 1991, twelve members of the original "European Economic Community", now called the EU (European Union) signed the "Maastricht Treaty". It spelled out the process where they would establish a full currency union, called the EMU (European Monetary Union).

Once the EMU process was signed into law, we could see that there was indeed a purpose behind the formation of the "European Economic Community" in the early 70s. Because it closely followed the 1972 "Smithsonian Agreements", signed in Washington, declaring the dollar / gold break an official act by the US. Nor was it a coincidence that the very first discussion of a Pan Euro currency block in the form of a "European Economic Unit" was first heard of in 1976. The date of the "Jamaica Accords". The EEU, a precursor to the Euro, soon became official in the early 80s.

On January 1 1999, the Euro was born. On the headlines of almost every paper, the new Euro currency immediately became the topic of speculation. How high or low would it go,,,,,,, will it last,,,,,, what good is it,,,, and on and on. Yet, completely hidden from view and outside most speculator interest, one important item was overlooked. Once this competing reserve currency was formed, the two major power blocks of the world no longer shared the purpose of maintaining a paper gold market! Established, maintained and supported for the purpose of absorbing the demand for gold, it's price damping effects were no longer needed.

What an overview:

From a Euroland viewpoint, the dollar no longer needed to be supported by a low gold price. With the Euro in place and holding a large portion of the worlds new, non currency "reserve asset" for support, they no longer had a reason to buy at $280 or sell at $480. Indeed, they told the world they were backing out of the paper gold game with the Washington Agreement. We fully expect that during the 5 year time frame of that agreement, physical gold will soar from lack of supply as they trade it outside the London dominated paper markets. We also expect a convoluted workout of the left over contract markets as they fluctuate between $0 and $infinity. Further, the greenback could now go as high or as low as world traders would like to take this now "on it's own" currency.

From an oil producer viewpoint, with the physical gold market now only a shadow of the total "paper gold market", they can now only float a few dollars in sufficient amounts back into physical gold. With half the gold market supporting players retreating into the Euro umbrella, the present market will revert to little more than a paper float. With this in mind, it should be no surprise to anyone that crude prices began rising almost immediately after the EMU. Eventually, even $30 oil will disrupt world dollar debt to a point where the dollar exchange rate collapses. Forcing a run from dollar settlement and into Euro or a Euro + gold pricing basket for crude.

Prior to this they watch the same drama today you and I see. An ongoing dollar liquidity crisis that had long ago reached the end of it's timeline. Now it grows worse, brought about by not only the loss of most of it's Euroland financing function,,, but also it's Pan European support. Truly, this crisis demand will drive the dollar ever higher. A hyperinflationary trigger, not completely unlike the one facing Japan today. Day after day one has but to watch the US Fed ever pumping reserves in a effort to reflate a world dollar tire that's full of Euro holes!

From a gold bullion viewpoint: the Jamaica Accords signalled a permanent shift from holding gold and fiat currencies in competition with each other. Yet, the eventual good effects of such a shift would only happen once the sick dollar system was killed by it's debt load. Untill 1999, one of the two world's power blocks had a purpose in keeping it alive. Until a fall back replacement could be formed, a dead dollar would leave gold alone in the currency roll and sent the world into a depression. Truly, with talk of the EMU falling apartin 1997, oil wasn't the only entity that would have bid on gold if the Euro had failed.

But it didn't. Soon, bullion will return to doing what it did centuries ago. Representing the value of the worlds assets and productive wealth. Only, with the world having far more in the way of modern things than ever before in it's history, "Freegold" trading as a "reserve asset" will be valued as never before.

You ask, what are the dynamics of such a position?

How are world investors prepared for this event?

I'll tell you my view,,,,,,, next time on the trail!

----Those of you who read this report regularly know that we don't buy the government statistics on inflation. -------

Michael,
Isn't that so very true! I completely agree. But in a more broad sense, doesn't that just delineate this era into something completely different from other recent (relatively mild) US inflations?

Here we are with a currency that's been in it's most recent extended inflation for 15+ years and almost no statistics show "major" price rises yet. Considering the overall world-wide expansion of dollar assets during this period, we would think 15% price increases would have already been the norm for several years. Along with seeing 15% interest rates. Clearly this is not the case as
somewhere, someone has been buying up our expanded dollar assets and holding them in support of the dollar system. This portion simply cannot be held as an investment, because one must eventually buy something here to gain from it.

I really love how everyone likes to say that all the foreign money is coming here to invest in this system,,,,, and that is why our markets and dollars were so strong most of this decade. Truly, if this was the case, our gross investment outflows minus the foreign investment inflows would have to have covered the huge trade deficit for the past 20 years! It never happened! Take out the expanded dollar reserve holdings of foreign CBs and their matching local currency creations from this and it would show a different picture. A colossal trade flow of dollar assets back into the US for conversion. Truly CB support was the dynamic that saved us from a crippling price inflation.

So, we have enjoyed a position of issuing a reserve currency and having mostly foreign governments support our asset values and lifestyles by absorbing all. This dollars support ,,,,,,, if they stop it's all over, yes? All the past dollar inflation will show up here in the only way that can balance ,,,, in the form of a major hyper price inflation. But not to worry, they have helped us for some time and will continue because the dollar is still the only reserve currency to support,,,, right?

But suddenly our USA official policy has changed from the recent past responses to up-ticks in price inflation. Our officials are doing their best to set the stage of not reporting any price effects at all. Covering the recent past, present and future reports by changing the rules. What gives? Why not do as in the past,,,,,, report rising prices,,,,, and raise rates to control it? We have the tools and support to do this, or do we?

In the past, "real figures" were reported because we "could" do something about them. Raise rates and tighten money! But we always thought (or were told) that these "tools" could be used by themselves. In reality, they never could. The dollar was "the" reserve currency and had to have the full support of other nations in order for this host country to reign in money growth and control prices. Doing so alone would leave us open to the risk of a complete economic crash in our economy. Of course the worlds system would also die because no other currency reserve existed then. So, the risk of "no support" was never there. Today, it is. I think my friends call this a strategic political risk unique for this era.

Yes, we could raise rates in a magnitude needed to control the situation, if the real price inflation figures were reported. But, if at the same time foreign nations decided not to support us and begin slowly converting dollar assets into another denomination??? We would have the very visual effect of a falling dollar with rate rises also appearing as an attempt to stop the currency from failing. Instead of just raising rates for the simple reason of slowing the economy. On top of this, if our present paper system that controls the gold market pricing action was to suddenly fracture,,,,,, the outflow of money into real gold would really make dollar inflation look ??????? Interesting situation, no?

I think today, the Euro has changed things and we are now entering a "final US inflation" because of it! It's not just the last few years we are talking about, rather the complete era. Our past ability to control rising prices without creating a major economic contraction is gone.
Gone,,,, not because the Euro is so great a competition for us,,,,,,, rather gone because "that" block of support has it's own major currency system to support. As a result, our US money printing through reserve expansion is now on a permanent one-way road. It will continue until it converts everyone into a hard money saver and paper sellers. Rate rises will be small and always be well behind the fact. One way or another, our currency value is going to adjust and it will impact every paper asset denominated in dollars.

No, our governments hiding of facts is indeed something more different than in the past. Currency war strategy has a way of doing this. We can expect more in the future. We know that more such under reporting is coming, because these are current signs of a monetary system living it's last days. Once the tools to correct a "regular inflation" were impaired, the final inflation process begins without end. If one is correctly prepared, it's going to be a real show to watch!

Hello Solomon,
You write:

Solomon Weaver (2/23/2000; 22:12:25MDT - Msg ID:25912)
Is it Kuhn who gave us paradigms?

-----Something on the back of my brain tells me that the phrase "paradigm shift" was coined by Thomas Kuhn in a book called "the Structure of Scientific Revolution". It keeps reoccurring to me that FOA is telling us about a "new" gold market, which will behave much differently than the "old".
And many of us analyse the current market using today's perspective...----------

-----------------------------------------
TG:
Yes, I think this is a major problem and one that will backfire on many investors. Let's face it, no matter where the average investor resides in this world most all of them operate with a perception that the dollar will remain the worlds "supported" reserve currency. Few of them fully appreciate the impact a deviation from that norm would create.

They buy into gold derivatives with a dogged determination that the dollar price of these securities will always reflect the physical trading price on an equal or greater basis. It won't. It can't!

We can trace almost all of this perception from the views of the "gold trader". A perception that the entire "Western gold market" is built upon. He's primarily a paper trader of gold stocks, gold stock options, gold futures, etc.. Their whole strategy rests on the argument that the "price of physical traded gold" will wait for them to convert their paper profits into gold if the run really gets started.
The very leverage they play for is the same leverage that will gun the physical price faster than they can ever move.

As I just noted to MK, the publics real price inflation grasp is going to be from real events. Not from the past official policy of telling us how it really is. In this atmosphere the sponsors of our paper gold market are going to have a free hand to sell (create) contract gold without end. The more the Fed guns the reserves, the more the cash liquidity will be available to sell gold. Because so few of the paper traders wish to exercise these contracts, price discovery is totally in the hands of the market sponsors.

Because of this, at first dollar hyper inflation will not be reflected in a rising price of gold on the current dollar paper gold market. It will be reflected in a corresponding lack of real gold relative to outstanding contracts! A physical gold shortage will happen "first", as the contract price system slowly defaults in an ever lower price. Next the paper markets will totally fail from non availability. That means a super low (discounted) bid price for contract gold. That's the same price the stock market players currently value your gold shares with.

Once the dollar gold contract system fails (and this will be happening during a full blown "hidden" price inflation), a physical gold market will develop,,,, weather officially (Euroland) or black market style.

The point is that during this dollar inflation, physical gold will be in almost no supply and it's price will be 10X the paper price. No body, and I mean NO BODY is going to be cashing out of gold shares or any form of paper gold and doing an even swap! Every gold mine that operates using the
dollar gold market to sell into,,,, does it's financing with and is hedged leveraged with dollar based Bullion Banks ,,,,,, is going to see their stock ride the paper gold market to it's end.

A few of them will be allowed to tie themselves into ECB/BIS physical sales, very few! Many will try, but only if they can escape their financing ties with banks, that themselves are locked into the current paper bullion market. It's that simple.

I've mention this dynamic before. It's the main reason why I own only a very small slect few gold shares. If they fall,,,,, it will not impact me at all. Of my hard money "metal" investment portion of wealth,,,, 99% of it is in "non-USA Legal Tender Bullion". But not completely for the reasons our site provider does it (a good portion is in K-rands and bars, the rest in early and rare bullion). I'll
discuss this a later time.

We are always watching for the political dynamics to change, but I think only two things could make this happen.

First,,,, The US Fed would have to suddenly decide to break the current inflation on it's own and shut down all liquidity operations. Strangely enough, this would have the absolutely opposite effect many think. In today's changing times, such a deflationary move would completely fracture the contract creating ability of the Bullion Banks. The paper gold market would soar first, then lock from failure. Obviously, mines and their shares would do very well in such a situation. "If" investors could understand the positive effects such a dollar deflation would have on gold.

Second,,,,, our current process will change if Euroland decides to bid and trade openly with physical gold outside the LBMA marketplace,,,, and do so at ever higher dollar prices as they dispose of their mountain of dollar reserves. This is a very real possibility during this developing
currency war.

Otherwise, they have decided to let the "Western gold traders" live in their "paper market" and die in their own stew as the contract prices fall to ??. All the while letting the paper market have it's way with us,,,,, as they withdraw from supporting the dollar while the Fed tries pump liquidity as a real price inflation breaks out.

Solomon,
It's some interesting drama unfolding, no? Your advise in this next post is "right on"!

Solomon Weaver (2/23/2000; 21:22:54MDT - Msg ID:25906)

-----So, given that this is not the current structure of the gold market, and that it is only likely to change when there is a massive problem in the status quo, it is actually very safe to say that the real bull cannot come until the paper market of today collapses. Until then, it is really only that bear in disguise that I mentioned a little earlier ------

------I think what Trail Guide is trying to tell us is that now is the time to get some gold for yourself, because when the destructive bear/bull enters to make way for the real bull, it will be much too late to get real gold at prices of today.------------

---------Why not?-------

Michael,
This whole inflation picture fits so perfectly together now, that none of us want to believe or fully accept it. Even I reserve a small corner of my brain for doubt. Honestly, none of this thinking came my way on it's own conception. It was drilled into me by others over many years. Long before most of what the last few years made apparent.

Today, I have the luxury of accepting this broad hyper-inflation view with confidence. After watching it progress for so many years and using this different perspective, all the current contradictions make sense to me. It does all fit so well:

Allowing the stock market to run away with no hint of trying to stop it.

Letting the money supply and bank reserves grow uncontrolled.

Forcing down interest rates after the LTCM problem.

Watching the trade deficit explode with no thought of intervening to lower the dollar exchange rate.

Changing the rules for calculating the PPI and CPI.

Buying in 30yr. treasury bonds so the markets would not expose the cost of a runaway money supply.

Promoting to the world that we are paying off the national debt when we clearly are not.

Even going against their own system and accepting a new definition of gold in the IMF. Just so they can keep some foreign dollar assets alive a little longer.

Paper gold traders talking about slicing out their piece of the pie using the same leverage that got us here in the first place.

Oil prices that can only indicate a withdrawal of support. Indeed, the very kingpin of support that has made the dollar last so long.

On and on and on!

These are all the things of a dyeing money system. One running on it's last breath as those that control it can only maneuver to prolong it. Not save it!

Yes, the trail up close is so very clear while the fog of human emotions clouds the far view.

Golden Truth

Hello,
I see that you need concrete advice.

First, you can only own your wealth in a way that your heart and understanding tells you. Perhaps you placed far more of your assets in metal than you could hold "through thick and thin"? I have been buying bullion for a long, long time, but it's not so much of my wealth that I have to sell it. I admit, it is probably much more than most anything read here. But then, I don't know who is here, do I? How about you? Do you have to sell because you own "too much"??
Owning physical gold as I and others do is like having a bank account. I don't check my bank every day or month to see if the dollars and Euros have gone up or down against other currencies. If the dollar fell against the Yen by 30% (as it has in the past) I can tell you I won't draw it all out and dump it (the dollars or Euros). The simple truth is I don't own gold for trading as so many "Westerners" do. I own it because some very sharp people have educated me about how the real world works. I fully well expect that world financial dynamics and human nature will drive gold sky
high and keep it there for the rest of my life time. For myself and my friends, we don't need to know exactly when. Whether it's next month or five years from now is good enough. The fact that around 1997, political conditions existed that could have prompted a bid for gold didn't change my plans or lifestyle. Placing a good portion of ones wealth in gold at $380, $370 or $360 didn't destroy their future or mine. I still own that very same gold today and have never sold. I have only brought more. Truly, it didn't disappear as some stocks or leveraged options did. It didn't plunge like the major mining shares did. We didn't buy gold stocks or leveraged derivatives based on any possible outcome. Nor should have anyone else in in this "new era",,,,, in my opinion.

Second, knowing what you know now, should you sell it all and buy back later. Or never buy back? Or invest in the stock markets. Perhaps the Dow will double several times over again. Is that the answer? It could be for you?

If you do decide to hold only paper wealth, you will certainly not be alone. Many people are going to sit in paper and watch and see how this all plays out. Some in the "right" investments and some in the "wrong". Where will you be?

Third, I give this insight from myself and others. It gives you a view through other eyes. All through history people have won and lost. Others have watched the ones that win and lose. I can only say that wherever you stand when the music stops, it will be a place you remember all your days. For
myself, if the Dow goes to 1,000,000, the Euro goes to 30 US cents and gold hits 5 cents,,,, at least I will know where I stood,,,,,, when the music stopped! But even then, I will not be broke.

Truly, some people cannot by nature gain by following the path of others. I can and I do.

If you don't understand my position now my friend,,,, you never will.

Thanks TG

Cavan Man (03/04/00; 20:42:02MDT - Msg ID:26382)

Sir Cavan Man,
The real unknown here is the total amount of physical gold we all hold in out portfolio. I remain vague about it because one can only buy wealth with their own understanding. None of us know how long we will live, and I can tell you it takes most of a lifetime to understand gold. So it's best to buy a percentage equal to what you can grasp. With the rest do as you say, buy land and other
forms of wealth.

Just as I mentioned to Golden Truth in what I believe is the proper perspective, gold is not an investment. It's buying another form of long term wealth. Yes, I'm certain that all the items I point out will eventually impact gold for the better. But I don't buy it with the perception of making those forces work for me through trading. Once one does that, you lose the ability to see it as a wealth
holding. It becomes an investment you can win or lose with. Or worse, we leverage it. Then it loses all the fine attributes a hard wealth holding was intended to have in your portfolio.

Many, many people have learned that bitter lesson. We only read and hear about the wise people that "just brought that mine share" around it's lows. Not too long ago! And if they had it earlier, they were smart enough to "trade it" using moving averages and "Comex traders commitments numbers". It seems everyone will admit to the "little loses" but will never tell you the whole story. That is that their current "gold investment" would really have to go up 1,000% for them to just get even from all the "little loses" (and in truth big loses) they took over these last many years. Still the song is sung about their recent 50% gain they just made. I just (smile)!

We only point out the Euro because it's dynamics are what will impact gold the most. A Euro account will only benefit you if you can live abroad. I can and sometimes do. I don't present it as a "trade", it's a possible bank account or demographic unit one may want to hold some of their wealth in. As an American, I have always presented physical gold as the very best way to protect our other wealth. For myself it is a great portion of my wealth.

I also present from the position that our present paper gold market has in itself leveraged the actual physical market. If the dollar paper market fails, it will make physical gold rise in the greatest percentage. Further, the inflation of all dollar assets are what creates an even greater leverage against physical gold.

In this position I am not a "gold bug" in the modern "western sense". They are almost 95% in paper derivatives of gold. Gold stocks included. Here, I am truly in the minority. Actually, if one looks around world wide, official physical gold trading is less than 10% of paper gold trading. Off the records it's huge.

Again, most of the paper is put in play by dollar based traders.

I hope this further expands my views (smile), TG

Solomon Weaver (03/04/00; 21:15:43MDT - Msg ID:26384)

Hello again Sir Weaver,

You write:-----I will agree that if distortions in the paper pricing gold market drive the price down dramatically, the classic result will be for the price of gold mining cos to fall too...but in the end, these companies are not producing paper gold ... they are producing real gold. We should also
remember that when the paper POG falls below the cost of production, unless miners have an outlet to get a "real price" they will simply stop producing.--------------

TG:
In the end, could be yes and could be no! You know how a true forward sale works. So, if contract gold falls far enough and interest rates spike high enough,,,,,,,,,,,, their banks will force them to forward sell below production and let the rates on the "portfolio pool" bring their cost back to break even. This selling further puts pressure on the contract prices.

Then there is the political agenda. If the mine means enough to the local economy, the government could carry the shortfall by carrying the "pool note" at an even higher rate.

--------It is also not really in the interest of the short sellers to drive the price way down...just keeping it tame where it is is enough to keep their books in line..as a matter of fact, as the paper and physical markets begin to separate, the shorts will look even better, since the paper POG will fall dramatically. Until counterparties tell the shorts that they have to "go into the new physical
markets to buy back"!!!!-------------

TG:
Solomon, these modern market sponsors mostly do not actually sell gold short in the old sense. They write contracts against their cash equity. They don't even think physical gold, they think in cash settlement terms. If someone shoves cash at them and says write contracts, it's done! Gold isn't part of it. Indeed, the lower the contract price sinks the less likely any counterparties are to call for gold. Because, if,, and that's a big if,,, any physical callers are still in paper by then, they know a big call is an invitation for arbitration, plain and simple. Today, starting Sept. last year,,,,,, this market became a huge cash settlement arena and all the big players know it. The few physical sales (BOE and Dutch) are but little band aids that are used to manage it to some degree.

-------I look to the BIS to be the "new market" in a crisis. When they see that the Yankee market is locking up, they will be the default for large parties who want to sell or buy real gold. They will do this because they will want to stabilize the bipolar currency market (dollar/Euro) to allow an"organized slide" of the dollar. At the BIS (or the market backed by their name), mining companies (who have material free from hedged contracts) will be free to deal with gold buyers. Euroforces will have a vested interest in showing a publically traded real price for gold both in Euros and in
Dollars. ------------------

TG:
I mostly agree. But, mining companies free from hedged contracts are not out of the woods by a long shot. The present group of Bullion Banks finance virtually all new mined gold from beginning to end. Don't think for a minute that a BB in deep water because it's paper market is sinking will let it's mine clients just sell their gold wherever they want.

If the world contract prices are in the dumps, and a physical market is not considered "legitimate" yet (as in not the true price or black market), all mine valuations will be in the toilet. Pardon my french! In this brief atmosphere, banks will have a free hand to seize assets and force financing at will. Plus all the government intervention that may happen.

My point is that the risk of investing in most gold mines is far greater than the perceived reward. That's because most investors rule out a great rise in physical gold while seeing only the positive side of the stocks. At best, mines have ten times the risk of gold with only a small possible gain premium. Yes, under some possible workouts they could soar. But tell that to the people that own mines today that are on the edge of shutting down.

As Mr. Eastwood would ask "You just got to ask yourself,,,, do you feel lucky?" (big smile)

---------I don't really want to be walking down to the bank with my gold coins to cut a deal...-------------

TG:
I agree, it would be far more profitable in selling only a little of your much more appreciated gold to MK and using that proceeds to pay off the mortgage. Thus having extra gold already and not having to buy bullion later with cash (another smile)

Solomon, I hope my views offer a different perspective for yours and others thoughts.

Indeed, the paper game could be just about to unwind now! You are so very right to say-------------------
" " Dont buy paper on the dips, cause its a shell game " "!

Gold has been in an unfolding story line for several years now. We have tried to isolate political and private movements that would impact the price of gold even sooner, as it travelled along it's destine path. But with each twist and turn the coming gold crisis was controlled with no perceivable change. At least not on the surface.

Oil always was the catalysis that would eventually begin the impact phase on gold's future. Whether it cam from outright intervention in the physical marketplace or by destroying the house of dollar credit with a large price rise,,,,, the dynamics of oil would eventually launch the Euro into reserve position. During that currency transition, physical gold would literally soar in price! Taking with it the entire financial structure of most of the dollar based banking system. Including most of the gold Bullion banking process.

With oil now above $32, it looks increasingly likely that we are about to start this process. With this in mind I repost an old piece. Perhaps I will also place it on the Trails page to remind everyone exactly how myself and others will be positioned for this turn of events.

It should be obvious to all that I am not a trader. I do not think Another is either. Most of the observations given are offered to instil a path to follow for research, not to direct. Most gamblers (traders) try to find private information and act on it before it is common knowledge. Greed is the main motivation, certainly not the expansion of ones knowledge or protection of wealth. We often see people blindly follow the words of others without creating their own logical conclusions. No one will ever successfully manage their family wealth in this manner. Indeed, many have used the leverage of paper precious metals (including the white metals) to create great losses of wealth. Yet, Another has always striven to put the average citizen into physical gold as a percentage of their net worth. If you follow in the footsteps of giants, you gain proportionately as do these conservative people. My agenda is found in offering others an agenda that will hold true in a changing world.
Follow the news, think for yourself, observe the outcome of events in a different light. I think you will find this an interesting story as it unfolds. Yes, it is slow, but it holds true! The game of chess has many outcomes, but the objective is always to complete the journey with all of your

It's not easy to trade an impending currency crisis. Especially one in the making for so many years.
I submit that all the contract forms that this gentleman tracks will soon become a whirlwind. We shall see!



From Mr. KAPLAN'S web site--------------

QUESTION:
Why are there so many recent changes to your outlook for gold?

ANSWER:
Rarely are there so many conflicting signals.

Sentiment is somewhat bearish, but not markedly so;

fundamentals are improving steadily, with unexpected setbacks;

commodities as a group remain strong, but a few key ones are still in danger of a pullback;

the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar are acting oddly;

the Australian dollar looks as though it is recovering and then moves to new lows;

technical indicators indicate an important pivot point but are less clear on direction.

Hello Cavan Man,
If the hard portion of your investments were like their 50% (or larger or smaller) in bullion (or even gold stocks and options). Now say they went to zero for a while, would it change your lifestyle much? Could you sleep at night?
Or if it went sky high,,,,, could you stand not to sell for a while?
It would not change anything for me. So my position and perception of this market is right,,,,, for me.
How about you?

A Fireside Talk

We have walked a ways since our last chat, 03/02/00. Let's expand on what was said in each of these rambling talks.

"Introduction Post"

To understand gold we have to look at it through worldly eyes, in a very "broad context". This is important because gold has a better history of storing true net worth over people's lifetimes. More so in a generational sense, not just in the decades span most of us choose to see it in.

Even though fiat currencies often record it as a poorly performing asset in the relative short run, it has far outperformed every paper money system. That's because every paper money system has eventually died from old age while gold lives on.

During both the short and long haul, physical gold is wealth insurance for our extended families. This holds true because even holding gold in the early successful stages of a currency's life, war, politics and natural disasters can work to destroy any nation's assets. This includs ones personal wealth that's denominated in the business structure of said destroyed society. Gold mines included!

Over time, one could never compare the returns of investing in stocks and bonds to owning gold. This is simply because when gold is entangled in currency schemes, it's fiat value is falsely presented while the currency system ages. Only the commodity use of gold is reflected, not it's much higher wealth "reserve asset" function.

However, this present era has become one of those unique periods in paper money history when gold will take a great leap in value during the relative short term. Perhaps we can define it as being between 1990 and 2010. Having covered the accumulation phase of the first ten years already, the next five should be one for investors to just sit back and watch. The last five will be a time where we spend some of our physical gold wealth.

This will occur in a transition from an ageing currency that's still entangled in gold valuation schemes and politics, into a new currency reserve system that's positioning itself to let gold run. In this new venue, we are going to see gold become a world class "reserve asset" that's not tied directly to any official money system.

Again, once physical gold is swept clear from paper moneys, it's value in real life terms will soar.

The modern gold era never changed. Banks lend the currency that is invested in South Sea - like companies. Then the companies and governments create ever more currency debt at the request of the populous. At first the currency is a receipt for gold, then it becomes a receipt for more receipts. Then more currency is created to save these same failing debts receipts, but no gold is there to back it! The endless cycle goes on, all the while hiding our modern value of gold in the process. As the game reaches the end, we even begin to think that the "natural things" and "real things" of life are not the only wealth. Rather, a contract can also be held as one's life savings. It will end!

As paper debt increases, it ages the currency by always generating more "fiat receipts" than human production can ever service. Then, at the end of the "currency timeline", in a great flood of human emotions, we reach for "natural conclusions" to a non retractable financial problem!

One of the conclusions we reach are that physical gold can replace the lost values we once placed in fiat debt and equity, even the loses in paper gold and gold equity! In this drama these same fiat values that we once traded as wealth receipts can no longer be valued at par with real earth things. Once at this point we reach for natural real wealth on a epic scale.

In the process the entire society, including the government structure and it's outgoing money system are all carried with us in an emotional flood to the sea. Sweeping away the whole format of our worlds currencies and real wealth. We will watch this new format unfold.

This is why so many fail to see why one should hold physical gold at this time, in this closing era. They ask, why now? What is different from 20 or 60 years ago? Seeing only the jewellery value of gold in contrast to past official fiat currency rates (dollar at $42 in gold) as enough appreciation to be fair. We think a move to $600 is enough and invest for that outcome. Locking ourselves out of the real surge.

These questions and perceptions arise because we can only review the recent history of gold. As such it was unnaturally priced in the fiat currencies of pounds and dollars, not traded "next to the currencies" and valued as a "real wealth" "reserve asset". In a price discovery process such as is coming, gold in the past would have reflected all the great wealth advances that have happened sence the early ages of European gold coinage.

Again, for most of us this recent period offers only a fiat value comparison and leads us to accept it's present low fiat valuation. Yet, gold's fiat values over this era were only relative to it's manipulated price during an extended Anglo-Saxon currency timeline. A period that saw the dollar take over the pound's role of representing and dominating all world wealth. Including gold wealth!

During this whole period, gold's value did have small shifts up and down. Even our recent 20+ years are representative of these small shifts. Yet, because of our fiat perceptions we see these moves as large bull and bear runs for the metal. While all the time a truly great value leap in gold was building, waiting for the present dollar lifetime to end. Once the dollar gold entanglements are ended, gold's relative worth in modern world wealth and production abilities will return. In our modern day, the old adage that "gold is worth a mans suit" will prove far, far too low a value.

While we think about this, I'm going to eat some fresh trout. Then, tonight, under the stars we can come closer and extend the next "Foundation post" and others.

A Fireside Talk (continued)


Hiking a gold trail usually requires us to ramble on as we walk mentioning any points, commenting on good views and taking notes as we proceed. But, after the end of several days on a trail, around a quiet fire, we put it all together. This is the format we take. Our first fireside talk was just posted. It and these (continued) posts will expand on our walking "Thoughts" before we continue the hike.

"Foundation Post"

From several viewpoints we proposed the same question: Why did so many of the world's nations continue to support a dollar reserve system after it went off the gold exchange standard?

They definitely had a choice; continue to use the dollar or go back to using gold. They choose to use the dollar! I pointed out how this policy flew in the face of common sense, and especially did so as the US only embarked on a policy of continued monetary expansion. In effect, inflating the whole world's currency systems right up into the end of 1997.

My point was that their actions can only be justified from a position of "buying time". Most of the major World and European countries had economies and currencies that could stand on their own in a competitive world. Yes, their transition from a dollar reserve would have been painful. But, compare that loss to the percentage of lifestyle gain they paid as a tax to the US by artificially maintaining the dollar exchange rate. Their Central Banks support polices were a decision to waste their citizens productive efforts in a process that held together a failing currency system.

They could not be this dumb! As I pointed out in the Foundation post:
-----For the more developed gold owning countries of the G-7, they had a different question in mind. Again, if taking in inflated dollar reserves was the act of importing US dollar inflation into ones local economy,,,,, and in the process creating a market for your goods overseas,,,, why not just print your own currency without taking in dollars - - In doing so give the same buying power the US citizens have in your market,,,,,, to your own people?------------
The other side; why not create a market for your own goods by selling them to your own citizens, using your own currency as a reserve?

Clearly, after 1971 the result of a failed dollar reserve system would have delivered a healthy dose of "real" price inflation to the US. Not just the 10% or 13% we experienced! But at least for the major European countries, with their money systems expanding on their own over the next 20+ years, their citizens would have brought their own lifestyles somewhat relative to their efforts. At least this was more reasonable than paying slave taxes in the form of dollar support. Or maybe it wasn't ?

Indeed, the whole world would have slipped further down the inflationary scale had the dollar failed. Everyone's lifestyle would have slipped a lot more than it did. More in the US, less in Europe. But more importantly, the whole international house of trade would have slowed tremendously without some form of world currency reserve. It's possible, that once we left the reserve system, the return to an increasing momentum of world trade flows would not have been seen again for several generations. Such is the case a world financial fracture on this scale could have created.

Yet they didn't return to gold! In the eyes of many, gold had been discredited as a controlling force that could regulate world finances and trade flows. Yes, gold was an option then, but we had just seen how modern superpowers can just walk away from the discipline of gold. In my post:
----Even if we have a pure gold system, human nature will find a way to turn it into securities. In doing so we will - - come hell or high water - - lend more gold than we have and borrow more than we can pay back. One has but to return to the history books to see it all in plain print. Over and over again, we start with a solid gold foundation and soon degrade it into trash. It's not just the American way,,,,, it's the world's way. ------------------
It seems the only explanation for the continued support of the dollar came in the form of "buying time": time to recreate a world reserve currency. But this time, make it subject to a whole group of diverse nations of conflicting political wills. In this format no one country can call the shots for the world. In addition, take away the need to compete with gold. Let gold be a supporting "reserve asset" that trades in a free market, unlent and non monetary so as to circumvent it's manipulation.

In this position a modern digital fiat currency can only represent the productive efforts of the nation blocks it represents. No different from the fiat schemes we have endured for 60+ years. Only this time without an illusion of gold backing and it's discipline. As such, a free market for gold will, on a ongoing basis, constantly devalue any and all currencies of the world. Just as in a somewhat similar concept where the stock markets of the world today currently discount the inflation of their local currencies.

Perhaps the payoff will be worth the past sacrifice of so many productive assets and savings. Perhaps we will never know just how far the world would have sunk had they written off the dollar back then. Without that knowledge as a measuring stick, we cannot compare if the recent loss was worth it.

Today, dollar support is winding down in the growing shadow of a Euro currency. This will eventually have a tremendous negative impact on all paper assets denominated in dollars. Whether they are viewed as hard paper assets or soft, the coming price inflation will wreck the use of dollar trading vehicles. Hard gold, owned as physical gold will make all the difference in the world.

Next, how oil was used to mask the motives of building the Euro, even as it supported it's creation. We will next extend the "First Walk" post. But first, more logs on the fire.

A Fireside Talk (further continued)


Expanding from the: "First Walk Post"

Many political problems confronted any drive towards an EMU. In order to build a consensus for a Pan European currency, the architects had to have time, years of it. The last thing they needed was a world-wide economic downturn brought on by a failing dollar system. Working between 1976 and 1982, the software for such a system was only just beginning to really take shape. It was a slow, hard process because during this period and many years prior, the dollar was already experiencing convulsions. They needed at least another ten years, but without something to make the dollar more acceptable even five years was too long.

Working within a large group of nations required painstaking discussion of all ideas out in the open, so their agenda had to offer something for everyone. In addition, this new currency could not be seen as a competition for dollar use, otherwise the US would most certainly try to split the group.

It's important to understand that most of the world wanted to at least see another currency that could share some of the dollar's function. It didn't have to replace it. To this end, most every country gave some philosophical and political support in it's creation. But, by supporting a dollar that was now completely removed from any commodity backing system, would require the help of some major players.

Another group was extremely interested to see how this new currency would turn out. The major world oil producers. Prior to 1971, they were secure in selling oil for US gold dollars, even if it's true worth in a modern oil economy wasn't completely understood. At least gold had a long history of eventually defining it's value as equal to modern advances. Better said, if oil did more for the economy, then that increased value would be reflected in a stable value of gold. But after 1976 they found themselves selling a resource for far more than they realized it would bring and doing so in dollars of unknown future value. In the unfolding economics of it all, these people saw the same thing we did.

From my "First Walk" post:
------Prior to the US going off gold in 71, our whole (USA) economic structure was expanding because we were gaining massive leverage through cheap oil. Back then, oil was literally changing our lifestyle for the better, and doing so because it's dollar price was so incredibly low relative to what science was doing with it. Modern science had made oil worth so much more than we paid for it, we could extrapolate our debt and money supply growth far into the future and still figure that productive increases would cover it (the lost value due to money inflation). In effect, the US was targeting it's economy and money value to future oil flow value, not gold.-------------
After 1976 they (oil producers) jumped into gold but soon found that their excess dollar flow could never even partially be shifted into gold as it was traded on this new commodity arena. For them, gold wasn't just a "trade", it was payment in the form of real "reserve assets". Oil assets for gold assets! If the CBs hadn't sold into the storm, gold would have went to the moon from oil flow alone. So they, and everyone else soon found out that there was a world of difference between trading "gold dollars for real gold" at your Central Bank and "buying commodity gold in a trading arena". In truth, the gold market was only a free market for commodity trading. It was never allowed to trade as a "wealth reserve asset".

The options were few. Buy gold outright and see it's price run past it's "money for oil" value, or include gold in a currency basket for payment of oil. In essence saying: "straighten this currency problem out or you will be the one buying high priced gold"! They optioned for a third way. Continue to sell oil for ever cheaper dollars, all the while waiting for something to replace the failed reserve system. So they watched as the US said they would fix the dollar and Europe said they would replace it.

It was clear that the US would continue printing money as long as it got oil flow at a price that created an increase in American lifestyles. To this end, the dollar economy would eventually crash if oil was not priced cheaply in dollars. In addition, pricing oil in a currency basket with gold would just as easily crash the system. It was here, between 1980 and 1985 that both the US and Euroland proved that they could keep gold on an even level if oil could play the game.

Higher oil prices had indeed brought forth more oil flow and crude reserves for the US. This alone did wonders to extend the US dollar economy and the extra load of debt it was building. From this position alone, producers could justify supporting dollar settlement for oil, but only for a decade or so. The US and Britain were busy building a contract gold marketplace that would channel money away from real gold, thereby freeing up more physical to partially exchange for excess world dollars their oil imports produced.

Still, this didn't explain all of the game. It brought time for the EMU to build, but who was going to carry all the eventual excess dollars that would flow from a booming US? By 1986 a booming US economy was the result of still cheap oil. It was being sold to them and everyone for expensive dollars that flooded the world in an ongoing trade deficit!
From my "First Walk" post:
------It worked in a broken pattern for a number of years. Oil and gold defied all predictions of higher prices as they retreated from every advance. Central banks gorged themselves with worthless dollar reserves and prevented a hyperinflation of the dollar in the process. They did this, because they knew that gold had the ability to completely replace any and all loss of dollar reserve value once a new system was in operation. -------------
In this new format (post 1982), the US and it's dollar system would only work if oil was sold to them cheaply and in dollars. It's no secret that cheap oil is created by opening the valves. But, dollar settlement without gold was a political agreement just waiting for a reason to change it's mind. Foreign Central Bank support for the dollar was the key that kept this temporary condition working. Still, without the added kicker of a world cheap gold price along with a significant revaluation of that gold in the future, oil would have went for settlement in a Euroland basket of currencies + gold, long ago.

The US had already proven that it could not be trusted with any form of gold currency. At least most of the major European countries still had a good record of trusting gold. This is where we saw the impact of oil in the building process of the EMU. If they were to be at least attracted to a new Euro system, it had to accommodate a new attitude in dealing with gold. They looked at the 1976 "Jamaica Accords" and said, "why not use it as it's written, keep gold as a "reserve asset" not a "money asset". Once outside the money system, at a high enough price, it could become a possible world oil currency without destroying anyone's economy."

These were the early thoughts that have continued to evolve through today. But the trick was in keeping the gold market functioning between now and then. It had to supply some gold to exchange excess dollars, keep the price within reason and maintain the major mining structure for supply. The last was most important because the BIS knew how the dollar faction was using gold to try to fix the dollar. Their agenda worked with the EMU process, but was outside the EMU agenda. Both factions wanted the dollar maintained, but the US was willing to sink gold if it brought ever cheaper oil. It was a short sided political process, but it brought votes.

The BIS was willing to maintain gold above $280 until the EMU. If they didn't, they would lose the support of oil for the Euro system. It wasn't just the fact that this price kept most of the major mine supply online, it was that crude at around $8.75 in gold was their bottom price.

When the Hunt brothers were going around talking about "an ounce of silver was worth a barrel of oil" they were closer to reality than even they thought. Prior to 1971, the lowest oil value was pegged by producers at around one gram of gold (at $42 that was around $1.30). At one gram per barrel today, $280 was still the bottom price. It's no strange thing that the real dollar price of oil never stayed around this level either. In any event, this was the reason for all the arm twisting in the summer of 1999. Even though the EMU was a done deal, the Euro was still too young to float partial oil settlement. With gold being driven home by the US faction, oil support for both the dollar and Euro was in limbo. The Washington Agreement not only took care of that, it officially announced to the world that the paper gold markets were ending. Indeed, it was paying the way for Euro Crude!

Today we are still on track for crude oil settlement to begin happening in Euros. Oil prices have continued the rise we predicted once the Euro was created. What is left of the gold market is but a huge paper float that's slowly losing it's credibility from the loss of over half of it's past major supporters, Euroland. To date, many of the major left over gold contracts are being shifted into Euro based settlement. It's only a matter of time until the illusion of a falling Euro is suddenly erased by a crashing US stock market along with it's dollar.

Next, we expand my "Clear Path" post. Then we will hike again, while talking about real events today.


Here are a few parts of Another's Thoughts as some time ago. They give us a different view. We are on his trail today:

6/4/98 ANOTHER (THOUGHTS!)

--------I think, over time, the gold derivatives market did "break" the control of the BIS. Gold is held by many world class entities, as a capital asset. These "Giants" did understand the purpose for $350 gold. In this range, the gold mining industry and many capital reserve gold assets would survive. Gold below $300 was not wanted, as even the BIS would be forced to move with the price much below $280. The last small gold war ended in the early 1980s, as the choice was to use the US$ or go to a gold based economy. No other reserve currency existed, and gold lost the war as all continued to buy dollar reserves.

Today, a new currency is formed. It offers a way to break the dollar valuation of gold without the total destruction of world-wide currency markets and economies. In time, oil producers can offer their low cost reserves at true valuations, that support industry and commerce in exchange for a revalue of real money, gold, in a real currency, Euros!----------------------------

5/26/98 ANOTHER (THOUGHTS!)

-----From the day of our birth we are taught to value all things using the one factor alone, currency! Can one contemplate the value of all possessions in other terms? Do you not have to think first as to "how many dollars is that worth" then "how many dollars is this worth" to compare two items? If it is deep within our mind, that we can know value only in terms of paper, to this I ask, can one know value at all!

The Western mind does focus on "what I buy today for the lowest price". Yet, in this modern world economy, the lowest price is always the function of "the currency exchange rate"? The Yen, it is compared to the dollar today, and used to purchase goods. One year later and the Japan offers these goods for much less, as the Yen has fallen to the US$. The currency value of this purchase, was it "true " today or a year ago? Understand, all value judgements today are as subject to "exchange rate competition"! It is in "this exchange rate valuations" that the private citizen does denominate all net worth! A safe way to hold the wealth for your future, yes? You should ask a Korean or the Indonesian?-------------------

-------One should grasp that "today, your wealth, is not what your currency say it is"! In this world, paper currency is for trade, only! It is for the buying, selling, earning and paying, not for knowing the value of your family holdings! Know this, "the printers of paper do never tell the owner that the money has less value, that judgement is reserved for the person you offer that currency to"! Again, I ask, how can we know a true value for our assets, when they are known only in currency that finds it's worth, as in the exchange rate for another currency?-----------

---------Many will "think long and hard on this", but will find little reason for this position. For it is in your history to know only "things valued in paper terms". Some say, "I hold investments of great increase these past years, and am much ahead of the inflation, if it should come". I say, "your investments, world-wide, have moved little, as it has been the currencies that denominate your assets, that fall a great deal". The price inflation that comes, it is larger than your vision can see! Your past, holds little of knowing value outside of currencies, this does block the good view!-----

-----There is more: Today, the world reserve currency holds the exchange rate of one dollar equals one three hundredth of an ounce of gold! It is this rate, that makes the dollar, not as the Indonesian currency. Perhaps a secure thought? However, even this 1/300 rate is also subject to "exchange rate competition"! This new rate was purchased by the acceptance of the "new paper gold" as equal value to "the physical gold"! This large, new paper gold market was created to increase the supply of "traded gold". The physical gold supply alone could not be increased to bring the dollar into the mid to lower 300s exchange rate area, there by making it "strong in gold". But, as in all new markets, for the "traded gold arena" to accept a "paper gold item" in great amounts, it required new collatteral / assets to give this paper item "integrity"! That "integrity" was found in oil-------

-----Some say, "gold fall because noone was buying it". I say, "gold fall because many were buying it"! They buy as the "trading market" was made "much fat" with added paper! Understand this: The US$ price of gold could only fall if a market existed for paper gold priced lower each time of offer! If the price did not fall, this paper market "could not function" as "it would not be profitable to the writer"! It was, for many years, in the good interest of all, for the dollar to find a gold price close to production cost. That time has now much passed!---------------

------One day soon, this "paper gold item" may lose it's "integrity from oil" by way of "competition" from a new reserve currency! In that day, "paper gold" will rush to become "physical gold" as "dollar gold contracts" rush to become "Euro gold contracts". You see, the value of the gold lost from the Euro CB sales will return in the form of a "Euro strong in gold". The "gold reserves" held for the EURO will offer strength, but it will be the total destruction of the dollar gold market that does make " this currency go home"!-----------

-----When the future comes, and one holds asset values in dollar terms, many may discover, there wealth was not as this currency said it was! In that day, you will know your assets, as expressed in the real money of our fathers! This new dollar/gold exchange rate will end your search for the

"the true value of gold"

Thank you

Gold only Gold
All. Forgive the darkness of my posts. I must call it as I see it in my bones. I see WAR on a world scale. Many fronts from which it will escalate from. Conclusion drawn from inate synthesys of mass psychology. Historical crowd behavior. Trail Guides dollar timeline has been means to paper over most of the worlds divisions. This has been the new world order all along. Bread and cicuses for the world. At the end of this dollar timeline when ORO's "there is no spoon",dawns, the fall will break Alice's back and Wonderland will burn.

Hello HI-Hat,,,, and welcome!

I can understand the darkness you feel. When you say "Gold only Gold" that's the right track. But I don't think things will be all that bad for everyone. Ask these questions and see how people respond.

I have never thought that the world would come to a stop. After all, we have been at this for,,,,,,, 2000+ years?? It's easy for me to say that anyone preparing for a change will come out better than the person that doesn't.
Because we have to consider this in an obvious context: ----- if the world has always been in a state of change, don't the people that prepare for change always win out over those that plan for a status quo?------

Further:

I have to ask all the people that use the "New World Order" context to explain the problems: -------when has the world not had a "World Order"? ------ When have we not been organized in tribes and nations trying to get the better of the next in line? -- When has any government not acted
for the wishes of only part of society? -- Isn't it impossible for any governing body to act in the wishes of everyone?

Let's see, people war against the "order" that's controlling them. In the process they form the "Next Order" and that "order" doesn't please everyone, and on and on! So, what is "new" about all of this? Our history books are packed with conflict. I guess seeing the world the way it really is comes under the heading of -- "our growing discovery of real life"!

Mr. Farfel does a good job of defining how deceiving we are in our dealing with each other. I agree that some of these belong in the HOF, for one good reason that they do reflect how so many people preceive the market! He point's out how many groups trade in unlawful, immoral ways to take the gold bugs money. But I point out that instead of getting out of the dark alley where these crooks operate, we stand there and dare them to do some more! And they do! Can you
believe that? (smile)

I almost get the feeling that paper gold bugs get mad because the "big they" won't let the bugs win using the paper game of the "big they". Again, so when has the world been different? Did we all grow up in a USA that was nothing but a society of saints? (Outside of us on this forum, of course! smile)

No one bothers to mention that the "big they" could not play their paper game in the dark alley if none of the "little us" were there for them to play with! To use the most American of phrases to reference one's misplaced mindset:

"Knock, Knock,,,, Hello,,,,,, is anybody home up there"???? (huge smile)

Trade with MK and you will certainly be guided into "the light" and away from most of that risk!

Leland,
Ha, Ha! Oh yes! Most Americans don't have a clue as to how leveraged their lifestyle has become from cheap oil. The price is way up in Hong Kong too. These high values that most of the world is paying has served a purpose of rationing demand for them already. In reality their
economic structures are much more stable at even higher prices than ours.

TG: I have read and re-read what you have written this past year many times. The serial along the "Trail" is teriffic. I believe I know now what you mean when you say, one should hold as much gold as, "one can grasp". The grasping is not only a tactile sensation. By grasp, you mean intellectually
"grasp".
-----------------

Hello Cavan Man,
You have that in context! Once people really "grasp" the whole concept, they will "grasp" onto a much larger proportion of gold coins. We are passing through a period of history unlike anything ever before. There is at least a 50 / 50 chance that once inflation becomes obvious in official
statistics, paper gold will be driven into the dirt! That's a 50 / 50 chance that gold paper, mine shares included will experience a drop that "no one" can stand, and I mean "no one"! Paper leverage works both ways my friend!

Paper gold can go to zero, but in the process physical gold will become unavailable to price. Everyone likes to say that if physical becomes scarce, paper won't trade either! Don't kid yourself. The less physical is in supply to deliver against contracts, the more the contracts will be discounted to reflect that fact. This market has never been in such a position before and there is no precedent for it. The major players in this game will not bid on or hold a gold contract that is heading for cash settlement. Whether it's traded privately, OTC, London or Comex.

When I read where investors bemoan how "the big boys" aren't buying gold, I just smile. They don't have a "grasp" as to why a billion dollar player would "NOT" want to buy into a market that's failing from a lack of "official" credibility. LBMA volume continues to fall away, slowly spelling the end of this era.

The good thing about all of this is that we will all get to see some real dynamics at work. Yes, it's a 50 / 50 shot! The paper markets are going to go "straight up" and die, or they will go "straight down" and die. No in between. Now those are some odds to "grasp", right Cavan Man? (big

In your much appreciated "Fireside Talk (further continued)"
I'd like to point out what I believe was probably just an oversight in your proofreading? In your 4th paragraph you state..."But after 1976 they found themselves selling a resource for far MORE (I believe you meant LESS) than they realized it would bring and doing so in dollars of unknown
future value." I choose to point this out...not as a technicality because of my familiarity, but for someone reading this with less of an understanding of the context in which this occurred and which you have written, in order to avoid any semblance of confusion.

Hello law!
Thanks for reading so closely! I fully understand your point. Your perception is probably clear to everyone as it was / is the most accepted explanation. However, the truth was that most all of them "privately" didn't completely understand just how important oil was in it's backing of the dollar's first, early debt expansion.

Years prior (before 1970) to the first big price increases (between 70 and 76), the US was changing the whole world economy on advancements in oil energy use and new products from refinement. Our lifestyles were advancing in a way that reflected $10 (in gold dollars) crude, back then. Only we didn't tell anyone (smile)!

Hell, the way the market was first structured, we had to
have the Texas Railroad Commision to raise the local prices otherwise crude would almost be given away. Actually, OPEC used the TRC as a blueprint to raise world price structures because they and most everyone was blank in trying to value the stuff in real use terms. The fact that the first OPEC increases worked as well as they did was a wonder to the producers. In reality it worked more so because the US needed the price to rise to bring in more domestic reserves. (You have read how this was done through the 71 gold closure?)

Don't get me wrong, by 74 they (OPEC) were only just learning the "real" economic value of oil to the world economy. Back then, only a few understood how the US was extropalating it's debt to reflect oil use wealth. They (US) went further after 76 and were using cheap crude to inflate the whole financial structure. Yes, it was cheap in relation to the fiat dollars we were then paying for it. Some of the producers were smarter than others and really "grasped" how oil was just as valuable as a world reserve currency backing as it was was for actuall use.

I'll expand my statement:
" " they found themselves selling a resource (crude oil) for far MORE (in commodity value) than they (had earlier) (prior to 1970) realized it would bring ------ and doing so in dollars of (now) (1976) unknown future value (because their oil was the backing for the economy the dollar was based upon) (no longer gold after the 1976 Jamiaca Accords)."

Law and others, I'm sorry I can't make this more clear, but it's a very hard subject.

Hedging your bets SLF
I am getting overly cynical, but when someone says to me that gold is a 50/50 chance of going up or down, it really means that they don't really know which way gold is headed.
------------------------

Hello tg,
In my view, a cynical "grasp" of this gold market is one where a person cannot separate between paper gold and physical gold. I agree, anyone that plays the gold derivatives game has no more than a 50 / 50 shot. I advocate the physical only game where one has a .9999 shot!

As such, a lot of old paper traders are now buying gold itself for what used to be a "paper trade"! Bars, old world coins, bullion coins and rare coins are being purchased with an eye on selling some of them at huge percentage gains later.

The big difference today is that physical gold advocates are the minority players in this game and have the largest leverage. Paper gold traders are no longer "the contrary" players as they are in a majority. We only have to look at the volume of paper trading going on around the world to see
that paper gold, in all forms out trades the physical ten to one (at least). In addition the very leverage they play for will work against them as it has already done. Truly, the paper player has just a 50 / 50 shot.

And that:

TRAIL GUIDE HOPE
-------------------------------------------

Hello Hi - Hat,
I do hope the gold market is resolved in a major "UP" spike that kills the shorts and the paper they road in on! At least that outcome will give the mine stocks a temporary spike. Remember, I own a small percentage of a gold mine also.

This would be the absolute, best way for this to resolve itself. But even in this, our present era is unlike anything before it. If we do have a paper destroying spike, physical gold will "immediately or eventually",,, at least match the mine stock run (or even pass it by -- by a hugh margin )! Making all the risk one assumes in holding paper a needless one to take. Even if the stocks outrun physical by 20% or 30% for a while, that return will not make it a "break even" for most long term holders.

I never entertained the idea that the paper markets could diverge from the physical in a down spike. It was Another that made that point about a year ago. It completely caught me off guard. But still, I made physical my #1 percentage holding because it will outperform in the long run.

Looks like the currency war is starting to impact the markets now! I'll be updating the Trails Page later.

ORO,
The interventions now should be to just slow the fall, not reverse it as in the past! The same thing
is happening in the gold market. The paper players no longer have the official support behind them.
To drive the contracts to new lows today, will require the markets to separate in values. So, just
like the PPT, the US gold faction may be just managing the movement, not controlling it.
Also,
The ME is doing a very good job of managing the crude flows. This is something completely different from anything seen in the past. I believe their security in this policy is found in the Euro, trading in the background. Eventually, the oil card is going to trump our dollar economy into a slow growth mode. Yet, this will crater the equity markets because they have priced wide open growth to continue. I suspect the only growth we are in for will be major inflationary. we shall see.

You lost me my friend? I'm not sure what your "No!" is referring to in my post?
I understand that the official word is for them to only slow (manage?) a downward drift in the equity markets. Not save and reverse it any longer. I heard this several weeks ago. Yes? or do you still mean No?

A Fireside Talk (last one before we hike the trail in "real - time" context)

Expanding some of my "Clear Path" post #9.

We are only just now arriving at a time period that will bring about "The Currency Wars". Everything prior to this was only a preparation period to build an alternative currency. The years spent traveling this road were done to prepare the world for an escape medium when the dollar finally began it's "price" hyper-inflation stage.

Few investors can "grasp" that in reality, our dollar has already been hyper inflated , but without the higher price effects. Years of deficit spending, over borrowing, debt expansion have created an illusion that the dollar was immune to price inflation. This illusion is evident in our massive trade deficit as it carries on with no negative effects on dollar exchange rates. Clearly other investors, outside the Central Banks were helping in the dollar support process without knowing they were buying into a dying currency system.

The only thing that kept this process from showing up in the prices of everyday goods was the support other Central Banks showed for our currency through exchange intervention. As I pointed out in my other writings, this support was convoluted at best and done over 15 to 20 years. Still, it's been done with a purpose all this time. That purpose was to maintain the dollar for world economic trade, without which we would all sink into depression. Indeed, the mainstay of this support required an ever expanding world dollar base. There is simply no way the old dollar debts along with the new ones could have been serviced without this money expansion.

The entire long term process is / was very clear to a few major financial players as they prepared for the dollar's retirement as a reserve. Their main strategy for dealing with this was found in several positions. One was a long term buying of real physical gold. The other was the acceptance that all trade and investments would eventually transition away from dollar use. To combat this they began to denominate their paper assets and business transactions in other currencies (now the Euro holds the main transition flow). This was done because, as the dollar prices of real things first show real signs of rising, all forms of dollar derivative contracts would begin to unravel. Better said, the process of dollar contract failure would show up in the form of discounts on these derivatives from par value. Because most of our "end time" dollar world has built itself into a huge derivative game, this discounting will occur across the board in almost everything we deal in. Not just gold.

The first signs that official dollar support is winding down is seen in real world pricing and official policy. The most obvious "first" price sensitive arena to reflect a "real coming inflation" is not gold as so many think, it's the stock markets. Their long term bull run, mostly starting around the early 80s completely reflected this official sanction of world dollar expansion without price inflation. It's only in the last year that we can see where equity markets are telegraphing a transition into dollar expansion "without world support". Better said, major price inflation is coming on a level equal to hyper status. Many stock markets have headed straight up in reflection of this.

Another area where we see this change is in crude oil. For years, every rise in crude prices was quickly shut down from added supply. Done to add the producers portion of help to the dollar support effort. Even war in the oil fields was not allowed to create a dollar destroying price rise. Once the Euro was born and seen in operation as a possible "backup" currency, added crude supply to keep prices low was no longer available. Prices have risen and fallen in a broken fashion that will continue it's upward bias. This policy change is not only a vote of confidence in Euroland, it's also a Euro reserve support function that will lead to much higher physical gold prices later. Oil around $30 (and $45+ later) now values gold upwards to $930 using the old one gram = one barrel from a pre 1971 gold dollar price ratio. This has fueled ongoing trade in gold by the BIS as it seeks more physical gold supply outside the LBMA paper contract world. A process that can only further destroy the present contract gold illusion as expressed in a paper dollar gold marketplace. Eventually, $930 gold crude will become the absolute bottom pricing range as real dollar price inflation begins.

The most recent example of official policy change toward the dollar was found in the Washington Agreement. It marks the end of Euroland support for the paper gold markets that helped maintain a dollar / oil settlement bond. In the beginning (1980s) it was a joint effort by at least two factions that has today become only a single effort by one faction. The US / Britain.

Even with this, the US accepted a reworked IMF gold structure. Because of this, they (US) are today operating two policy positions that contradict each other. One tries to use an escalation of the gold price to maintain IMF support for foreign US debt, while the other tries to keep the "gold trading desk" of several market makers solvent through an even lower price.

This places Euroland, the BIS and major world physical gold players on a direct collision course with the US backed contract gold marketplace. The effects of this will "most likely" be seen in a literal flood of new paper gold entering this arena in an effort to maintain "bookkeeping" credibility for the market makers. Today we see the beginnings of this change impacting the market as it is evolving into little more than a large paper float that exists mostly for this "bookkeeping" purpose. It will stay viable until dollar price inflation dries up to physical supply that to date still sells into this market. No doubt, the mine companies will become the very last sellers to support this arena. Possibly, selling into it's paper pricing all the way down.

For years, gold bugs have figured that gold would be the next dollar escape mechanism. Not another currency. They gave little thought to the reality that our modern world could not, would not price gold as a "reserve free trading asset" without a digital paper money reserve to do it in. Once the dollar begins it's decline through price inflation, it's use as a reserve and more importantly it's use to establish a gold market will stop. This will cause an unexpected delayed positive impact on gold values as gold's paper marketplace goes through tremendous convulsions. We may see dollar price inflation in all things, yet gold values fall as contracts fail from constricted supply. Eventually, even the mining sector will be forced from shareholder loses and poor contract price economics to abandon the dollar pricing contract system. I expect that during this time the physical price of gold will be soaring as it's lack of trade constricts supply. Most paper gold traders today, don't understand how a real dollar price inflation shrinks physical gold trade, no matter how high or low the price goes. Further, they continue to use the various dollar gold derivatives even as their paper supply mushrooms. A process that forces the contract gold price down. Yet, all the while they are proclaiming that they are "in the gold market" and bemoaning how the manipulation of the metal is giving them loses.

It's important for new players to understand that no government or private banker in the world today can manipulate the dollar price of traded physical gold once real price inflation begins in the reserve currency. A failing currency system would find governments and bankers selling into a virtual "black hole" of demand.

Prior to dollar price inflation effects, the impact of official policy can only manipulate paper contract prices. Just because traders are willing to sell physical gold for a paper settled contract price doesn't mean that's the real gold value in the world today. More to the point, this is simply a temporary condition that could exhaust itself before price inflation, once physical delivered against paper prices dries up. Thereby forcing contract prices into discount and destruction.

This modern paper market is relatively a new concept in world gold trade. It was created by banks, western traders and mine operators themselves over the last 15+ years. They supported this market by buying into it instead of buying and trading only real gold. True, the paper promoters may have been dishonest in presenting the effects of this process, but no one was forced to use it! Without user cash flow giving credibility to these paper derivatives, the market would not exist in it's present form. Yes, it's true that the Euroland and dollar faction agenda, along with oil interest and indeed physical gold traders all benefited from this investors market making cash flow! But this is reality for any investment where a buyer of a contract abrogates the security of present real ownership into a paper position with counterparties risk. Even today, call option buyers give their money away in support of this illusion, instead of buying coins outright. Truly, western gold paper traders and gold stock investors today a have evolved and in no way represent what the term "gold bug" used to mean. Today, physical gold advocates are the real gold bugs as they now posses the real leverage paper players only think they have!

To close, I offer two post from the USAGOLD forum.

The first is from Mr. Kosares and presents a true picture of how real gold flows have moved over the recent years. It collaborates my point made long ago that CB gold was never flooding the market as traders and the media thought. In reality it's been the evolution of investor use of the paper markets that have set lose so much private gold. Thereby playing into the hands of official policy.

This second post is from Mr. Solomon, who offers up a wisdom that is so very relevant to this fireside talk.

Interesting Fact....
According to the World Gold Council's Demand Trends #30 released a few weeks ago, theofficial holdings of gold were 1106.0 million ozs in 1996, and 1080.6 ozs in October, 1999.

In other words, central banks over the past four years have lost in the aggregate a mere 25.4 tons-- or a little over six tons per year.

That after countless mainstream press articles bemoaning the surety of central bank sales, the Bank of England dishoarding, Dutch and Belgian central bank sales, Canadian, Russian, Malaysian ,Jordanian sales -- and others.

What the mainstream press fails to point out consistently is that while some central banks have been selling, others must have been buying. I want to thank my good friend, Voyager, for prompting me on this subject.

I remember a comment by Another which stated that dollars (cash) was a "derivative"....at first I was confused.. but over time...I started to understand.

Money "derives" its value from what it can move.

Anyone, with half a sense for history and culture, who sits down and ponders the most recent few hundred years of mankind's developments, comes to the dizzying realization that we have developed a massively new epoch in the total history of our species...in the last 300 years we have truly tasted the fruits from the tree of knowledge..and on some levels have indigestion.

The primary common denominator to our survival is knowledge (and its partner, wisdom).

Until about 120 years ago, oil was not very valuable...but the more we discovered how to "burn" it and how to "form" it (chemicals, plastics), the more valuable it became.

Like others here at the forum, I think that gold and silver are due for a return to hard asset category, and given their lackluster performance in the last 15 years, in a time with immense economic progress, can only enjoy a solid recovery (both in price and popularity).

On the other hand, I think we all have to consider that (all paradigms aside) humanity has entered into a world where the physical survival of 50% of our population requires the continuing functioning of a very complex set of physical and economic flows. These folks live in a derivative world. Milk is in cartons. Heat comes in over wires. Wheat arrives baked.

We see the rumblings of reemergence hard-liners in China and Russia and the "idea" of future wars is discussed....The problem with this is that with so much of our ability to create wealth tied to knowledge (techknowledge), invasion of the rich no longer generate the spoils they did before. I think that if we are honest, we will recognize that the extended use of emergency executive orders by the President would accomplish the same thing as having America invaded.

Would any President really want to be the one to do this? When Roosevelt called the bank holiday in the 30's and confiscated gold, does anyone think he wanted this???? He was a decisive man, stepping into a new office where he realized we needed some real bitter medicine. Gold was targeted because it was the "accepted" place for people of all nations to "park their wealth" in pockets "outside of the formal banking system". Back then, there was no highspeed digital money,and a large portion of money was cash....today, when you move money it goes from "your bank" to "counterparties bank". It is almost a pure derivative money. Even if gold were to rise in value such that it could be valued close to the same as today's fiat pool, most of us would die quickly if the digital fiat system did not work.

We look at the divergent paths of gold metal vs. gold paper. When gold paper becomes worthless, gold metal will have value because it holds inherent credibility. But given its very scarcity, that gold metal will need "another currency" to move its value into in order to transact purchases. In a dollar crisis in a digital world, there is really nothing to gain by "confiscating gold"....the primary concern should be to keep the "remnant of the dollar economy" stabile enough that "gold will flow back into it". Perhaps I am naive to believe that our leaders will understand this...if they don't then they are not only fools they are derivatives of fools. I like to hope that this might be one of the reasons why the very intellectually astute monetary mind of Mr. Greenspan decided to stay in power...I think he may be one of the few who understand the problems of foolishness (particularly when viewed in the magic mirror made of gold).

As Cavan Man said, " "your grasp" " of the market is what will make all the difference! Between now and that $x,000 per ounce price, we may see convulsions like never before in history.

"Another" said long ago that "noone" would stand in this wind without the heavy weight of real physical gold holding them down,,,,,,,,,, "NOONE"!

Here is some of mr. Frank V's thoughts from the link above:






----------------
Frank Veneroso has been invited to speak at the Australian Gold Conference in Perth, Australia the first week in April. Some of the most noted Australian hedgers of gold want to hear what he has to say. Frank is a great speaker and I believe he understands the gold market better than any one else out there.

Frank and I were chatting today about the gold market - what else - and he now believes the move up in the gold market will be much greater than he ever dreamed of. In a nutshell, he thinks this way because of the extent of the manipulation of the gold market. Too much gold has been devoured at too cheap a price. He now believes the gold loans could be as high as 13,000 to 14,000 tonnes. They just cannot be paid back.

Frank also believes that the eventual stock market collapse will be so overwhelming and confidence in the stock market so shattered, that gold will become the "go to" investment vehicle. That is why has come to feel that the gold price will rise to heights that, heretofore, he could not even imagine - like $2,000 per ounce, or higher!

I do not know what kind of speech he will deliver to the Aussies, but I cannot imagine a good number of them not rethinking their hedging strategies by the time the conference is over.

Trail Guide - Do you think this display of reckless money flows of the past two days is the result of the Bankers (that own the BBs) and their facillitators at the Fed and Treasury thumbing their noseat the EU? Or do you think they just lost control for a while? I tend to think the latter.

Hello ORO,
Yes, I think you are right. But, I don't think they lost control for a while,,,,, we may be seeing the first signs of a runaway system making it's own rules! It's right around here,,,, at this point in the process,,,, is where the shift begins to give the Fed an "all or none" choice. Nothing in-between will do.

The whole world is calling them to show their cards,,,, right now! The real problem is that the Fed knows what is in the works as well as do I. Whether they lock down hard or "let it rip" with just a small rate rise,,,,, the dollar is going to lose it. Big! So they will try to go slow "manage it" the only way they can and that will lead to Hyper-Inflation. This time.

What an incredible dynamic to witness!

Does The Government Lie About Inflation?

Hello Stranger,
Well we may as well get used to it, because it'll be this way for the duration!

I rode the big bubble in Japan with some of my assets. From the 70s right up into the topping process (late 80s). Even felt their money flows in Hawaii real estate (Maui and Big Island). It wasn't much different from our (US) position today. It's the reason I never played for this market
run in the US. It looked the same in the beginning but it's failure will be impossible to escape from once it gets going. And it will destroy a lot more "illusion" wealth. You know, the kind of wealth that a dollar can buy today, but will not buy later.

In Japan everything ran upwards; a well located house ran up hundreds of percent. Eventually the whole lifestyle was impacted,,,, and you know what? They never had any inflation to speak of either! (smile). I think almost everyone has heard the story, but I was in it up close and from a
distance. Their market went from around 3,000 to almost 39,000 while our downtown projects went up 1,000%++++++. But the Yen was strong and always had to be forced down because all the inflation was presented as "wealth building market dynamics" . Ha! Ha!, it was a joke and everyone knew it! Rates were always relatively low, not because everyone was saving but because the system was "managing the run"!

The only reason they did not go hyper is because they are locked to our economic system. We have been the ones holding them up all this time (90s), not them helping us as so many think. Hell, they are cleaned and gutted ( I think that's how it's said). Now they are going to bite the bullet when the real dollar price inflation shows up everywhere except in the official CPI. They cannot match the dollar on a downhill run without locking their economy into the same hyper inflation.

Eventually their stock market will break upward from it's 10,000 to 20,000 base, but it will be because a steak (already high priced) will cost a years salary. (Hmmmm, time for bean soup?)

Hello SteveH,
That Crazy guy is closer that he thinks! Everybody used to calculate it that way (70s 80s), trying to understand what was happening. The trouble was the markets (both oil and gold) were being moved by political forces even though they (producers) kept tabs using the real stuff.
If you read my Trails, then you know where we are heading once this dollar inflation breaks out in the open. $900++ gold and $45 oil will be the very bottom then. Of course I'm talking about the real stuff, not paper contracts.

Hello Christopher, and welcome!
First I would like to say that more than a few investors have spoiled a good dynamic from working in their favor,,,, by trying to leverage it to death! Just as I mentioned to Stranger about the Japan run,,,,, once these human trains get going, all one has to do is throw a little luggage on
whenever she slows down! (smile) Or in this case, take advantage of an asset that everyone is buying in contract form while driving the real item down. In the beginning, no one ever thinks the investment will run as high as it eventually does. The Nikkei and Dow markets are a good example.

Hell, just about any little bit invested in the beginning became a small fortune! Gold will not be any different as it will outperform all it's paper derivatives, even hyper inflation. The trouble is that it will be doing it as it's modern contract marketplace crashes. So, getting oneself all paper leveraged up will just ruin all the fun later (smile). I copied this guy (somewhere?) because he had most of what
you read "correctly pegged"! Western thought is fixed on paper gold and keep losing wealth into that black hole because they will not "get off the train track"! Read this:

---- Most discussion is too one sided,,,,,gold share people (the real modern goldgubs) dominate the web. Gicves impression that everyone buys shares and not bullion! Between them they battle on the web. It's the Western shares against the SA shares! There is a whole world of people out
there that don't buy them! They don't need to, made enough in the paper world already!-------

OK, now to your items:

Christopher (3/18/2000; 10:33:46MDT - Msg ID:27023)

1. HOw far out is the expected event? Do I have days, weeks, or a year or two(will it coincide with the Euro in 2002?) Of course I do realize that this is just your opinion.

TG: The expected event is "right now"! Like watching a plant grow,,,, no one can see it happening while watching it. Yet leave and come back in a few months and it's bigger.

Look at it as the guy (gal??) above sees it. The opinions most of us read come from people that need that plant to produce fruit "now"! Otherwise their leverage eats up their wealth. But, all the while,,,, over these last few years they have missed the opportunity to build a chest full of physical gold at low prices. They lose money trying to time a "historic event" of huge positive financial implications,,, and miss the whole thing. Hell, the small plant has grown into a medium tree already and they "poo-poo" it because it hasn't produced fruit on their paper schedule. Just like some idiots I knew that were repeatedly blown out of the Nikkei around 8,000 because of leverage and missed the run to 40,000. We are talking about missing turning $100,000 into 60 mill. Get my point.
You have to use a broker (yes I'm talking about our host) that can help you see a conservative big picture and stay with the "big move"! Making most of your wealth while trading metal with him for the game of it! Not jumping out.


2. HOw much gold should I try to accumulate between now and then? (again I realize that this would be just an opinion, but would it be too much to ask for a specific guestimation?)

Yes, that is too much to ask because it puts you on the wrong track. We are talking about owning real wealth, not stocks, bonds, futures or options. I look at it the same way some of my friends do, like real money. I own a lot of different currencies, but they are held as savings accounts in the bank! I treat gold coins and bars the same way. Once you see it as real wealth, then ask yourself just how many dollars, or yen, or Euros, or francs is too much? It's not an investment, it's saving money wealth,,,,, money wealth that is real cheap to accumulate between $400 and $200.
Get some of those old European coins and you could be holding what was once a "Kings wealth"! For myself, any gold that is not US legal tender.

3. If and when the expected event arrives, how are we to use our gold that we have accumulated over time? Will we spend it at the grocery store, or gas station? Will we trade it in for Euros or whatever new currency replaces the $US? Or will people be coming to us and begging to trade their diamonds or real estate for a few grams worth of our wealth?

My friend, if you had Yahoo stock from the beginning and someone asked you the same question,,,, your answer? Hell, I heard that south of San Francisco, people are signing over stock to buy houses. My point is one I made over several posts, the dollar will remain the US currency for everyone to use,,,,, only it will lose a lot of value to gold.

Sir R Powell's comment on ECB doubling reserves

Do you see the raised ceiling on ECB reserves as a move to accommodate the potential for increased valuations of the existing reserves, or might it be to facilitate their direct "processing" of larger pools of foreign exchange in whatever fashion they deem to be appropriate...exchanges of dollars for gold as a simple example?

Hello TownCrier,
That is a good question! It could be either or a combination of both. They have to begin dropping their dollar holdings soon because they don't need them much longer. But there is more to consider than that.

Yes, the US trade deficit is rendering their earnings on these assets useless. What good is it to earn someone else's liability when they keep sending you more. Still they must carefully consider their next move because it will shape the US future.

They will not use dollar reserves to buy very many Euros because they don't want to stop it's building positive float momentum. If they buy other currencies it would slam the dollar and force the Fed to lock down,, driving our economic expansion into a depression,,,, stopping the exit from
dollar reserves by others. In a way like the Japan outcome so far.

The present exchange rate is a creation of their (ECB) taking in more dollars and not spending them,,, nothing less,,,,, even though they no longer need them. This is the real joke about the Euro weakness, if they only "begin" unloading their dollars, the US trade deficit, not the dollar selling by Euroland,,,, would make mush out of this illusion of dollar strength.

This is what the Fed is going nuts over. The Euro weakness is what's turning us into an inflation machine and they (fed) can't politically stop it! In my view, the big play will come as they (ECB)ask for more gold reserves from their member banks instead of buying it from them with Euros or
dollars. Then, use their dollar reserves to buy gold outside the BIS, while buying the Swiss float within the BIS using Euros,,,,,driving gold up two or three hundred and letting the paper markets dissolve.

This way they replace lost dollar reserve value but still force the US to keep it present trade policy because the trade deficit will not go away in this format without a changing exchange rate.

This is where everyone is missing the strategy,,,,,, they want the US business, but also want us to slip into an inflation on our own,,,,, by expanding our money to fund our trade deficit. You see, it's a position we cannot retract from! IN the process, the ECB could use our unending flow of dollars to buy gold? As this matures, gold in Euros will not rise as fast as gold in dollars.

Also, this is what is driving England to drop gold to save what BBs they can before the fact. I wrote about this some time ago. They are indeed heading for EU and won't need that much gold anyway. The ECB will let them in without their gold because their joining is a victory for Euroland.
Without the LBMA paper market, oil and gold will completely move to full Euro settlement. Especially if the dollar price inflation picks up steam,,,,,, and oil is doing it's best to set that fire.

-----------------------------------
Hello, The Victorian,

I have written often about my views and reasons on these subjects. But here is a quick run through:

The US will not call in it's citizens gold.
It will later encourage them to hold gold.
It will never be allowed to back this dollar with gold again.
It may create a new currency in the future.
In that process it may classify all "legal Tender" as old currency belonging to the US and call for it's return.

To Further expand on:
" " The US will not call in it's citizens gold." "

They will have no reason or precedent to do this. The dollar as well as all other world fiat digital currencies are no longer attached or legally considered gold receipts. Because the dollar was (in 1929+/-) a circulating gold loan in receipt form, and it and gold was our official "Legal Tender", they had the right to change it. Whether this was theft, right or wrong, I don't care, they did it and
got away with it. Once this precedent was established, our government gained the right to change their circulating "Legal Tender" as needed. Again,, whether right or wrong it's now outside our ability to change this.

But, I have to add that one never knows for sure what a government under preasure will do??? So just consider all of this for the record and as future context.

Today, they DO NOT have the right or NEED to call in or change any form of gold because none of it is established as "Legal Tender",,,,,,,, except new modern coins that are not collectable and are so marked (and officially classified) as Legal Money. The Eagle and possibly the Maple are.

Our position is: that the coming "Currency Wars" will pit the fiat dollar against the fiat Euro. Because of the "Jamaica Accords" any official gold held behind these currencies is only a "non - money,,,,,, non - currency "reserve asset"! In no different perspective than them holding title to large blocks of sellable land or even oil storage reserves. This gold is an asset that can be traded or sold for a fiat price if needed. Yes, we all know it will be the last thing traded in the immediate future, but later, at thousands per ounce it may become an oil currency or background official settlement reserve. If, and it's a big if,,,,, the US was to ersetablish a gold currency, this time they could only guy the gold to do it,,,,,,not confinscate it.

With that "grasp", we must consider that during these coming fiat currency wars, governments will be thinking the higher the gold price the better! Gold ownership in Euroland and the US will eventually be encouraged as a "private wealth asset" no different than stocks and houses. However, one risk could remain for US citizens!

If the US later decided to change it's fiat dollar into "fiat dollar #2", the powers that be may call in all "Legal Tender"! Again, they are not calling in gold, just any "legal currency". The future political strategy for doing this would be in a "future circumstance" context and require a small book to describe it. I will do it later on the Trails page, but it's going way out in future events.

IN any event, I buy the bars, K- rands (because they addressed this a long time ago) and low premium rare coins. To be honest and open, I buy a lot of the rare items mostly because I view them as an art form. But also: because just such a future (dollar changing) event could cause all
their premiums to sky-rocket!

So, yes I do own some Eagles and Maples and all the rest, but will not add to these positions. If I was a small holder (under say $250k), I would not change anything,,,,,, rather adjust future accumulations.

Remember, this is a forum and all of this is just thought discussion,,,,, so think about it (smile).

---------Take 20-25% off the market and the banking system is just plain caput. No more banks at all.---------

Hello ORO,
You are exactly right! With the gross number of financial derivatives written worldwide today, any major, lasting drop in dollar financial assets will leave the entire system with zero equity. This is an absolutely non - reversible fact and everyone (Mr. Greenspan included) understands it.

Read this from the link above: http://www.prudentbear.com/markcomm/markcomm.htm

----Thus far, we have placed considerable focus on money in this forum, as it is our contention that our monetary system has spun out of control and is being poisoned by unsound practices. Money excess, however, is but one critical aspect of this massive credit bubble. In fact, excesses in money creation are easily matched by excesses throughout the entire credit creation process. In both cases, Wall Street is the leading instigator-------

---------The stock market is absolutely dysfunctional and an obvious speculative bubble, fostering a breakdown in the effective allocation of capital. There are also massive trade deficits destined to only grow more extreme as imports are left to satisfy the credit induced excessive demand. We see this week that February imports into the Port of Los Angeles were 25% above last year's level. -----

TG:
Once we worked ourselves into this position there was no "political" way for the US to work the dollar out of it. Better said, it's a done deal! Our entire dollar reserve system has become a function of contract derivatives that must expand in order to survive. It's an incredible dynamic that few get to witness up close as it unfolds. It's also a deadly game that will literally eat one's assets if it falters while they are trading in it.

This is why the Fed only raised 1/4 point. They must remain behind the expansion curve thus allowing the dollar inflation to continue. This is the whole thrust of my walking the gold trail today. Others have known about this ending "dollar timeline" long ago and began preparing for it. These people (entire country systems, actually) are not trading this dynamic with an eye to make more dollars from it, rather they are positioning themselves to be "out of the way" of this train. Truly, trying to make more dollars in this is like trying to accumulate more real estate in downtown Rome just before the "Roman Empire" falls.

This is why physical gold is seen as "so alien" to most "western traders". They fail to understand (or they don't accept) how a hyperinflation destroys all wealth denominated in said paper currency. You can trade yourself into a billionaire, but cannot spend it into something of real value faster than real things prices rise. Physical gold is one of those real things that neither the currency or gold
contracts written in that currency can match. Once this contract system begins to fail by reverting into "cash settlement", the paper gold trader immediately begins to fall behind a surging physical gold price. Most think they will be faster than the markets and will cash out, jumping into physical. Thinking that at worst they will sell for, say $1,000 then buy for $1,050. But, like a dog chasing his
tail, the entire marketplace will be doing this! Once the gap becomes real, traders that use paper contracts will discount their bids that you must sell into. These spreads against physical trading cannot be arbitraged because a real shortage of deliverable gold will break the arbitrage credibility. This is the actual failing dynamic we will witness and it will mostly happen as a sudden event. Not
drawn out over months.

Forget the official CPI reports, once real price inflation comes into real view the paper markets will disintegrate with untradeable speed! Unfortunately, some 99% of the most visible western gold bugs all accept that their present "gold market" will counter match this loss of wealth. It will, but only in dollar terms! Not in real gold terms because gold will be devaluing the dollar on a massive scale. Even if the officials temporally stop all US gold trading, Euroland will allow it. Thus continuing to mark the dollar to the gold market.

Again, this is just one segment of an overall disintegration of dollar wealth as we know it. Any and all companies in real goods production will face the same nightmare as their distribution network runs head long into this dollar derivative breakup. Hence, the comming run that will take place to settle in Euros.

Gold mines are in the same boat because they cannot just walk away from their trade banks by selling gold outright, on the street corner. What bank, under gold contract stress would settle their trade? They will sell into the paper gold market through out the discounting phase until their inflation induced operations costs decimate their margins. I am betting that the only ones that will at least keep up with the return on physical gold will be the mines that can most easily restructure to sell into Euroland, for Euros. We shall see.

Back to your bookkeeping trade flows:

Good luck keeping up with it all! (smile)) The whole system is spiraling out of control now. We just call it the end of a currencies "timeline" and leave it at that. Most everyone else will eventually call it the beginning of dollar hyperinflation.

There was a lot of commentary recently about how the Fed didn't really know what money was, or how to measure it's growth or velocity. I wasn't jolted by this because they cannot lock down a run away currency and let everyone see that their breaks have burned out (or don't work). Politically, they must doubletalk themselves into a policy of "ongoing management". The only way for them to stop this is to literally shut down and bankrupt the dollar system. But, that was a political option in the late 70s and early 80s as there was no other reserve to run to. So, as the fed locked down then, everyone stayed on the train, took their loses and helped slow the thing down.

Today, everyone on this run away train is yelling to hit the breaks. The fed driver just turns and says don't worry, I'll break it hard if we go much faster. Look around and you'll see all the train mechanics jumping out the windows (physical gold and Euros) because they know if the real
breaks are hit, the dollar will just jump the tacks at this speed and wreck apart.

ALL:
So get ready to lose a substantial amount of your net worth as this all unfolds. In fits and starts, everything is going to seem to go up much higher in prices before this is all over. Yet, the illusion will fail. Physical gold will have it's day in a way that few will ever understand.

HI - HAT (03/22/00; 03:46:57MDT - Msg ID:27260)

-----------To be so removed from entropic rhythems and have our whole advanced civilization on this high of a derivative tightrope can only lead to disaster or totalitarian structures. ----------

Hello Mr. Hat,

This is a great observation, but we must accept and adjust to the flow of human will. As a nation of people or even as a group of freedom fighters, society can and does often try to change the course of history. It's a good cause. But battling people and controlling one's own wealth in times of
trouble are two different things. As wealth owners" we must guard against an attitude of "the new totalitarian structure is going to control everything and take away my stuff (in gold or whatever form), so why bother to fight that cause". For gold advocates it's usually hear as " they will take
your physical gold, so we may as well play their paper game now, and win more, before they stop it all". Hence, the promotion to "trade it" because we cannot win!

I see this attitude all over and it's not something completely new for our time. Mostly it's new because western thought is fixated on a paper defense. The outrage is expressed because people can no longer play the financial paper games they played before, without losing to the "cabal" (or whatever). In the process, they come up with all sorts of strategies to combat the "big forces". Yet, none of these strategies perform well today. These "big forces" are driving the system into the ground as they try to keep their own financial selves ahead of the game (not to mention saving the viability of the dollar).

Again, I submit that one does not have to "fight it" by standing on the train tracks and yell "don't run over me again because it's illegal". To keep holding (or buying) gold derivatives because someday, the "big forces shorts" are going to eat it, invites your own assets being served up for dinner at the time.

Buying more options, more futures or adding to that gold stock that went from 10 to 1 because it's now a "long term option" against the eventual "paper surge", begs the question: "What if the shorts don't have to cover?" What if the paper markets add even more equity to their gold short position by falling even further? What if the US banking system creates so much "free inflation" "bookkeeping cash", that the shorts have an endless supply of contract producing ability. Let's face it, as long as the paper market sets the physical price, those that have sold real gold short may not
ever be called to refund it! At least until the marketplace completely fails!

We see it all over the "Western Web". Paper gold investors want this market to coexist with a "cleaning surge" that pays off their paper positions, yet completely destroys the positions of the very people that make the market??? As such, they forget (or never accepted) that the world gold
market today is an "official illusion" built for the benefit of the US dollar. For the game to pay off the way they want will require the fed to just lock it all down. That simply is not going to happen and even if it did, no one could honor the contracts written anyway. Under these conditions, does anyone think the governments will watch the free worlds banking system melt away as they wait for the gold mines to dole out a covering supply at $XX,000 per ounce?? If you do, please stay on the tracts while waiting for the next train!

No, we are going to progress exactly as we have to date. The dollar will continue to inflate itself into the hyperinflation of all goods prices. The paper gold supply will continue to expand along with the dollar until "discounting" begins to crush it's ability to function. Physical gold will be the very best thing to accumulate as it's leverage multiplies every day under these conditions. Truly, the key to coming out ahead in this is by playing a game no one can rig. Buying cheap gold from others who accept that officials set it's price through paper trading, is like selling real estate in Rome just before the fall. Selling paper deeds for Roman gold, that is!

-------I believe that the problem is that most people do NOT know IT.------Hmmmmmmmm---

Hello ss of neap,

Well,,,,, sadly that's true. But, then this has been the case all thru history. Yet, today, nothing stops a person from buying real gold in coins. It's a clean judgment call for everyone to make. It's no different than buying a stock for $300 and watching it go to $3,000. What of the poor person that sold it to you? They didn't have to sell. Indeed, they sold because they thought it was going to $100.

My point about gold is that it's a wealth asset as old and as free as the world. You either accept humanity as being honest or you buy a little gold as wealth defense. If there has been any real deception today, it's been in the western perception that paper gold is real gold. This is where many of our modern gold bugs "do NOT know it". (frown)

Good to see you here today, my friend.

A question for you inspired by a conversation with a well-placed friend of USAGOLD yesterday. He reminds that the upcoming OPEC meeting on March 27th is exactly six months to the day after the Washington Accord announcement.

He wonders if there is any scuttlebut about an announcement being made in Vienna that the Gulf will start taking euros in payment for oil (corrected per MK, smile). The extravagant dollar printing goes on almost without interruption. The oil price rises and Europe must convert to dollars first, then buy oil at the jacked-up price -- three times what it was less than a year ago. This has to be a
tremendous burden on Europe both politically and financially, and I note the quietly proceeding talks between European financial officials and the MidEast.
What is your take on this? Do you think the March 27th OPEC meeting in Vienna will be the day the Euro speaks with new authority, or just another OPEC meeting?
-------------------------------------------

Hello Michael,
Thanks for all the effort by the Centennial people for making this such a visual pleasure. It's a class act by a truly professional team!

My thoughts:

Don't think for a minute that Euroland is suffering any worse than the US. In reality, their true inflation impact is about the same or less than it is on Americans. By true inflation I mean the real prices that regular people have to deal with. Some commentators state that we have it better, but that is looking at it using the US rigged CPI against the more honest Euro rates.

Sure, their oil costs have gone up more because the Euro is down against the dollar. But relative to what? It's a moving target that defies comparison. Oil was way down from today when the Euro came out at an artificially high rate. Did that exchange rate reflect the correct value of oil in Euros at that time? Could be yes or no because the entire Dollar / Euro / oil value comparison was / is being manipulated for an end goal.

In addition, on a fundamental basis one must consider that their barrel use per person unit is way less than ours. The result of cost containment efficiencies structured in a long time ago. Gasoline rates, commercial train use and public transport etc.., all allow them to function with higher crude while receiving less of a cost jolt. Further, these countries trade more with each other. This arrangement allows them to work with a lower Euro while enjoying it's positive effects on exports. Even with higher oil prices! The real question we must ask is why are they taking all these dollar assets and what will they eventually do with them.

Currently our trade deficit is flooding the world with dollars that have no practical purpose for use in buying anything but oil. Sure, they can and do invest in our stock and treasury markets, but that only produces more of the same currency. Further, if the fed was to do anything that would tame out deficit, that action would slam the dollar, stocks and even bond rates. In the process destroying
more value than could be gained. So gross foreign dollar holding is only a long term losing position. As such it (dollar support) must be seen as only a parking arrangement. There can be no explanation except that they have a trump card that will eventually replace any lost value these
dollars will throw off. They are drawing us into a self inflicted inflationary trap by helping the system build a dollar flood.

This is the card they are playing right now and it's the reason the US is trying to get crude down quickly. Lower crude is our main defensive policy because that's our real money killer if we don't. Long term, high dollar crude has a super inflationary impact on US money policy. Because our cost structure is hit the hardest from high oil "over time". The flaw is in our use per capita. The oil flows alone translate into huge outgoing dollar credits. When combined with an already hyper expanding trade flow, the dollars are piling up overseas like never before. We are digging our own grave, because for the first time the dollar is in competition with another reserve currency that can
withstand and prosper during a crude oil assault.

I doubt they (ME) will shift oil to partial Euro settlement yet. It would look too obvious and the Euro float is still to small. The impact would derail their (Euroland) current dollar strategy. My bet is that it will be done once real price inflation begins to impact our economy. Over and well beyond the reported CPI. Something not far away. Once the Fed is seen holding it's "behind the curve" interest rate course and pumping reserves when obvious inflation is gaining momentum, the justification will be there. I suspect they (producers) will "basket" the price first, them proceed by slowly changing the currency percentages.

If Euroland is talking with the ME about anything, gold is somewhere in that discussion. (smile) If the paper gold market gets clocked in the middle of all this, expect them to convert the gold trading center in Dubai into a physical arena settled in Euros. Hong Kong and Zurich will be hot on that trail.

So, having said all that, watch the Euro get included in settlement anyway! (smile) If this was ongoing, I know Another would not tell me. Boy, that would be something to know ahead of time, right (huge smile)!

Trail Guide...Euros/Oil
One other nuance to that question:

Do you think that the doubling of euro reserves might be preparation for such a move (euros for oil)? More gold at ECB's disposal would raise the level of MidEast interest and confidence per the anlaysis of the Gulf mind-set as posted by Another some time ago -- at least as I interpreted it.

Hello Usagold,
Yes Michael. This is part of their plan. I think the original concept (or compromise) in building the Euro was altered somewhat around 96 or 97. Gold had to be placed in a more established framework that could easily reflect a higher gold (value) price in their reserves. Fiat currencies are held as part of many nations reserves, but they are more a function of supporting the inter currency exchange rate. After EU, ECB gold reserves became more of a backing asset, outside traditional fiat reserve use.There it could later be used to settle long range imbalances in the system. Not much
different from the old gold exchange standard yet today not entangled in actual currency comparison thru fixed rates. The ECB made this a obvious point by openly marking their gold reserves to the market on a quarterly basis. They didn't have to do this. The act must be seen as having a policy purpose. With this statement alone they promoted a Euroland policy that higher dollar gold prices were fine, even good for the Euro. Further, this said that our currency will stand buy itself as a representation of our productive efforts, for better or worse. If peopled later wanted
to own gold instead of Euros, the ECB is saying, good, buy all you want at whatever price physical gold will trade at. In the future, gold prices and gold flow will be free.

This is a cornerstone for countries who's export values are mostly measured in real resources instead of human resources. It almost sets up a currency that's more suitable in reflecting their kind of wealth to the world. People today, missed the whole advantage of this. In reality, the higher the gold price, the easier it will be to buy natural resources in Euros internationally. The tradeoff comes
to countries that had the leadership to buy gold early, instead of depending on dollars alone. Oil producers will be compensated for already owning gold in that it's (gold) appreciation will return all the value stolen from them as they depleted oil and sold in dollars.

I expect the ECB to eventually own a lot more gold than they do now. Whether they buy it with newly issued Euros (using the BIS perhaps), buy it with reserve dollars or have it "transferred" from their ECMBs (through policy changes) gold reserves will be a future key item in determining the
integrity of the ECB.

Again (from an earlier post), if Euro was declared the settlement currency for oil, it would triple against the dollar overnight. No one wants that at this time. They want the Euro to be seen as strong in usage, strong in gold, strong in a hands off policy but not yet strong against the dollar. Right now, the dollar is in the process of killing itself through massive currency expansion. And doing this for the first time with a competitor standing next to it. Once real price inflation takes hold, the dollar will fall on it's own against the Euro. Without intervention.

This is the period we are just entering. Today, the dollar gold markets are in the middle of a major transition started about this time last year. The Washington Agreement only made official in September what was being changed in March 99. The oil markets are also responding to a new dynamic in world oil valuations. The fact that oil need not be locked to dollar prices anymore than gold does. The physical supply of both these items is reduced to the world markets in the attempt to more reflect their true worth in dollars.

Already Euroland values oil much higher than America. One has only to look at the gas pump prices to see this. They also value gold much higher and ECB policy alone makes this evident. Such an open policy in support of both these items cannot go unnoticed.

Today, world production of everything no longer has the dollar as the only option. If prices are unacceptable, things can be sold in Euros. In the past the oil "valve" was the only way to achieve a more honest return for an irreplaceable resource. A usable resource that paid back three times the "lifestyle" from what one paid for it in dollars. Now the US must contend with not only the valve,
but a "currency alternative" in the ongoing process to revalue oil! The adding of gold to the Euro's reserve base can only build the credibility of that alternative over using the valve.

Hi Trail Guide,
You mentioned the "US rigged CPI index" in your post to Michael I think it was yesterday. I'd like to know what "Index" would give the "REAL" picture of inflation in the U.S., especially as applies to , say, rental property over 20 years needing an inflation increase clause according to ?? Index?

Hello Julia,
Ha! Ha! My first thought would be to use any index that's always going up! Marking it to a ratio of US postage is a real winner. Let's see, an average of the spot wholesale prices of "Western Red Cedar", Kansas City delivered "Winter Wheat" and Hawaiian "Koa wood rocking chairs"!!!!!!(big smile)

Seriously,
The reality of it all is that almost every major index is somewhat "rigged". At least the ones you could get a counterpart to sign on to. Depending on the application a ratio of gross electric use and it's price can work fairly. It is a dilemma??

jinx44 (3/23/2000; 9:23:49MDT - Msg ID:27341)

Hello jinx44,

I don't know about this? Let's see:

-------The reason that politics will influence OPEC s decisions is that the current and future prices of oil are turning out to be a major economic issue and thus a major political issue. ------

TG: Yes, this is good! Oil's been political for 30 years or so. Nice recap.

--------The reallocation of wealth from oil consumers, mostly in western economies, to oil producers, mostly in developing economies, cannot proceed without affecting capital markets in western countries.------

TG: Yes, again! This must be at least the second or third time around.

-----------OPEC is a cartel and the sole purpose of a cartel is to allocate production quotas among its members as to maximize their revenues. Once a cartel starts to make decisions about production levels, which do not seek to maximize its members revenues, they lose the economic
incentive to be part of a cartel. When they have no economic incentive to be part of a cartel, they also have no incentive to abide by its decisions. Then the cartel dissolves and each producer determines production levels independently. -----------

TG: Well, the maximizing of revenues is "not" the sole purpose of closing the valve. If they wanted "maximum" money flow they would shut the valve completely off!! Then auction off the stuff one barrel at a time to the highest bidder. Boy we would see some serious "maximization" in that
process! (smile)

How about adding in: We want a fair price for the resource? Not the maximum price. Where was all the US deplomacy when oil was at $10?

Or: We want to conserve this limited resource so as to last everyone longer?

Or: Why don't the Americans charge the same price for gasoline as Euroland, in order to conserve "our" oil? These are all valid reasons to be part of a cartel also.

Further: Why is it that everyone thinks that just because you have two water wells in the ground you must pump from both of them,,,,,,, otherwise you are manipulating the supply. What if you never drilled the second well? By god, that must be some form of "cartel" also. In that context,
Arabia is manipulating the supply by not trippleing their holes in the ground. If they did, then we could triple our demand that they pump at capacity??

------------This brings us to the dilemma of the big producers in OPEC, chief among them are Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The big producers in OPEC cannot fix the price of oil unless they are willing to become the swing producers adjusting their production as is needed to achieve a certain
price level of oil. -------------------

TG: Wait a minute, he says they "cannot fix the price of oil unless they are willing to become the swing producers". He must have missed the last year or so. OPEC controlled prices recently without using swing producers. Everyone either cut production or limited their increse in order to maintain better prices. First he points out the "economic incentives" of very high prices, then leaves out the part about "economic incentives" to keep the price from falling through the floor! (frown)

------Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers in the Gulf can now go it alone and raise oil production by 2 million barrels per day, as is asked for by Washington, thereby driving the price of oil in the near term to less than 25 dollars per barrel. ---------------

TG: Oh! OK! I get it now. Washington asked them to cut production earlier so as to raise prices. So, now Washington is ready for prices to fall so they will tell OPEC to raise production.

ALL: The only delima I see here is in what the US is going to do if OPEC only raises 1.25 to 1.5 million?

Euro value as seen in Spanish Pesetas
Greetings! Trail Guide.

TG:
Hello my friend, your words:

---------You touch on a dynamic that brings no end of consternation to family discussions on the international situation between the US and Europe (Spain). ----------

TG:
Ha! Ha! You should be in my house? We need hired security at parties to keep our guest a safe distance apart! (smile)

------At the introduction of the Euro, it was not artificially high when viewed from perspective of the Spanish Peseta. At $1.18/Euro, (the Euro is pegged at 166 pesetas per Euro), the value of the dollar vs. the Peseta ($ = 140 ptas) was already slightly above its traditional level which has normally fluctuated between 98/$ and 130/$. Presently it seems determined to stay above 170 and has reached 174 more than once.---------------

TG:
Tell me, do your people feel petrol has gone up more in percentage than, say,, Los Angeles? In the same light has price inflation at the "real people" level gone up more than the US? Your guess, perhaps?

I'm makeing a point that at this time we cannot prove, but: had the Euro stayed stronger at it's birth stage, price inflation within the Euroland partners could have been worse. Because they trade so much with each other, a stronger Euro would have forced even lower % rates and gunned the economy. Prices would have went up based on regular supply and demand economics within their system. Imported items in dollars make up a much smaller percentage in Euroland than in the US. So, the foreign competition to control cost increases may not have worked as in the US. It's a strange thing, but it was possible that the ECB was somewhat worried about this. When considering a "brand new" currency, the lesser of two evils may have been a lower Euro vs Dollar initially. In this way inflation would only match the US rate,,,,, at worse???


-------Perhaps the Euro/peseta ratio was pegged at 166 to compensate for the robust level of economic activity in Spain. Nevertheless, a ratio of ±172 pesetas per dollar is really VERY high now. It reminds me of ANOTHER's comment that we would see gold and the dollar rising together
Perhaps the reality of the efforts to be expended to keep the POG down were not anticipated at that time, and for this reason, we are seeing only part of ANOTHER's prophecy being fulfilled. Your own writings point to an eventual "unglueing" of this effort. Do you and ANOTHER think that
the removal of the lynchpin presently holding all this together will be the result of a deliberate action on the part of Euroland? Or will it more likely be a gradual unfolding of events that brings about the "marking to market" of gold values that you are convinced will happen "in our lifetime"?-----------

TG:
I think somewhere in the archives I wrote about this before. Trying to reconcile it. The dollar is completely doing what no one thought it could, given the inflationary prospects of the continued US money policy. On this count Another was right in that Euro competition was driving a liquidity shortage demand for dollars even as the Fed guns the presses. This is a limited dynamic that will burn itself out fairly fast, I think. Who knows, looking at today's rates, we may have seen the dollar/Euro top?
If this is the dollar top, a gold crisis is next. I think Another gave a false perception to us about gold. He probably equated a gold crisis and a gold run in the same context?? If you remember, it was last spring (??) that he corrected me by pointing out how the markets could separate (paper vs physical). I never saw it that way untill then. How much they (US faction)can hide the crisis or hide
the true price of physical in this is up in the air now? In addition, this business of England jumping ship for the Euro and buying time for their BBs before the fact,,,,,, was a new move on the chess board.

All I can say now is that we definitely have a super inflation in the works! Hell, you can see it in the Dow alone. We might as well get used to it, because all the rules are going out the window.

I've got more "off the cuff" comments to make but have to go now. More replies to ALL tomorrow.

Paper/gold composite spot

Remember, the "spot gold price" ISN'T the true price of physical gold - - - though you can still buy physical gold at this price. The spot gold price is a composite price including both physical gold and gold contracts, the paper component implying a much greater physical gold supply than actually exists. Buying physical gold (and taking possession) at this point in history is thus sort of like paying milk prices for a bottle of cream. Almost no one else has noticed yet.

I know we all pay lip service, but at times like this, it's good to remember. Also good to remember, if TC or MK was it? was correct, most of the gold "sold" actually travels around to other CBs, it doesn't really enter the market, doesn't affect the supply/demand equation except psychologically.

Finally, if we truly want a return to honest money, the more gold actually released from the CB vaults the better, no matter what the price temporarily falls to.

Hello Journeyman,
Reading your post made me think of something I was wanting to say about the "Legal Tender" item. Many readers commented on it earlier when it was brought up.

My point about not using modern gold classified as LT comes from the 1% chance that the government may in the future proclaim all "old" LT "illegal" to possess! Recently and in the past,,,,, after an extended price inflation,,,,,,,, most countries just knock off a few zeros and print a new
currency. Declaring that they are phasing out the old one at some specified date.

But I sense that here in the US, they may want to "suddenly" declare all LT illegal to use and own. The reason for such a policy would be to trap the majority of "cash" users in a position where they cannot spend their holdings before the fact. Whether cash owners keep cash to hide money assets
or ill-gotten gains, these holdings would be flushed out with such an action. Of course this would be a "state of emergency" action. But they could come up with some scheme to temporally make us tender our cash for "bank credits" until a new money was made, after the announcement. This way
no one could prepare for the usual "turnover" process, by knowing in advance that a new currency was being printed.

I know,,,,,, I know,,,,, it's a strange way to see it, but I believe it's a real possibility. We have to understand that this would not be aimed at gold ownership, just hidden LT ownership. This is mostly because hidden cash is, as some commentators write, is more than anyone can count. In the
mean time, Eagles would be inadvertently sucked up in this maelstrom because they were classified as LT. I have even read that this was a preconceived trap, laid on the American people in an effort to placate their bullion desire. Yet, still allowing a backdoor way to grab their gold for other
reasons! Reasons outside the legality of a gold recall, that they clearly cannot do within he current dollar status.
More likely than not, we would be able to replace our called in gold, but with privacy lost!

I feel like a conspiracy nut for saying this, but it makes some sense.

Further:

Leigh made an excellent point (hello Leigh) in that one could just melt them down. Absolutely true, but what a needless mess, no? Anyway, I pass this on in it's abbreviated form for all to consider.

Someone else also asked how one could store a very large gold holding. Well, we have to accept that once one's wealth becomes large, it's impossible to hide. This has always been the case. We just place the bulk of it in accredited storage and keep what we will privately. I think we all have to
remember that the truly wealthy people in both the US and the world, all have gold! In addition they are not as stupid as the media print them as. CNBC could parade a countless number of billionaires on tv and never once would any of them say they own gold. In fact, they would go out of their way to say how dumb an idea it is!

My point is that most of the world leaders, your congressmen included, have gold that they would never admit to. Once we left the "dollar being gold" world, they all started down this trail. In addition, none of them own gold as a bet on it's price movement, they hold it as insurance. This said, we must understand that in the end, when push comes to shove, they will not pass laws that damage their own interest! Trust me, their own interest has always been above ours (smile), don't you agree!

Journeyman, I do have a reply on your post. Will have it in a minute.

--------------------------------------------------
Journeyman,

What MK wrote about total gold in the CBs is absolutely true. I agree with him in that we read so very little about this statistic. I think it's because it obliterates most of the theories about how the CBs are killing the gold price by selling off this unneeded asset.

I and Another pointed our countless times that the CBs were mostly playing the BBs against the market by giving "gray guarantees" to protect their (the BBs) paper positions. In reality the whole thing is a political thriller every bit equal to any 007 film.

The truth of it all is that they could never control the value of physical gold and because of this kept most of their holdings in tact. I would even go so far as to say that much of their draw down is an illusion.

We must remember that selling a real asset to the public for cash does not control anything. You get the gold, they get the paper money. It's the same for crude. The price is what you get real oil for. The lower the better. Just like gold, a lower price imparts the benefit and use of the product to
the buyer. Indeed, a lower price is the loss is to the seller. Through out this 1990s gold downturn, what physical gold the new buyers obtained was to their gain. There was no control at all, the buyer gained the gold!

What this modern gold market can control is the value of contract gold. Here they (BBs) do an exceptionally fine job. They sold paper gold to everyone that wanted to only bet on it's price movement, not buy gold. To this end, they took everyone's money and the buyer got nothing in return. Yes, it did play an important role in supporting the dollar while the currency world was in transition. Just as our USAGOLD writer SteveH has said, this gold industry and the contract
market it services was sacrificed. But, look at what would have happened if they didn't. Indeed, the time brought was purchased on the backs of gold bugs, not physical gold advocates. One ended up with depreciating paper and the other with an ages old world class money. This isn't the first time citizens of the world such as Farfel learned that "betting" and "owning" are two different things. It won't be the last!

This country is diving head first into a grand hyper inflation and no amount of Fed maneuvers will stop it. People that learn this early on, before the physical comes into short supply, will be miles ahead. Buying gold between $400 and $200 will be like knowing a member with Masters Tickets. Cavan Man, do you know me better now?

I'll work on the next hike now. We are packing up for the real thing my friends! Get ready.

Walking The Trail
http://csf.colorado.edu/forums/longwaves/mar00/msg01356.html
Hello everyone!

It's been a few weeks and it's time to stretch the legs again.

During these last few days I have seen several renditions of my discussions from the USAGOLD Forum circulating around. Good! Glad to see it being thought about. I just wanted to let it be known that this was a collection of several of my rambling posts. They were strung together and included some commentary of ORO and a few other good posters there. I don't know who put this together but have seen THC, Singlion, Sharfin and a host of others posting it all over. With a title of "Selling Paper Deeds for Roman Gold" it does truly hit home for gold advocates today. Food for thought in a hungry world. Thanks people, for adding your own special flavor to the currency problems we consider today.

http://csf.colorado.edu/forums/longwaves/mar00/msg01356.html

Onward

Every time the dollar price of gold is driven down we hear cries of despair all over the web. Understand that these sounds you hear are not really the noises of physical pain, rather it's the ages old wale of one person giving his wealth to another and getting nothing in return. (frown) As "Gold Advocates" we hear these same as signals that indicate more free assets coming our way. As Real Gold buyers, the feast only becomes larger and our real wealth greater! (smile)

You see, a Gold Advocate looks at gold as a wealth currency and continues to accumulate it at any better price. Follow those that "mostly" invest in Paper Gold or even the "Gold Industry" and one can only see where more losses are coming at these lower prices. Some gold mines may be a good buy here, but not many of them.

Some moaners place gold as a downtrodden relic and swear never to invest in it again. Yet, from our view, they never purchased "gold the currency" in the first place. Their idea of "hedging their wealth with gold" included a wholesale buying into the concept that "paper gold" was "real gold". It never was and never will be. Paper trading only works while the paper world stays together. A dynamic that is unraveling now!

There is a big risk difference between betting on the price of gold for a short run profit and buying real wealth currency for a long term crisis event. For myself, the largest difference will be in the real wealth gained in the future, not today. Over the last 15 years political gold policy has caused paper players to walked the gold trail like drunken sailors. As a result their assets have done likewise. One step forward in the little gold paper runs and two steps backwards while waiting for the next move. All the while giving away their dollar wealth with nothing to show for it when the real run comes. In the end, they will sober up only to find that they made little progress as most of their "gold" investments brought them full circle. About even if they are lucky! Yet, bullion holders will experience gains that make almost any investment today look tame.

Look over here

The currency of gold hasn't done nearly as bad as paper traders would have us think. As a person of the world I own many currencies (dollars included) and all of them go up and down as much as gold. Some even more so. Because gold is but one very large currency holding for me, it takes on an exchange significance.

Using very approximate values:

In January 1985 one dollar would buy 1/300 ounce of gold. At the same time it would buy 3.25 German Marks and about 250 Yen.

Ten years later, by 1995 one dollar would buy 1/375 ounce of gold, 1.40 Marks and less than 100 Yen.

Here we have two world class currencies moving well over 100% against the dollar! Yet, gold was more stable as it moved only 25%. From Jan 1999 gold has been even more stable than the Euro, today resting within 5% of it's value from the Euro starting range.

My point is that today, all currencies will run up and down in their race to full fill a fiat's destiny. Yet, in the process their percentages moves could be temporally far greater than what gold moves. Making gold look like the most stable holding of all. Even as paper gold bugs cry about how it's crashing?

In this light we must all consider ourselves like insurance companies writing risk policies by holding paper currencies. The higher the movement risk, the more interest we must receive to hold our wealth in paper form. Indeed, just as an insurance company is lucky in good years to balance it's exchange rate loses against the same interest return, currencies are not that great a deal in today's world. Physical gold becomes a fine wealth holding that pays a much higher premium than any fiat currency. It's zero interest is "high" in relation to the default (inflation) rate inherent in paper money. In the future, some will even pay a "negative" rate in the paper markets to try and acquire gold through legal force. This is called buying a gold contract in default and trying to force the counter party to produce gold. Some will, most won't!

For all of you with a mind for intrigue, the game is now on to buy gold at negative rates. ORO, the SDR is telling your story. (follow his past discussion on the USAGOLD Forum) If the US would just stop pushing paper gold boulders down the hill,,,,, and stood and watched for a while,,,,, they would see that the avalanche now has a mind of it's own and needs no help. The whole paper gold mountain is on the move. (smile)

Further we walk

All of the massive tonnage of contract gold that is owed today was never as real as investors thought. It was an illusion of paper supply. Most of the gold sold by the European and other world CBs moved no further than the next CB vault. The gold trading world brought this "physical selling" story in it's entity and in the process supported the dollar's life.

Today, Europe is the greatest supporter of "Freegold" the world has seen for some time. As they act out their policy, the paper gold marketplace as we know it priced in dollars will fail. The completely unexplainable gold sales by the BOE are only a means to this end. They are much more concerned about joining the Euro and saving some BB face than any longer saving the dollar.

The US is now "in it" alone as they have lost the dollar war and the "oil war". Crude oil will not stay in this new dollar price range for long. This was politically arranged to somewhat save US face. We (US) are now calling in every favor, expending the last political capital and inflating the dollar in an end run that will soon lead to nowhere. A grand hyper inflation of prices is now directly ahead on the trail. It should be ushered in with a large "crackup" in the currency derivatives market. Once this event is "in process" the paper gold markets will quickly rush to discount against physical gold. A discount that will break our gold market pricing and physical allocation system.

Understand that the largest gold rush will be from the paper gold arena into real gold. Any form of asset allocation that took the form of:

" "hey buddy, this security belongs in your portfolio as the gold portion" "

will be dumped and the remaining value placed in hot pursuit of the real thing. Just watch how it all unfolds, you will fell the pressure.

I for one hope someone can force paper gold lower while physical supplies still sell into it. Because once paper credibility is broken, our physical markets will seem like a speck of sand washed on an ocean shore.

We were at this same crossroads almost one year ago. The same stress brought about the "Washington Agreement" as it was pieced together during the summer of 99. I expect that this time, stronger medicine will be applied and fully expect it is "in process" now with gold under $280! The only difference today is that the Euro grows more mature and oil ever more independent.

Onward to camp

Here is a post I offered on our Forum. It's a good reflection of what was just said. Read it around the fire.

Journeyman (03/21/00; 06:32:00MDT - Msg ID:27201)

Paper/gold composite spot

I know we all pay lip service, but at times like this, it's good to remember. Also good to remember, if TC or MK was it? was correct, most of the gold "sold" actually travels around to other CBs, it doesn't really enter the market, doesn't affect the supply/demand equation except psychologically.
--------------------------------------------------
Journeyman,

What MK wrote about total gold in the CBs is absolutely true. I agree with him in that we read so very little about this statistic. I think it's because it obliterates most of the theories about how the CBs are killing the gold price by selling off this unneeded asset.

I and Another pointed our countless times that the CBs were mostly playing the BBs against the market by giving "gray guarantees" to protect their (the BBs) paper positions. In reality the whole thing is a political thriller every bit equal to any 007 film.

The truth of it all is that they could never control the value of physical gold and because of this kept most of their holdings in tact. I would even go so far as to say that much of their draw down is an illusion.

We must remember that selling a real asset to the public for cash does not control anything. You get the gold, they get the paper money. It's the same for crude. The price is what you get real oil for. The lower the better. Just like gold, a lower price imparts the benefit and use of the product to the buyer. Indeed, a lower price is the loss is to the seller. Through out this 1990s gold downturn, what physical gold the new buyers obtained was to their gain. There was no control at all, the buyer gained the gold!

What this modern gold market can control is the value of contract gold. Here they (BBs) do an exceptionally fine job. They sold paper gold to everyone that wanted to only bet on it's price movement, not buy gold. To this end, they took everyone's money and the buyer got nothing in return. Yes, it did play an important role in supporting the dollar while the currency world was in transition. Just as our USAGOLD writer SteveH has said, this gold industry and the contract market it services was sacrificed. But, look at what would have happened if they didn't. Indeed, the time brought was purchased on the backs of gold bugs, not physical gold advocates. One ended up with depreciating paper and the other with an ages old world class money. This isn't the first time citizens of the world such as Farfel learned that "betting" and "owning" are two different things. It won't be the last!

This country is diving head first into a grand hyper inflation and no amount of Fed maneuvers will stop it. People that learn this early on, before the physical comes into short supply, will be miles ahead. Buying gold between $400 and $200 will be like knowing a member with Masters Tickets.
------------------------------------------------------------
Enough for now, unpack and lights out. We need our rest because the trail will get rough from here on out.

Looking ahead, around the next curve?


Last year the Washington Agreement (WA) spelled the end of the modern paper gold markets as we know it. Yet, few people truly believe anything substantial has happened because gold failed to "follow through" on it's post WA price spike. Most hold this conclusion as a result of watching the ball instead of the game.

The WA was a direct response to the "dollar faction's" use of contract gold in driving the value of the "real asset" down. Prior to the Euro birth, such an extreme paper manipulation below $280 would have been meet with a different kind of WA. More likely an outright "physical purchase" of gold on the world spot markets by the BIS. They would have allocated this newly purchased gold into the same official accounts where current BIS gold flows are now placed.

But today we operate in an established, new Euro environment. The very fact that the US and England acknowledged the WA is alone evidence of this new Euro political power. In essence, an ECB / BIS alliance has placed the world "in process" to changing the way gold is traded and valued. A process that will drain "real gold" liquidity from the present london market and leave many players wondering what happened.

Part of understanding "what is happening" requires us to keep our eyes "on the game", not on the ball. Physical gold advocates have but to follow the posts of TownCrier on the USAGOLD Forum. He has consistently pointed out how "Post Euro" Euroland arena gold sales are being "allocated" into BIS sanctioned placements.

Even though the WA allowed for 2,000 tonnes to be sold over 5 years, no provisions were made to officially channel that new gold into the world contract market. The upcoming Swiss sales and the more recent Austria sales make the point. Especially when one understands that the BIS does not buy gold to sell outside the CB community or it's special accounts held for certain nations.

More importantly about the WA, the total existing contracts held at signing time were allowed to continue without any draw down criteria (gold to cover) over the 5 yr. term. Over time, this will squeeze the dollar physical market in an effort to fill existing paper commitments. In effect, the BIS now has it's hand on the gold valve and is controlling the contract filling flow at will.

But most analysis misinterpret the strategy of this. It is not an attempt to drive the contract gold prices upward. Quite the contrary, it's effects are just the opposite. In our current dollar gold market, the less gold is supplied, the more it pressures the price down! Players must create and sell not just more contracts to cover expiring ones, but also sell enough paper to force the price down further. In a market that's becoming shorter of physical gold, this is the only way they can add equity to cover rollover positions. In this political game, the dollar supporting paper gold arena is being forced to kill itself. It's also the reason I proclaim that we will see rare physical gold in the thousands once the deed is done.

Looking down the trail we can see the end of our paper gold markets. This same market place that evolved from 1971 into a "contract gold currency" is now being politically forced into hyperinflation in much the same way fiat currencies are. Just as the dollar has been inflated to unimaginable extremes to protect the US banking system, so to will this gold currency be inflated until suddenly it's credibility is shaken. I think a large gold default is directly ahead and it will be forced by the BIS / ECB. Right up until that default, contract gold currency will be printed as never before. Indeed, they are printing now for all they are worth! Literally!

If contract gold prices stop around here, be assured that the US dollar supporting faction has truly hit the end of that printing "worth"! If the prices start to rise now, a canceling of the BOE gold sales will confirm a large default in the pipeline. There would be no reason to sell into their LBMA if the marketplace is lost.

Further, watch for a sudden rush of OI on comex (double ot triple of total OI). This is the same item we watched for as confirmation around this time last year. The rush to buy contracts will be nothing more than an attempt at bookkeeping hedging by big traders. Truly no gold will come into play.

Excitement is building while the game is "in process"!

The trail is getting rough!

Here is a map to review as we walk.

I have read numerous times over the last year where analysts are finally subscribing to the fact that gold is a political tool. At first (1996 - 1997) only a handful even discussed this as a possibility, citing their perceptions that it couldn't be manipulated on such a grand scale. Now almost everyone knows it as a fact. Still, very, very few of them can today make the connection that the political tool of managing gold is not by selling on the physical side. In reality it's actually the "contract gold marketplace" itself where paper selling manages the gold marketplace.

We read media report after report where the CBs are dumping gold and forcing it's price down. But just as I pointed out on our last hike, in the BIS world of CB gold trading a very small percentage of gold has physically left their system during the 90s. The only thing falling has been both the "contract gold price" and that of investor perceptions of "total gold stocks" held officially. If investor thoughts have been manipulated at all they have been impacted most by "watching the ball and not following the game".

Onward

Clearly the world has broken itself into "only two" currency system support blocks. The US and the European! We have to observe these factions as a group if we are to understand their actions. Further, it's important to place nations that are outside these two groups. Are they "supporters" or destroyers of a faction. Which one is most strategic to their cause.

Japan and much of the Asian block are clearly "supporters" of the dollar faction because their entire trading structure was built on selling into a "US dollar trade deficit". Any buying of gold or Euros with dollar reserves would wreck their economy further by driving the Yen straight up. If they do elect to do this it will be in response to a much larger American economic crisis and occur further along in the dollar inflation timeline. Talk of the Yen being the third part of a "tripolar" currency world will be proven completely off the mark. Japan and any other of their close economic allies will sacrifice their money's viability for some time to stay with the dollar. In the process suffering the same full blown dollar hyperinflation effects that are coming to the US. Other Asian nations sold gold during their recent crisis not in support of the dollar so much as they were forced by the IMF to do so. In a story I have told before, their physical buying was hurting the manipulation game. Breaking them was all in an effort by the BIS to maintain a Pre Euro low gold agreement. Today, the lesser nations of the Asian block have returned to buying gold. Something that is in their culture, rather than a desire to destroy the dollar. Only this time we will not witness a political effort to stop this buying. To there credit and good fortune many (asians) will retain this wealth asset as our dollar is eaten from price inflation.

China is a wild card that uses the US for short term gain while not politically "supporting" the dollar system. Their historic trading ties face West to Europe, retracing the old Orient Express. Further, their attachment to gold is a natural draw that pulls them into the Euro faction. When the time is right and Euro trade deep enough, they like the oil producers will adopt the Euro as a reserve. That time may be very, very close!

Canada is seen selling it's gold stock in support of the US. This is an easy one to understand because everything they do is US related. Like Japan, if the US sinks Canada will ride the ship down. Their small gold holdings were nothing compared to standing in the American shadow. Selling it helped keep liquid our contract market. Still, I think most of their sales ended up in BIS and CB accounts anyway. Indeed, North American gold that will eventually support the Euro. The irony of it all!

South America has been in an extended financial crisis for what seems like forever. For the moment they also have tied their economic fortunes to the dollar and sold much of their gold in it's support. Yet, tragically this whole continent continues to operate as an economic "play thing" that is used by whatever world "currency block" that's in power. They will be dropped off by the dollar train and picked up by the Euro train at the next "crisis station". But because of the gold ties that Euroland will employ, South America as a whole will eventually prosper as they are forced to painfully break from the dollar induced inflation cycles of the past 20+ years. In time the Euro will be good for them.

England was not only part of the dollar faction, it was the dollar faction and is clearly becoming a "run a way" nation. They are moving towards the Euro and leaving our dollar world. But, unlike many other first tier Euroland nations that joined and quietly sold gold into private accounts, Britain is selling it's gold in an obvious "retreating action" from the dollar. Truly, their government has a long history with the "who's who" in LBMA and I suspect owes more than a few favors. Their little gold sales are specifically designed to allow some "backing out" room before the dollar based contract gold markets fail. Once in the Euro, England will enjoy the shelter of a free gold market that supports the Euro system. Still, after saying this, I would not be surprised to find that a good portion of those bullion bars ended up filling contracts owed to BIS accounts.

Editor's note: It's amazing to recall just how few knowledgeable people even had even heard of the LBMA prior to 1996, let alone know how it impacted the gold markets for years prior. I remember reading how many "big time" internet gold writers were asking "what's the LBMA" when it first made public it's trading volumes. These same "political gold analysis" today know "all about it". It's all part of the learning process we "physical gold advocates" are gaining by as their cheap physical gold is sold for the wrong reasons (smile).

A view of the Mountain

The game we should be watching (instead of the ball), has been changing from the spring of 1999. The early joint manipulations of contract gold has broken apart and left only the US standing alone in the wind. As I said further back on the trail, the US dollar faction is now hyper inflating contract gold in a last ditch effort to block a dollar destroying rise in "physical prices". Many people (Cavan Man, USAGOLD poster?) do not understand why the Euro/BIS group just stands there and allow this to happen. The fact is that they (Euroland) have the gold in the BIS system (never really sold it outside) and do not care what happens to the prices of contract gold expressed by the US or LBMA marketplace. Those contracts (as the gold currency they represent) (SDRs?) will eventually fail.

This is a simple concept that so confounds and hurts investors and traders in the "gold industry" today. They are mostly on the "failing" side of the war as their purpose remains to bet too large an amount of their hard portfolio on the price movement of contract gold, not own physical gold itself! I would say that the opinions expressed on most of the internet come from traders trying to time a paper trade in a failing marketplace. Even those buying gold mines can be compared to my "Paper deeds for Roman Gold" analogy. Betting on a rise in the price of real estate then selling it for Roman gold coins before the city (gold marketplace) falls.

"Truly, the ECB / BIS have made sure that there will not be enough Roman Gold to cover the property sales before the city falls"! Physical gold will not follow the same ratio to mine equity it did in the 70s. If a mine goes from $10 to $300, bullion will have gone from $300 to $15,000++.

The contract marketplace for gold has for years given the illusion to Western investors that enough gold exists to maintain the old ratios. So they continue to follow this mistaken precedent and follow their chart points. Points that can only represent the trading realities of paper. All the while planing their move that will make them some retirement money. Sadly however, once the paper gold system is broken, we will all experience an evolution in the true value of physical gold as it is expressed against mine equity, currencies, all real things and most certainly paper gold equity. Something this dollar world of investors have never seen before.

Just as Koan (a USAGOLD poster) long ago expressed bewilderment at how gold moved as fast or faster than silver and most gold stocks after the WA, the coming true break in the system will make that even percentage comparison to paper look like nothing at all. Investors that do not believe this should rejoice for the experience, it will be a chance to see something few ever get to see (smile).

Honestly, during most of our investing "timeline", we as Westerners have never understood that owning gold itself "IS" the profit one makes when a reserve currency system fails! The price of physical gold in said failing currency is "meaningless" because that price can no longer express any long term value!

Back to the main trail (extending from my first paragraph)

They (paper gold bugs) "now" rightly warn everyone that this "political control" of gold is coming to a dangerous end and council investors to "be in" the gold markets for this ride. But most "gold bug traders" stick to "the paper facts" and maintain strict "paper trading" discipline. I submit they will completely miss the "real profit" of owning gold at an advantageous currency price. Their trading with factual information about this "paper marketplace" will eventually net them only more paper gold or currency in a cash settlement. Both of which values will fall completely behind a soaring physical market.

By sticking to the "facts" dictated to them from trading in a hyper inflated paper contract market, they cannot see the "reality" of a coming "politically induced" shortage of deliverable gold. Just because a contract is governed by the Crown's laws, doesn't mean it will retain the value of physical settlement. As the dollar holders prior to 1971 thought they held a receipt for warehouse gold, the dollar's gold market today will leave traders completely out of the greatest gold bull ever to occur! This my friends is understanding the politics of gold in it's fullest context.

The great dollar hyper inflation is only just beginning. Convulsions in all paper markets will be the norm from here on out.

Next item today: a response to the points of Aristotle and TownCrier (USAGOLD posters)

Hello Aristotle,

Your message #ID:28580 was very interesting.

Aristotle (04/13/00; 21:31:56MDT - Msg ID:28580)
Question for Trail Guide
Do you what means of price discovery is employed for the Gold transactions conducted through the BIS? I know the BIS as part of their regular fuctions faciltates transfers of Gold on behalf of their account holders, and I would assume that the conditions of the various transfers might (might not?) make them different from what we saw with the latest mobilization by the Ductch CB through the BIS. If the Dutch, and now Austrian, (and likely Swiss) Gold mobilizations are a unique form of operation, is there an element of price discovery for each independent Gold mobilization? I'm also currious about the transparency of the "going price" for real metal through these official channels.

As I reflect on the Dutch operation, I recall that the ECB's weekly balance sheet simply revealed the value of the mobilized Gold as the product of the current official ECB Gold book value (marked to market each quarter, as we all know) and the tonnage placed through the BIS. In the event that this Dutch Gold was involved in what could be deemed a true "sale," the reason I question the validity of assuming the officail ECB price to be the sale price is related to what the IMF has done recently. For the benefit of those following along, but not familiar with the recent IMF Gold "sales," after selling IMF Gold at prevailing market value to member nations and then accepting it back in settlement of their debts, the IMF continues to carry the Gold on their own books at their official value of 35 Special Drawing Rights, while the "excess currency value" gets funnelled into an investment account--reportedly held by the BIS. I'm simply wondering if there is "excess value" generated in these Dutch/BIS style operations that aren't reflected in the existing level of transparency--that being the valuations only revealed through the fixed ECB statements.

Ultimately, I guess I'm not overly concerned with the mechanics themselves. What I find myself to be most intrigued by is the possibility/potential of additional transparency in these BIS-facilitated operations that might reveal a pricing disconnect with the London and New York markets. Or would that constitute an unacceptible rocking of the boat, in which case they (BIS faction) will bide their time behind the veil of the ECB official price until the LBMA and New York will have crashed themselves through the discredit of non-delivery?

Have really enjoyed your commentary. Sorry I haven't had more time to engage you in discussion.

Getting back to the IMF before I sign off for the moment, it looks like they are at least structurally postioned to function in accord with my proposed "perfect monetary system" regarding the role of Gold as a non-lendable/non-inflatable asset. From their recently updated website--though admittedly there is nothing NEW here:

"According to Article V, Section 12 (b) of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, any transactions in gold by the IMF require an 85 percent majority of the total voting power in the IMF. The IMF may sell gold outright on the basis of prevailing market prices; it may accept gold in the discharge of a member's obligations to the IMF at an agreed price on the basis of prices in the market at the time of acceptance. The IMF does not have the authority to engage in any other gold transactions, e.g., loans, leases, swaps, or use of gold as collateral, and the IMF does not have the authority to buy gold."

Gold. It's not just for barbarians anymore. ---Aristotle

It seems that some have walked this trail before me as my "Guiding" is following the echo of USAGOLD posters (smile). The fresh air must be doing everyone some good!

This day in time is a unique period in real money history. Seldom, if ever, has the world found itself in the grips of a possible, complete fiat reserve breakdown! Especially one that impacts the way 70% (???) of the worlds current assets are valued. What a wonderful mess for a well connected financial sleuth to be born into, right? (big smile)!

We will all look back on this and see that most of our trusted measuring sticks were useless to decipher the situation. If we truly do not know what a "dollar credit" (DC) is, how can we know what it is worth in purchasing power? We do not even know approximately how many DCs are out there, let alone their demand to satisfy debt service. What is really starting to spook the big world players is that no one now knows what kind of currency intervention is in the pipeline at any moment in time. This is having the effect of making one's real debt in international dollars an "unknown". The same thing goes for dollar assets?

You could owe one million in value today, then find that an evolving political agenda has changed that amount to 5 million in real value tomorrow. All of this was glossed over for many years by employing derivatives to hedge. Now that arena has grown so large that there is a real threat that the derivatives need hedging too! I laugh about it but it's a real event, happening in real time. It's scaring the hell out of a bunch of people and they are not taking if as being funny.


The camp fire is burning now and everyone is here:


Did you ever see the movie "Havana" with Robert Redford? It was a great tale about a card gambler that often went to the casinos in Cuba. It takes place just before the revolution when Havana was a real swinging place. I don't remember the exact lines in the show but he often made reference the the laws of probability. Saying "anything is possible, just not always probable". To that end he explained to his girlfriend why there was a lump in the skin in his forearm. It seems he had a diamond sewed under the skin, "just in case"!


It was an excellent example of human interaction with the laws of probability. It seems that inside all of us lies a fear that what the world is telling us (the marketplace) may not be real. Just like ORO said what if "there is no spoon" and our financial process is the trading of illusions! We all expect life itself to be chancy, and fully expect to lose some in the effort. But no one wants to be "busted out" because of a freak, once in a generation "revolution in the way wealth is counted".

In reality,,,, in the real world,,,, big players never tell their whole tale,,,, not like the persona of our little trader/gamblers talking their book on the Internet. In the big arena that really counts,,,,,, real players all keep most of the wealth "off the table" and "under the skin". So what does this have to do with the BIS?


Remembering back:


Something that Big Trader or Another said a long time ago about trading gold off market in the thousands. Trust me, it's there somewhere way back in the pre USAGOLD days. It seems that gold was then and is today traded between countries, CBs, special accounts,,,,,,, at not only contract prices but in the "perceived prices" that would exist in a non dollar world. Hard to believe? Don't be so quick to laugh. We are talking about gold traded in large amounts on the "possibility" of a no dollar reserve world,,,,,, gold moved from "under the skin" to "under the skin" so to speak.

In some cases more than a few people have "done the math" and come up with some startling probabilities and possibilities. In some perceptions, it's a political certainty!

Imagine, if you will that gold,,,,, tomorrow,,,,,, was "marked to the market" and slated for 30 day physical settlement. Most Western thinkers and investors would say that there is plenty of gold out there to cover all that paper. At worst it's price would go to,,,,, say,,,,, $700 in the squeeze. Well, that is assuming this event happens in a world like today where the dollar and our US economy is still running.

But these Western investors don't understand the real human world. Gold being marked to market would be the result of an economic revolution of sorts. A currency transition, if you will.

Most of the big talkers you here in the bar,,,,,, saying they would sell at $1,000 and buy some land,,,,,,, would be the very last scared kittens to cut that diamond from under their skin! Believe it!

Under the circumstances,,,,,,, miners would do their best to "stop mining",,,,,,, dealers would mostly be making a market on the buy side only,,,,,,, and our bar room paper gold trading friend,,, with all his bravado would be telling everyone,,,,,, "Gee, I sold too early and wish I hadn't"!! All the while wearing a long sleeve shirt on a 90 degree night in Phoenix,,,,, just to cover the lump that's under his skin!

The night is getting very still:

Today, gold is worth far more than it's traded contract price,,,, and has been for some years. That's the reason some players have owned it while giving up any interest and stock gains they could have enjoyed.

Listen to this and listen closely: "the real value of gold today is based squarely on the probability of weather the US dollar can survive as a reserve currency"! No problem, you say? Well, you may think a little different in a few weeks or years.

Considering the trade deficit of the US, CB dollar reserves and the interest they earn,,,, are worth between $.50 and $0 in real good buying power.

Now, would you sell your gold into the BIS system for dollars,,,,,, at the market price today to have it returned in Euro gold credits reserves at the real price much later?
Just as TownCrier says in his daily commentary:

the IMF gold leaves at one price and returns at "Another" ,,,,,,,, it travels far but never moves,,,,, while the BIS holds the value for a later use in time.

It seems a neet "gray concept" to have just popped out of nowhere, no? Was that plan already "in process" somewhere ,,,,,, someplace,,,,,,,, think about it?

Then think about the dollar price of gold today? In fact, "think long and hard about it"?

Fires out

Thanks for hiking. (be on the forum later or tomorrow)

Elwood,

Hello again. As you might guess there is a lot of private discussion in process now. I just stopped in to say I can't talk much right now. I think Alan just walked away from it all. In effect saying "let it go"! Ah Yes, anyone of size could own the paper gold world now and I think it will be too tempting for some operator not to try. Yet, he will only own a large paper bet for a few days.

I had offered a point earlier that our guys (US) were running out of "worth" to control gold. I think they are truly out of this "political worth" now. This could become a firestorm in a short time?

Elwood, I still have an old posted question from you about the Euro being not big enough yet to settle world oil (and other questions). It's just about there. I'll get back to that.

Also, Cavan Man offered the Goldensextant's latest views. It better puts into perspective how the BIS shuffles gold around. In a deeper thought, they actually control a lot more gold than we think.

Ok, I'm off to the bunker (smile). Watch your "top knot out there"!

After a long day and night of market thinking (for me anyway), just thought I would toss this quick one in here. Cavan Man's post gave me the thought (smile)
--------------------------------------------

If today I can purchase about $1.00 with my one CHEESEBURGER, and use this currency to purchase about 1/280 OUNCE OF GOLD, then after CHEESEBURGERS run (from price
inflation), and my CHEESEBURGER now purchases $75.00, how many OUNCES OF GOLD will I now be able to purchase?

ANSWER: About 75/15,000 of an ounce! ( big smile)


My real point:

From around 1929 to date, Americans have never known a real, full blown, all out "price hyper inflation". We have only history books and movies to give us the true mental and
physical picture of what it would be like. Yet, even these cannot begin to portray the real human interaction "up front and personal" the way it happens in real life.

To date most of us still think of things in dollar values. After a real inflation begins this all changes. But in the same way a traveler adjusts his currency values when shopping in a foreign land, so too will you quickly learn to think of things in real terms instead of dollar terms. A hundred dollar cheeseburger will be a normal as a 50,000 peso "whatever" in Inflation Land. The same attitude
will prevail in gold.

Thanks ALL for reading, but much more thanks for thinking for yourselves

Trader Gold

We are seeing more and more disappointment from the "Trader Gold" crowd. Their motives and reasoning is commented on widely by the media and spread over the internet. Often studied as the way a "Gold Bug " thinks, recently the Western investor world sees these examples as a reason to
stay away from gold not buy into it. For years this group was mixed in with all the other "gold bugs" and was considered "one - in - the - same". They are not and only now is the difference becoming more clear.

The distinction between gold stocks, contract gold and physical gold investments is widening as the relative "soundness" of these asset classes is further exposed daily. In the past, as long as all gold vehicle valuations held within a tradable ratio of each other "Trader Gold Bugs" could hide within the "Gold Bug" community and proclaim all the fine attributes of a "physical gold advocate". But
this current protracted political involvement in the gold "paper marketplace" is dividing "Gold Bugs" into their two clear different groups and showing their two clearly different reasons to be in gold.

Over the last three years, Trader Gold Bugs (TGBs) have fallen further and further behind "Physical Gold Advocates" (PGAs) as their leveraged investments are more percentage impacted by a falling contract gold system. No longer able to keep quiet, the pain that their leverage brought them is
forcing an ever more vocal (and irrational) response to the movements in gold prices.

Every $2 drop is seen as a total failure of gold and every $2 rise as pathetic and proving how gold is done in for the count. Truly, these are the perceptions of investors trading either a "Paper Gold Market Place" or a leveraged "Gold Industry". Not the feelings of a Physical Gold Advocate holding a sound world class financial asset! One that's holding it's own strongly in the face of massive
official manipulation.

The TGB crowd is hopping that more of their same kind will soon exit the stock markets and put money in "their kind" of paper assets. All the while ignoring the logic this dictates as it invites the same "hot Money" trading using the same "leverage" that is now failing Trader Bugs. If indeed
contract gold rises $10, $30 or $80 and pulls in some of the stock crowd, that same "fast mentality" will surely run away at the first sign of more official paper gold creation. Further damaging the publics view of Real Gold".

Indeed, the TBG experience is today sinking from it's own exposure to public view. A strategy that takes a 1970s gold precedent and continues to extrapolate it into our future. Yet it is failing from an evolving gold arena. Our gold success for tomorrow will rest on a new and different dynamic not the aging leveraged games of years past.

The precedent for the future of gold is found much further in the past than the 70s. It is a return to natural human economic reasoning of what wealth always has been and is now. This thinking is being helped on by a changing official recognition of what gold should do and be as an asset class
in official and public hands. Taken from a time when Freegold ruled the wealth world, physical gold will tomorrow be the investment of our future from today.

The old TGB experience will go the way of past fads of the investing world as a modern, smart, new investor steps from the fog of all paper leverage failures. Not just leverage gold failures! To their credit new generations do understand when an old investment strategy is little more than the
"old baggage" of their fathers. The event that marks the end of carrying this dollar luggage is an ending currency timeline that is directly ahead. Clean, non leveraged new money is getting ready for it today with physical gold.

Looking ever forward we are today joining a new dynamic force in the world. Physical Gold Advocates are now using sound, responsible reasoning while building a rock solid alliance with the economic builders of tomorrow. The future holds that Physical Gold will not be savings. Nor will not be a hedge. It will not even be an investment.

For those with the courage to follow in the "Footsteps of Giants", gold will be the opportunity of a lifetime!

Thank you

I hope you have some success because those damn things are hard to ride. For this American anyway! (smile)

You are right, we do seem to be more free with our military these days. It just feels like we are slipping into the same old "pre inflation" society values that are responsible for "war attitudes" in the past. Our Economic engine pulls all of us into it's high speed printing press whirl and we end up demanding the head of any peoples (or nation) that slows it down. I see moral values at the very edge of the same old "I demand mine now" and "to hell with the outcome" thinking. It more profitable to trade it than own it! Didn't Robert Precter detail some of this in his last book?

Anyway, good luck when your first ride comes!(smile)

Hello Trail Guide
Is Trail Guide/FOA more than one person?

Hello Cavan Man,

No, I'm the two of them. Because FOA interprets, transcribes and publicly represents the thoughts of another poster, I found myself unable to express (and defend) my own position when attacked or challenged. It's a cultural gulf that's different from what we know in a lot of Western social
interaction. Here I post as Trail Guide so as to still tie my personal feelings to those presented on the Gold Trail, but write as I see fit.

Another seldom writes "outright". Most of his Thoughts (I'd say more than 3/4) are transcribed. He's a long term thinker / planer / leader and has every intent on seeing this "new gold market" through to the end. Many people think his whole presentation is winding down because he has withdrawn for a while. I can assure you the last few years were only an "outcry" of what is to come. When events lead the way, FOA will fade to the background as Another's Thoughts again
take the stage. At least this time, I'll be able to continue posting here as Trail Guide (smile).

The satisfaction of drawing together a school of independent THINKERS is also sublime beyond most human accomplishments.

-------------------------

Hello Mr. Gresham,

Thanks for your consideration and the same to everyone else who has voiced the same. It's taken a while for me to read all the posts. I know there are more than a few that hold OldGold's position. But, their position and strategy speaks for itself. It will succeed or fail them in the long run. I think if Another were here today he would say "time will prove all things" and leave with that simple, all
consuming thought.

Yet, I can't help but think that your comment about "drawing together thinkers" is indeed part of the plan we see in process here today. While GATA leads with a nuts and bolts attract, Another draws the human spirit and imparts his question in the hearts of real wealth patriots.

I have read that education through experience builds the mind. Once shown what to look for, events become the real experience that creates lasting knowledge and demands the search for more. More often than not wars are won by an army lead from the last in line. Yet only armed with a truth they have found on their own.

"we watch this new gold market together, yes"

Suppose for a moment you were a Central Bank......
....Would you "sell" your hard assets (gold) for another commodity that you could easily create out of thin air (U.S. Dollars) ? This has probably been mentioned by others, but where is all of this gold being "sold" by the Central Banks ? Is it entering the (private) markets as physical, or is it simply more of the illusion, actually consisting of nothing more than bookkeeping entries from one CB to another ? The "numbers" don't seem to add up for some strange reason.

Oldgold stirring the pot
Oldgold, thanks for stirring our little pot of soup. Some stuff has gottent stuck at the bottom.

Rather that try to put Trail Guide's point across for him, which he does very well himself, I will just point out this:

1. There has been a gold standard in effect through the 80s.
The US overdrew its gold and the system collapsed.

2. There has been a dual physical gold and paper gold standard since 1989 or so. The US and UK overdrew this by 1997.

3. The Asian collapse, though it would have happened eventually anyway, was a planned event that saved our sorry @$$es for three years.

4. The bulk of the dollar support mechanism (remember that we did not have a current account surplus in three decades) was a series of debt traps for various emerging nations that were indebted by tricks and by force. These debtors needed dollars to pay off interest on dollar loans so that they could buy life's basics on the global markets.

5. The idea of a debt derived money offering stability in economic function and in prices is an absurdity on the scale of defying gravity, absolving the world from Newton's law. Without an anchor in a commodity money, all debt money spirals out of control and into worthlessness. No conceivable system can make it otherwise. Gold is to finance and money as the speed of light is to Einstein's law of relativity. Gold answers the question "relative to what?".

In short: for a monetary system to work, someone, somewhere, must be able to exchange the currency for gold AT A FIXED RATE. We call this parity.

6. The global dollar debt system is collapsing. Soon, only the US and a few "friends" will be left owing dollars and owning the "bag" - our debt.

7. The system could not work if it was well known even among the top bankers, because their attempts to get into gold for defense against this would have killed the system. Even now, when it is apparent, bankers refuse to believe that their product is as toxic as RJR's and Columbia's main export combined (and they work in remarkably simillar ways).

Finally, say thanks for the low gold and silver prices you are getting and pray that it can continue. Next thanksgiving tell your familly to give thanks to the Germans, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Indians, Italians and others who feed and clothe us half the time (actually 56% in 1998, 60% in 1999).
---------------------------------------
Some details and discussion follow:

We have fought a war and have lost it. The war that was fought was for financial hegemony through the issue of the reserve currency for the world. In essence making the US serve the role of banker to the world. The war was lost in 1968 and defeat conceded in 1971 and again in 1973. With much support from a world scared of a complete freeze-up of commerce, the dollar was resuscitated just in the nick of time and a new gold convertibility standard was put together by the same bankers that pushed for and got the Fed and then Bretton Woods. JP Morgan said "gold is the only money". He said so well into the Fed's life when gold was no longer circulating in great volumes.

Fiat debt money is incapable of maintaining value without a fix to a real item - notably the precious metals, and the most prominent of them, gold. The dollar is two different things at the same time. Within the US is only a product of debt, the IOUs of all us credit card using and mortgage and car loan paying people that the bank sells to the producers of the houses, goods, autos we buy with "credit". Outside the US, the dollar is much the same, until it meets the BIS for transnational settlements of imbalances. There, the central banks trade gold for dollars at an unknown exchange rate much greater than that in the markets. (This is a premium that is payed for the right to buy gold rather than the gold itself - this way it is kept off the books). The private markets provide the non-US private bankers an opportunity to hedge their dollar assets and those of their clients. The US banks and their UK allies produce the paper gold needed for settlements of dollars into gold debt.

The fact that someone - somewhere - can settle over $100 billion dollars in unbalance "imbalance of payments" every year with gold, is what makes the dollar's value relatively stable.

The US and UK bankers had completely overstepped their bounds in the process and issued way more paper gold than there could ever be redeemed (the BIS and OCC statistics just deal with derivative contracts, these are just mirrors of a much larger gold banking system which underlies trade and at which gold settles the dollar through the SDR). So long as the gold credits were believed to be redeemable, the system was credible.

When it lost credibility, in 1996 - 1997, the imperative became the classic wildcat bank strategy of moving the gold in the back door when the inspector comes to look at your reserves, and transfering it to the next bank just as the inspector is on his way there. The whole dynamic is now the satisfaction of gold demand by whatever means necessary so as to maintain credibility of the paper and thus prevent a "bank run". The Washington Agreement was the statement by the EU that they will not put in jeopardy any more of their gold, that their part in the dollar support system is over. Since that date, the US has been exporting some 800 tons of gold (annual rate) officially, and an unknown ammount "below custom's radar".

In the meantime, the bankers in the EU and the UK have been redeeming their gold liabilities to their clients with American gold liabilities. When actual gold ran out and gold yet to be mined (or found or explored for) was used for settlement, some time in the late 80s, this part of the dollar support system was born. The part US banks played was (at first) small, US market share in gold banking was some 20% in 1995. By 1997, it passed 35%, by mid 99- over 42%, now it probably passed the 50% mark according to OCC numbers (BIS numbers for the end of 99 will only come out in June).

This process reflects the change of responsibility for managing the dollar from the losers of WWII to the "winner". The Fed is responsible for the viability of the liabilities of US banks. These liabilities are what we call dollars if banks can't supply dollars they owe, the Fed supplies them through the treasury and directly. The gold liabilities of US banks are quickly growing so that they will soon hold all of the dollar side of the global dollar-gold settlement system. When the transfer of gold liability from the UK to the US is complete, there will no longer be any reason for Europe and the Oil nations, nor China to assist in controling the gold ecxhange rate. At that point, the gold obligations will be terminated and gold contracts and accounts drawn on US banks will be settled in dollars only.
The time for that is not here yet. I would venture a guess at the time frame of the end of this year. At current rates, the transfer should be finished by then.

The terms for the end of the game were set, in part, in the early 80s. Since then, there had been a tremendous effort by the US government to stop use of American resources by American and foreign consumers. Major finds of gas, and particularly, oil were capped and not allowed to go into production. Forest lands were set aside from loggers. Gold mines were induced not to explore nor produce gold within the US. Why? So that when the end does come, the US will have cash traded commodities to sell - so that when the US can't buy on dollar credit anymore, it will have something to trade while the country is reindustrialized.

The US tried to play the technology card by assisting US tech companies in gaining investments, that was done by making them appear more attractive to investors through SEC and IRS accounting rules regarding ESOPs and merger accounting that lower the cash costs of top talent and make losses seem like earnings. But the "social adjustment" oriented school system produces mostly good salespeople and hamburger flippers. India has more programmers than Silicon Valley, and Taiwan and Singapore produce more chips. The best computer and software design is done in Ireland and the Norse countries, and wireless technology is mostly a Finnish, British and German industry. The only way to eliminate the disadvatage in education is to import as many tech pros as we can before they stop wanting to come here. If 10 million 30-35 year old techies can be imported over the next 5-10 years, the US may have a chance to survive as the major economy.

The bank debt reports published by the BIS and the IMF tell the story in all of its gorey statistical details. The dollar debt outside the US is collapsing as it is turned from emerging market and transnational corporate debt into American debt. The US imports produce a flood of dollars that pay off the liabilities of Emerging nation's corporations, governments and banks. It is the need by these to repay dollar loans that has produced demand for dollars abroad. Now that they no longer borrow in quantity and have been reducing their debt, these countries are slowly reducing the international value of the dollar and adding themselves to the long list of dollar creditors. The only dollar debtors left are the UK, some HIPCs, and the greatest debtor ever, the US.

The story is simple. The debt trap set for the emerging markets by 3% dollar interest rates in the early nineties, was sprung in 1997 by a joint effort of the Fed, the IMF and the BIS. The IMF demanded self destructive policies from the countries it was supposed to help, the BIS raised their bank's reserve requirements (actually it was their net asset ratios - a.k.a. ccapital adequacy - but few understand what that is and reserves are a close enough descriptor), and the Fed raised interest rates by all of 1/4% and the whole Asian economic system collapsed.

This generated the requisite dollar demand, stopped Asian gold demand, produced an Asian gold supply, and allowed EU and US banks to buy out many Asian corporation's assets that they were barred from owning before. Hyena and Vulture LP had their day. We were spared disaster for another three years.

Good Morning everyone!


Because the group has had a good night's sleep and a fresh cup of coffee, I wanted to say a few things to fresh minds before we get started.

People hike the gold trail for the understanding they gain along the way. For some it's to make a profit using the reasoning gained. Others find reinforcement about the historical asset insurance gold provides against other wealth. Still others do it to further an ideological standpoint that gold wealth is more a direct reflection of true reality in life. Whatever the reason, for many people gold holds and maintains a real image of stability even beyond it's currency price. A rare concept in this modern world full of financial fakery.

Whatever your purpose in joining us may be, understand that neither I or us make the trail. We simply follow it as it winds it's way through our evolving lives. Gold, an entity of mother earth's making has a fluid value that's an ever changing perception of what wealth represents in the minds of men and women. Over time the wants and dreams of humanity along with their need to retain them are the forces that shape this path. The actions of ourselves and the governments that represent us create this trail as we grasp just how much in life is real and how much is not.

To date, we see a large segment of Western society that has accepted most of our modern paper as their wealth and reasoned that the value of gold itself is little more than an illusion today. In time most of these "new reality" believers will join us here and contrast their life's experiences with other hikers. In these recounts, many will profess that they lost "what they never really owned"!

Observations

A few days ago I offered this post: Trail Guide (4/18/2000; 7:00:01MDT - Msg ID:28918). It can be found on your laptops in the USAGOLD archives.

I presented a perception of the changing image of Gold Bugs as they appear to other would be gold investors. Many of whom see the strategy of the old TGBs (trader gold bugs) as something to avoid as it produces nothing but loses. A wealth destruction that seems unending as the evolution of the gold market itself continues. This evolution of over twenty years has proven to many that our market place was never as free as many played it for. Indeed, the growing perception today is that the gold industry and this paper market place have become little more than a leveraged game inside a manipulated concept. Rather than a contract market that represents the sum total of knowledge and therefore value of our physical gold supply. In the beginning this concept once held gold trading to be the same as free physical trading. It never was then and is not today.

New, "would be" physical gold investors are not looking at the gains made from shorting or going long paper gold as profits made from operating in the same arena that dealers use to sell physical from. Rather profits and loses from trading all paper representations of gold are seen only as they apply to our current paper market. While profits and loses from owning physical gold are found only in the physical market. To date the profit and loss difference between these mediums is striking. In the face of massive distortion of facts, figures and contract supply, physical gold has suffered a very reasonable discount when compared to investments in it's leveraged paper side.

Seeing this, the question is presented: why trade a gold industry security or gold derivative paper when I can make and lose just as much playing the established fiat stock markets? Truly, if contract paper gold is being inflated with supply in order to mask bullish fundamentals on the physical side, why bet on a rise in physical gold using a leveraged derivative? If the world stock markets are in trouble and I need to hedge my wealth, why hedge using an arena that will tend to be manipulated down even more so as equity markets fail?

Further, if this official paper gold market is not the free place we thought it was why not buy the product that's in short supply and the subject of said paper manipulation? In this regard, Physical Gold Advocates are gaining the upper ground of "sound reasoning" as we speak! New investors see through the fog and don't want any part of an investment that's already killing many investor assets. From my post:
--------
"The distinction between gold stocks, contract gold and physical gold investments is widening as the relative "soundness" of these asset classes is further exposed daily. In the past, as long as all gold vehicle valuations held within a tradable ratio of each other "Trader Gold Bugs" could hide within the "Gold Bug" community and proclaim all the fine attributes of a "physical gold advocate". But this current protracted political involvement in the gold "paper marketplace" is dividing "Gold Bugs" into their two clear different groups and showing their two clearly different reasons to be in gold.

Over the last three years, Trader Gold Bugs (TGBs) have fallen further and further behind "Physical Gold Advocates" (PGAs) as their leveraged investments are more percentage impacted by a falling contract gold system. No longer able to keep quiet, the pain that their leverage brought them is forcing an ever more vocal (and irrational) response to the movements in gold prices.

Every $2 drop is seen as a total failure of gold and every $2 rise as pathetic and proving how gold is done in for the count. Truly, these are the perceptions of investors trading either a "Paper Gold Market Place" or a leveraged "Gold Industry". Not the feelings of a Physical Gold Advocate holding a sound world class financial asset! One that's holding it's own strongly in the face of massive official manipulation." " "
----------------------
This full post was aimed squarely at the failed paper gold investor of the past. Whether buying into the gold industry or the contract gold arena, the flaw in this strategy is that leverage gold today is and has been for some time opposed to official policy. An investor can "wait out" this policy time frame or buy directly into the part of the gold market that cannot be controlled. Physical gold!

The real leverage today is found in the understanding of just how this current "wind down" of official policy will impact the two markets for gold.

Whether doing the bidding of "official policy" or just trading paper gold short, the major makers of short contracts cannot and will not "just walk way". If they have created so much supply that it is "uncoverable", they have no option in stopping their writing. In a last ditch effort they may make every trader aware that they will create a bottomless pit of supply if necessary to stop any rise in contract prices. Regardless of the physical price! Especially if a rise in contract prices is the only accepted agent they must mark their margin to! In the end, no speculator, commercial trader or gambler in the world will buy into a contract that must end outside physical settlement. The end of out current gold markets may end this way:

"""""""""" If physical gold spikes and is trading in the dealer market for $3,000 an ounce,,,,,, and a major trader stands ready to sell contracts in any number,,,,, to all comers,,,,, for $200,,,,, no one will buy if the obvious settlement will be for the full equity of the paper gold marketplace!!!! Truly an amount that may only bring $400 or less (an ounce) in negotiated cash to cover the "end time" hyper inflated contracts issued. """"""

This my friends is the full picture seen by not just old money in gold but new gold money also! It's also the reason so much "Physical Gold" is leaving the US today. Please see Mr.TownCrier (4/19/2000; 17:59:41MDT - Msg ID:29050).

Western gold investors have lost the real "Gold Spirit" rooted deeply in their past as they chase profits instead of reality. Mr. Farfel made this comment (Msg ID:28931) that so aptly describes this modern Western phenomenon:

" " You seem to have the mentality of a trader, with no rooted beliefs in anything other than that which makes you profit." "

Onward The Trail:

The gold industry today is in a position to take advantage of and profit from this changing view of gold. To do this they must sell their product to the public, not their shares. Microsoft did not get where it is today by selling it's stock as an alternative to owning Windows. It sold it's main product first to a public that wanted and needed it. It's stock value followed.

Two thirds of the modern gold market creators have walked away from further manipulating the current pricing system. The ECB / BIS position has evolved into letting the remaining market inflate itself into oblivion. If the gold industry is to survive this coming reckoning of a crashing system, they must move now to break their product away from filling paper commitments. Only a small handful will have this choice. The move by some players in creating "goldavenue.com" is a major first step. But it's not enough.

The companies that will survive must make their product into registered form. Then sell only to users that will certify and prove that gold's end use as jewelry, coin or private bar. Registered bar sales, must be stored in bonded warehouses that can identify a mine's product bar. If the paper industry or fabrication process is to use this gold they must remelt it, absorb the cost and pay a fee to the mine of that numbered the bar.

Very few mines will make this shift. But it's the only way they will profit enough to overcome the taxes and regulation that's coming.

The gold industry must make every effort to educate investors that their mine shares are not a substitute for owning gold. Demonstrate why persons should own and utilize their software (gold) for personal financial safety first. Only later (as profit potential prescribes) encourage persons to invest in microsoft stock (gold shares).

The few companies that can follow this lead today will be amazed at the outcome tomorrow!

Further:

The paper markets give the illusion of a fat gold supply that says, "there's plenty to go around". Yet, once our paper markets finally price in their own destructive tendency, the illusion of supply will vanish along with the available product. The price change in physical gold will be fast and brutal, to say the least. Leaving virtually no chance to convert any paper profits into real gold on a one to one basis.

To this end, "PGAs" (Physical Gold Advocates) today enjoy the very best of all worlds.

The "wind down" of our official paper marketplace has begun with the Washington Agreement. An accord that began with the first private acknowledgment that IMF gold would have to be revalued through either sale or official revaluation. We are on the road to very high priced gold, but will not arrive "publicly" at these values until the paper markets destroy themselves.

London is clearly in the wind down process as their volume slows. The dollar faction is alone in representing itself as the defender of low paper gold prices. I give the odds of contract gold spiking and holding it's gains at one in ten. If the paper gold market can end it's days in a rapid rise to bankruptcy, it will take a major portion of the banking system with it. The same banks that the mines must work through today.

In the eyes of new Gold Bugs, all risk today is in paper held in lieu of gold. The choice is clear. Buy into a bear market in paper or ride on a new concept for our changing modern world.

The future belongs to the PGA. Physical Gold Advocate!

Trail Guide EURO
Hello. I am looking at analysus that focuses on possibility that Euro's downtrend portends value crises of this currency. It seems that all the prognostications of the dollars future are what is exactly happened to the Euro. Since its inception it has steadily lost value, and now appears at the crossroads to go down more.

This it semms is the only major currency arena where the price of gold is in a bullish uptrend. In a world already saturated with debt financed stuff, it seems any fundamental competative advantage of lower Euro, will still net out very negatively against increased costs for oil,electricity,etc., in Euroland.
-------------------------------

Hello Hi - Hat!

Good question. I'll offer in my words what was presented to me from some other people.

--------
Every time the Euro comes up in conversation someone points out the ever so obvious fact that it has fallen against the dollar. Ok, so what does this do to impact us as world players?

First: my new Euro accounts are static in Euroland and are spent there for investments if and when need be. As a international player I don't trade my dollar accounts (local US held) against these or other holding in foreign domains. To date, my real cost of acquisition in Euroland has little or no effect from the Euro / Dollar exchange rate. A myriad of other factors come into play when determining a particular investment's (Euroland) viability. Unless the industry is exposed as an importer from dollar nations the short term exchange rate means nothing. If our selected sector is export related and sells into a dollar sector, then all the better for them. Our long term success rests on the sector's ability to make an adequate return in Euros. The whole purpose is to build an asset infrastructure that will remain in the Euro realm. Not convert it back to dollars (or whatever currency) in a year or so.

Second: the costs in Europe have not gone up in any way comparable to the amount Euro / Dollar has fallen. Neither I nor anyone else (I know) are concerned with this short term condition. In fact, the lower rate is making my decision to cover dollar debt and refinance in Euro debt for me.
Especially so for anyone that is overweight in long dollar assets (working assets as opposed to investment assets) and wanting more Euroland exposure with less cost. Borrowing Euros to invest in high return financial assets (Euro carry trade) is only a trade against exchange rates and in every
way has the smaller impact on Euro value over a long run. The booming demand for Euros is swamping the ability of US to supply liquidity fast enough to cover the liquidation of dollar debt. In spite of this much examined and overweighted carry trade.

Third: ECB is right, US dollar is up because a funding crisis is drying up dollar assets faster than Fed can supply. From the looks of everyone financing here, Euro is right about where it should be in value. It's the dollar that is spiking from a crisis.

----------------

Editor note: In a broad view just look at Japan. The Yen is being driven up from a long term crisis in their economy. The same thing is only now happening in our US. The difference is that we have "the" reserve currency and our eventual response to a "Japan like" economic condition will be to super inflate the dollar. That is something our fed is doing right now to keep the dollar from going even higher.

In another view, the ECB has the Euro doing what Japan has been fighting like mad to do for many years now. That is get a major world currency down against the dollar by having the dollar driven up from "debt transition demand". No different than as my friend uses his dollar reserves to cancel out his local (US) debt to reestablish in Euros. This effect expands the Euro in a good way but eliminates dollar liquidity in a bad way. The dollar rises from a liquidity "dry up" and this forces the fed to pump. But this kind of pumping floods our shores with dollars that can only function as "hot money" (stock market trading). Not used to finance real industry infrastructure.

If the Euro is causing any pain it is doing so to traders that made long derivative bets on that currency (not invest in it). They bet on the Euro being strong and the dollar being weak. None of then grasped that the Euro would be strong as a crisis of transition made the dollar even more in demand for liquidation.

Confirmation of this is found in the US fed and Treasury using every trick in the book to pump liquidity into dollar based assets. Alan is no fool, he isn't killing the stock market because he can't right now! If the dollar was strong from all the demand media says is out there, why must we pump money during a time our trade deficit is flooding the world with dollars. If the Euro is so week, why is everyone financing in Euros at a rate that's still building?

Thanks

Hello aunuggets,

Why stop there? What would keep the Gov. from taking all your cash? Ha! Ha! That's right, they could just call in all your money!

How about them taking the diamonds, china, 1/2 your food and
spare tires? Hell, they could even demand we turn in 2/3 of our stock certificates (gold shares included)! If they are half as stupid as we think, they may even want all the derivative contracts also (smile).

It doesn't take too much brain space to understand how one tries to structure his wealth to dodge as much "incoming" as possible! Pre-33 may or may not work, but it's a good bet it will.

Also: in the thick of things art work still holds it's premium. So do coins. When France fell, art, coins, china and anything rare was taken before all the rest. Even in Nam rare things held a higher price on the last days. I know some boys who were there.

As for "profit"? I have lived a long time and can't remember not paying a profit premium for anything or any service. In fact, the better the advice the cheaper the profit became. Yet, I have seen many, many people spout off that they pay almost no profit for something. In the end they got what they paid for.

But you knew this already. Just thought I would put in words for everyone, what you knew but forgot to say.

Just something to think about...... (big smile)

Hello ThaiGold,

Here is part of your article:

-----------------------------

City: Economic week: Interest rate fears dominate

TONY BLAIR was urged to rethink his commitment to the euro last night as the ailing currency suffered a fresh blow to its credibility.

Leading German financial experts issued a warning that it would fall further in value unless there was urgent economic reform. This was a clear sign that opinion formers at the heart of the eurozone are turning against the 16-month-old single currency. A week after it hit a record low against the dollar, there are now fears on the Continent that it is facing a full-scale crisis of confidence.

The most damaging attack was made by Prof Jürgen Donges, who heads a committee of five independent "wise men" which advises the German government on economic issues. He said that Germans had been told that the euro would be as strong as the mark, Europe's most successful post-war currency. But they had been bitterly disappointed.

-----------------------------------------

Thai,

Go to my above link and plug in German Marks to US Dollars.

You will notice that the Mark once brought .60 cents +/- in 1980 then plunged to buying .30 cents by 1985! What's that, a 50% loss against the dollar?

Then notice how it was at .72 cents in 1995, then plunged to .55 cents by 1997. What's that, another 30% loss?

The Mark was also spectacularly strong against the dollar at times. My point is that using the Euro as an excuse for European currencies to have fallen is all wet and these guys know it! The German people (and most of Europe) have known money fluctuations from their birth. The above "wise men" are not going to sell them on dumping the Euro on the grounds of it's recent exchange rate.

It's all politics, pure and simple. The anti Euro crowd in England is trying to sway Tony away from his well founded convictions. Still, Britain will join the EU as soon as possible because it represents a new future for them. I have well positioned advise that the dollar is going to begin it's decent this year. As soon as it does these political outcries by "fat cat special interest" will silence.
Believe it!

Read my last (recent?) post here about the Euro value. It's a convoluted story, but our modern 80 trillion derivative driven currency world make traditional money flows (and values) hard to fathom.

Besides, who's fooling who about the Euro? Quoting from today's WSJ currency page:

--------
"Even after the expected increase (talking about ECB Euro rates), the Central Bank's main refinancing rate would remain well below those in other western countries - at 3.5%, compared with 6% in the US and the United Kingdom".
--------

The Euro is weak? Give me a break? Some posters here only look at the exchange rate to see a currencies strength. That's good for the "trader crowd", but it doesn't begin to address the fundamental forces that truly impact a currencies real redeeming qualities. We are talking about real world "use" and the cost to implement that "use" in business. At these rates the Euro is smoking the dollar, hands down. Can you imagine what the exchange rate would be if Euro rates were raised somewhat close to Western rates?

The most exciting dynamic here is that these low Euro rates are building an economic infrastructure in a major world trading block. And doing it during an expansion in it's beginning timeline. And retaining a solid currency in the process.

I agree with the ECB: the Euro is fundamentally strong to the extreme, while the dollar is looking more like a Yen. So what if the dollar rises? It's strength is a sign of failure because our rates must be so high to maintain it. This same "high dollar rate" momentum, that traders love is just killing the international US debt quality from the trade deficit flood.

So do we want to have our assets in Japan instead of Euroland? Japan has a strong currency with 0% rates. Good, yes? Ha! That arena is in a crashing crisis and embarking on it's own hyper - inflation policy to try and control it. The Yen is strong because they are drying out! Our Dollar will
do the same, only we will gun rates higher in a "wind down" of reserve currency status. Just the opposite from Japan. Eventually, price inflation will eat the dollar on the exchange rate market, no matter what our interest rate is!

Further

Most TGBs attack the Euro story because it validates the current gold market dynamic "Another" laid out long ago. It ruins their passion for Gold stocks and gold derivatives as it proclaims that physical gold will at least match ( or far exceed) any possible run in these paper products. He
influenced this political process privately in the early 90s and publicly in the late 90s. To date the whole dynamic is proceeding and many other analysis are now moving in this direction. Truly, it's a transition on an epic scale.

think we could re-finance the house in Euros? Before the rush begins?
------------------
TG:
Oh, lord no! Not if you live in the US (smile). I think one could just buy some well located (in a safe area) homes financed in dollars (or cash (smile)) and hold them for the great run. I have done just that and am adding.
If one can buy (a home) in Euroland, plan on using it, not selling for dollar profits. I fully well expect big time exchange controls as this blows up. This is the same reason many investors save in Euros (and other currencies) in addition to local dollars. They don't bet on it (Euros) because it's a long term hedge as is.
---------------

Of course we'd have to hedge the future Euro/dollar rise, since we earn in dollars. That would be a call on Euros, or maybe a put on Tbonds (call on TYX). Just throw us on that $80 trillion derivative heap. Of course, we'd be first in line for collecting. Not!

Then we could broker our neighbors getting in on Euro re-fi's. Get our own Euro carry trade going.(Just think of the fees!) Oh, but the unwinding (big grimace!) ahead!

Yes, I have the same expression thinking about it. Some real serious international money is going to be in court for years trying to unravel it all.

Thank you Cavan Man!
The game is getting real hot now. The dollar and Yen are being gunned up to the point that their economies must become printing presses and no longer sell anything outside their borders. Right now there is almost nothing the Japanese can sell into Euroland at a profit! Japan needs desperately to sell more now and do so at a profit. The US is almost becoming a dollar exporting machine as the exchange markets begin to kill even their high tech exports.

It's going to continue until the Fed is forced from a crisis to cut rates to the bone (just like Japan). Then,,,,,,, exchange rates and price inflation will do their dirty work. Once that break happens, prices will suddenly jump ahead of the yield curve and the race will be on for the fed to follow it. It will evolve into the greatest inflation ever to impact a world currency.

Physical gold will be the easiest holding to sit through all this with.

Hello WAC!

I read your Buiter article and it was good. Concerning the British "higher ups" thinking they have engineered the economy and this has put a premium on the Pound: he puts the MPC in their place by saying "It's just twaddle"

Ha! Ha! WAC, I'm glad you found that item!

And he is so right in his perception. Just as you quoted: "It is just some big and largely irrational confidence discount on the euro and the ECB. And that will pass."

It seems like the entire dollar thinking world is on some new level of perception. Yet, their treasuries (and CBs) are just bankrupting everything that's left of the system and doing it in double time now.

Thank you for your realistic views in (usagold.com msg#: 29304).

I think the key word here is FUNDAMENTALS. The UK economy is been completed decimated. ---------

We will later see the effects of all this as it is played out in what MK calls "the currency wars". War is truly a much better name for it. While Western investors are preparing for a little $100 or $200 rise in paper gold (and worrying about how their paper gold substitutes will hold up until we get there), the whole damn dollar arena is on fire.
Everyone asks the same question you do about dollar arena currencies: "So, why does sterling continue to rise relentlessly?" Yet, in this day and time strength in these major currencies comes during a crisis. It's going to shock a lot of investors at how fast price inflation runs once the wars really get started. After the gold markets implode,
physical will rush as never before seen in history. Exciting times my friend!

The Euro is part of this trail!
Hello ALL:

This is a pre - weekend office review before our hike.

Here is some context from today's WSJ that reinforces what we have been talking about. I'll put it in my words but read it yourself in their paper.

In the World Watch section, under ECB Rate Rise:
----Inflation in the Euro zone may have peaked in march and now declining. ------ The CPI in all 11 countries rose 2.1% in march, year over year. ------- But analysts expect euro zone CPI to fall back to 1.8% this month and to 1.3% by end of year. ------ Three German states reported that prices were unchanged or fell in April / March. ------ Two other states reported similar data last week. -------- Italian cities reported inflation in April had declined from month before. -------
OK,

Does this sound like the major price inflation that was suppose to impact Euroland as their currency has fell for over a year? That's right, it's not! This is because the Euro Zone economy is "benefiting" from a sound currency structure. It's the Dollar that's is being driven ever higher into over valuation as it's reserve status is transitioned. The ECB / BIS are doing the same thing to the dollar that they are doing in gold right now. Allowing the Western Dollar faction to inflate and export (if able) the paper version of both items until they burst from supply.

In this process US interest rates must retain a large premium over Euro rates to support and over value the dollar as it's supply is pumped. This in turn drives performing financial structures (real world goods creation) into Euro assets because a sounder currency allows lower operating costs with the same or lower current price inflation. By this measurment, short term exchange rates are not the "use" deciding factor. If this continues, Euroland has the potential to take the lion share of world finance, and goods settlement. We are on that road today as a forced high dollar exchange rate is fueling our trade deficit! Yet, all of this is hiding under cover as the media only reports on the loses that traders take in the Forex markets.

Further from what I read in the WSJ under Foreign Exchange:
------ From an economist in New York ------ The European economy is strengthening. ---- European rates are rising. ------ And Europe is at an earlier stage in the business and restructuring cycle than the US, which suggest greater potential for price gains in the intermediate term. ------
Again,,,,,

Breaking the dollar's hold on world reserve status means forcing it into a major price inflation at the end of it's timeline. This is done by tying the hands of policy makers so they can only create (pump) more dollar assets into the world system. That "tying of hands" is done by creating for the first time an alternative currency structure that does not fail from continued dollar "crisis strength" or "crisis weakness". The world economy will run to just such a system as their current system (the dollar) fails.

The US is now trapped because they cannot lower rates to bring down dollar exchange rates without gunning their stock market and economy into an obvious hyper inflation. Yet, they cannot raise rates any further without causing a complete landslide of investors into using the lower cost Euro system.

Hence the little 1/4 point rate rises Alan is doing. He and the dollar are now trapped from all the outstanding dollar debt in the world. The whole mountain is now slowly sliding down the slope as we watch. Is it no wonder that gold leaves our shores in record amounts.

In the past, no one would rock the boat in such an obvious way as the ECB / BIS is doing because everyone would lose as the dollar eventually was discarded. But today, the Euro Zone system has taken a second step to backup their Euro banking reserve structure when the fall comes.

In an ever so obvious event they told the world that the Dollar based world paper gold markets are "on the road" to being phased out. That event was the Washington Agreement. If you have read my earlier "trail walks", you know how this action is slowly drying up supportive gold supply that gives credibility to the paper gold markets. The eventual outcome of this is to allow the current contract markets to be supported by the US and it's backers alone. To date, without world support there is not enough gold supply to keep these contracts at par with spot bullion prices.

In a desperate attempt to keep dollar gold prices from spiking, the dollar faction must inflate it's contract market to the same extent that the dollar itself is being created. Without this paper supply, the paper gold markets would show a discount to physical just as world dollar debt would discount dollar price inflation without more created dollars to buy existing debt supply.

The stage is now set for a fall in the dollar and a corresponding leap in the "dollar reserve replacement value" of gold held in the BIS system. The point is clear for all to see,,,,,,,, when a crashing dollar exchange rate comes from dollar price hyper inflation,,,,,, and drains world liquidity and value from dollar holdings,,,,,,,,,,, gold and Euros will fill that void. The Euro system is completely braced to accept a US self induced transition of world reserve status from the dollar into Euros. It's no accident that the breaking of the world gold market structure and dollar price inflation will come about just as the Euro comes to center stage. Euro depth grows every day and brings in ever more players seeking opperations value.

Now you know what "Another" has know for some time. Now you know why gold is and must rise far, far higher than anyone expects or predicts. Now you know why our paper gold contract market is about to fail as a "freegold" physical market takes over. Gold in the many, many thousands is in our future as the transition to Euro reserve status is set to begin.

Another:

"We watch this new gold market together, yes?"

I want to start by making my personal opinion more clear. Some of you that know what talk is coming are smiling already. But, this is for some of the newer ones.

First point:

It's shocking to me when I hear that so many are still trying to figure out "gold's place in the world". Some people even question whether gold is any kind of wealth worth owning, let alone be a substantial portion of their savings! With this mindset is it no wonder that this current slice of "Western Investors" can be so easily bilked out of their "hard money" savings. Instead of saving gold for coming currency devaluation's, these same try to only profit from gold's current small price movements. It's an old strategy built to fight yesterday's gold wars and it's costing them plenty. Here- in, we see there is a huge difference from our position and what they are trying to accomplish. In the quest for profits they have taken the Fiat bait, "hook, line and sinker" and brought into fiat gold substitutes in every form.

But, I guess it must be this way. The financial convulsions that lie just ahead cannot possibly occur with everyone holding physical gold. At least not at any kind of currency prices we see today. Perhaps this is just one more signal of the end of this financial era as we know it. Somewhere in the "good book" I read where in the end many would throw their metal in the streets. By buying gold substitutes we may be seeing a whole segment of our world savers literally tossing the metal before the fact.

Let me expand:

We, physical gold advocates, have largely built our views from the actions of several smart players. Players we perceive are out there in significantly large numbers. Here we find a kind of thinking that's completely opposite from the dollar asset world most (Americans) live in.

When all of us hear of someone buying gold with no intention of ever selling it for dollars, we laugh! What good or profit could they ever derive from it? Well, a lot of paper gold bugs are going to understand this real soon. In a way that's kind of "up front and personal"! Our fellow "Trader Gold Bugs" all firmly agree that it's much better to hold a trading position on some form of gold derivatives. In their view, mining shares, stock and gold futures options offer a much better play and much better profit potential than physical gold. At least in dollar profits, that is.

All of this is fine and probably very true in their world of perception. But we have to remember that these TGBs all present their case for a higher value of gold as "the reason" to play the paper derivatives game. Whether gold's value rises from an industrial use physical shortage or induced from a currency devaluation (price inflation) physical shortage, they see the currencies as bad and gold as good. But the deep flaw in this thinking is found in this: "Playing paper gold substitutes is only a game that tries to make you more of the same currency that's failing from price inflation"! It's a currency game that's apart from owning physical gold. In other words their position is: "if fiat prices are rising 10% or 20% I want to make at least that much more of those currency units so as to keep me ahead". Even if they get delivery in gold against paper contracts or receive some gold as a dividend from a mine, they need and intend to sell it for cash to profit.

Whether their gold stocks are surging or their stock dividends are rising or the leverage of futures options are gunning ahead,,,,, the gain "in the mind" and "in the hand" still comes in the same fiat you are losing against. You play the game because the money is somewhat failing, but keep making more of the same failing money to stay ahead! Get my picture? That's ok when the currency was just inflating a little and world governments were trying to save said currency. But the currency war ahead will paint an entirely different picture in these markets. The next price inflation will build well past "plain inflation" and explode into Hyper-inflation.

It all comes down to you playing with a paper gold supply that's supposed to represent gold you could conceivably get, if needed. But the closer we get to the "real act" in this play, the more the paper game is inflated with supply that cannot be covered outside a cash settlement. That is a simple position to understand and work from but just look around? The "Western Mind" is stumbling all over itself in an attempt to explain it with a different outcome. In other words: There must be a way this can all work out so as to preserve our dollar and the leverage we own in these paper gold substitutes. You see, it's the perceived leverage in paper games that keep them coming back, but official policy has changed these markets in order to conduct a now ongoing currency war! Paper gold leverage is only an illusion built on the desires of dollar players trying to prosper in a dollar position. Well, I can tell you that the further we travel this trail, the higher the eventual cash settlement of all gold paper will be and the less that settlement will be allowed to match any "free physical" price.

This, my friends is the reason so many Physical Gold Advocates have no intention of selling their physical gold for dollars any time soon. "They don't expect the dollar to retain enough real value to warrant trading it for gold. At any price! When the "real act" begins to play out, international gold will be settled outside the dollar world and done so far above the coming forced contract cash settlement prices. Whether traded "outright" or for a "better" currency, gold and the current dollar derivative world will part ways.

By holding physical gold you are owning a super leveraged "derivative" that will be exchangeable against the value of real things at a par level lost to the minds of most investors. Today, physical gold purchased in dollar values is discounting it's worth by perhaps 100 times. For us PGAs, that is a leverage worth "playing the physical game for"! (smile)

Second Point

(that smoked salmon is good, no? go ahead, there's more here)

I have made it clear that I follow in the footsteps of giants and by extension remain in Another's shadow. We have been buying gold all through the 90s as a portion of out savings. It's held just like any other currency and represents a major portion of the (my) pie. I also own some gold stocks (smile). But own them in a portion and for a reason that any leading gold mine executive can only crave:

"they are held not for trading and in small enough portion that they will never be sold".

In effect, we own their product first and foremost for the real world, long term leverage it represents. We own a share in their business with a far away view across the "coming currency war valley". In the middle of that valley, amiss the war, we expect some of these businesses to survive by changing into the Euro world. But, most all of them will experience a crushing collapse in equity values during the war. My view to the other ridge sees a gold price, so high, that it will eventually overcome taxation, government production controls and even the failing dollar based contract gold market. Even though these shares will plunge "in the valley", my holdings are such a percentage that I will own them "through it all". This is why I own only a few of the very best and one in particular.

For all of you here today, contrast this position against the trader of the last few years? During the worst plunge in paper gold assets seen in a quarter century, these same have lost most of it through their leverage. In and out, in and out, and all the while saying they are only "a little down"! Then, at the slightest little rise in their paper positions, it's given that this proves they are right. Right in that paper leverage beats physical any day. I submit that the way traders work, they will be lucky to be even as gold runs past $1,000.

Again, Yen, Euros, dollars and Marks are in my savings position, but physical gold is held as the derivative that will best outvalue them all! I do not trade these positions, I build and save them. The coming political transition from dollar reserve use will break the paper gold markets into cash settlement pieces. In that process, induced by this Euro / Dollar war, physical gold will outperform any any all failing paper gold. The value is there to own today and anyone can have it! Events will prove that the footsteps we follow have placed on "the real gold trail".

Now, onward the hike.
See you there in an hour or so.

I see Gold!

Onward

Anyone following these walks knows I am not the best at putting the trail into words. We must therefore rely on events (and other writers) to demonstrate the real world around us. Recently the completion of the Swiss gold sale is a case in point. Here you have a country known for it's pragmatic hard money trends, yet it's selling gold. Something they would never do unless the process could in some way return the lost value back to them.

Trading Swiss gold into the BIS system gives further support to the Euro "free gold" cause. Giving the ECB / BIS more control over how physical gold is allocated only further starves the dollar paper gold world. Having once backed a low dollar price of gold for oil, the Swiss helped build and sustain the same contract gold infrastructure that would eventually be the undoing of the dollar. Today, they further align themselves with the Euro world just as a "deflationary" phase is set to impact the dollar dominated gold banking world. In the end, gold values will be much better with the Euro pricing a Free Gold marketplace. This in turn will mark to market the remaining Swiss stocks of gold at a higher level than could be currently achieved. Add to this a strong Euro system and the benefits will be enormous.

Gold banking paper deflation will lead to Gold banking paper inflation

Just as deflation in a currency block is caused from the defaulting of currency loans, we are on the same road in the gold banking business. Such deflation is cured the same way in both instances, paper printing! Be it gold paper or currencies.

In the end, a currency deflation is halted by supplying the currency units until rising prices become an obvious default of the fiat money. For you and I the prices of everything race ahead. For business caught on the wrong side of this, it's hell! In other words, the dollar prices of real physical things rise higher than many business contracts can deliver against. Hyper - inflation bankrupts businesses that agreed to supply a physical item at a price they can no longer buy it for. Whether tires, tools, batteries or gold bullion, anyone writing supply contracts that last into a major price inflation will end up settling those contract in cash. That is up to the limits of their capital. Then, only if the treasury deems them important enough does the government prop them up with more public cash to bail them out. This endless circle goes on until all currency contracts fail from the loss of credibility.

Our current world dollar gold contract business is arriving at this same juncture with different results. Paper gold markets expanded to meet investor demands. The only difference between now and in the past is that "Western investors" today want to invest in the price movements of gold, not use gold as a money holding. The demand for gold today became the demand for leveraged gold paper. Instead of selling real gold to meet demand, governments, bankers and brokers created more contract gold. In the same way that people borrow cash created out of thin air, would be gold owners and traders brought a lot of gold credits based on nothing but thin air. The paper market expanded until a political change now threatens it with default deflation.

Just like a fiat currency, modern gold currency is only credible until prices start rising against it. It will start out with a settling of contracts with only a percentage of physical and the rest in cash. Then, in the same way as prices rise against a currency during an inflation, physical gold prices begin to rise against paper gold. Slowly but surely, less and less gold is supplied against contracts until we end up with total cash settlement. All along, the physical "free gold" market trades at a higher and higher currency price. This, my friends is what dollar hyper - inflation may look like in our modern paper gold markets. The selling of paper gold "into the dirt" even as all prices run away.It may last for an hour, a week, six months or several years, but it will unfold this way. As long as investors believe in paper gold, their wealth will be slowly absorbed by physical gold buyers until trading breaks down. Eventually we have the super failure that locks up the entire paper gold arena and ends it for good as everyon's holdings are marked to the real market.

Further

On another note, please read ORO #29003 and especially #29498 on the USAGOLD Forum. His Euro Crush and Dollar spike describe many of the items that impact our currency world. These same forces are also shaping the transition of the gold markets.

I noted this past week how the dollar rose against the Euro. Many rushed to proclaim the Euro weak and failing. I have to ask: "without a dollar to compare exchange rates to, how would anyone measure the Euro's weakness"?

If you lived in the Euro Zone countries, with a bank account full of Euro credits, what impact on your lifestyle would lead you to see how the Euro is weak? Against what? For myself, I can find none! In fact, most all prices of goods are rising slower than in the US. I can borrow money at lower rates than in the US. The Swiss unit is falling and costs there are out of site! The Pound carries interest so high I would certainly not give up my Euro system to operate there. Here in Euroland I sell more abroad than I bring in.

Perhaps the world is not what it seems!

The view:

The dollar faction is having a hard time keeping paper gold under $280. Now that the world has seen how the WA is placing Swiss Euro Gold, the paper markets should start to discount physical. I think weeks are all the time the dollar faction has left before things begin to change!

Thanks for hiking with me

THC (5/5/2000; 5:31:38MT - usagold.com msg#: 29970)

Hello THC,

I'll add my 2 cents to your discussion.

You say:
---- I believe that FOA has spoken from time to time of "paper being sold into the ground" while "physical gold sells at much higher prices away from the futures markets." I would content that as long as futures markets are connected to physical markets through the physical delivery rules, this would seem to be highly implausible. -----

The obvious weak part here is in your
" " through the physical delivery rules" " !

These rules are open to change. If enough traders or commercials default, no one is going to supply physical for them. The "rules" convert to "trade for liquidation only". That is usually a trade of "paper to paper". In other words "cash settlement". If you were short you lost a bunch. If you were long, you get cash and go try to buy your own metal.

The problem is that in this atmosphere any amount of metal trading will be spiking straight up with each bulk cash settlement.

The reason this perspective is important is that the "paper makers" know just how this will impact the paper markets. In reality, no one that has real capital will buy into a paper marketplace headed for any form of liquidation. So it becomes even easier for them to send prices lower. Even a hint of settlement is enough. If anything at all, during this process the arbitrage is just the opposite from
normal. Traders help the discounting process along by dumping contracts that are even in obvious discount to physical and running to buy "dealer physical" supply at higher prices.

Contracts are contracts my friend. Nothing more until settled. In a real crisis, cool arbitrage players get run down by the train as they find their own physical that was set to trade becomes "suddenly not there"! As the gold markets grind to default, the paper selling by people with nothing more than good credit will greatly intensify.

Hello Trail Guide
Two questions please:
1.) Will you tell us of your favorite gold stocks?
--------------
I once said one and will hold back from mentioning it (or others) again. The Western view says that if I have $100,000 to put into hard assets, I'll buy ten ounces and place the rest in gold stocks. I doubt most people could hold that ratio through what is most likely coming.

It's the same as using the grocery money to buy Coca Cola stock as a substitute for a bottle of coke. All the same arguments apply: the company could pay me dividends in coke,,,,, there reserves of coke in storage are huge,,,,,,,, more leverage than the real thing,,,,,,etc.,,,,, etc.,,,,!
Then the stock goes down in a general crisis even as the price of a cold coke goes up from inflation and everyone can't figure it out?? In the end you open the frig door and don't see what you really need........ that cold bottle of coke (smile).


2.) Have you been in the very general vicinity of Aiken, SC recently. I'm trying to confirm a sighting:).

Have you been celebrating that mexican holiday??? (smile)

-----------------------------
If they are giving up their own ability to print money, why all the trouble to form a new currency unit instead of just joining the dollar and the currency union of 50 states plus assorted banana republics that use the dollar? The reasonable answer is that the intended objective is a
fundamentally new monetary architecture not available through the current dollar system.------

Hello TownCrier,

You hit the nail right on the head! The whole purpose behind all of this was to get away from the dollar, not imitate it. All the hard money people that pounded the table about the dirty float (80s decade) in dollar exchange rates now want the ECB to intervene. No sooner do we have a currency system that let's the market rule it and everyone says "Oh no! We need to do something".

I can tell you why they want something done and it's not the saving of the Euro they are interested in. They (the dollar faction) want the Euro up because it is gutting the dollar infrastructure at these rates. Just let it set around .90 for the rest of the year and the dollar will be toast. The ECB won't spend it's dollar reserves buying Euros because the Euros they would take in won't be the international float like our dollars (eurodollars?? damn confusing to use that term now a days) overseas. It would be the domestic zone supply. We forget that they are running a trade surplus
that is building local assets denominated in Euros not dollars. Not adding to the mountain of dollar liabilities like the US trade deficit is. If the carry trade wants to create Euros against their own equity just to buy dollar assets, let them. It's not hurting the international Euro float because all of it is being sucked back into their (Euro) economy. The carry group thinks this is the same act as Japan, but it's not. The Yen is being destroyed as they compress and rates are held at 0%. Yen demand for business is dead. Contrast this against Euro demand and economic growth and we can see a massive trap for Euro shorts in the making.

I think this is all coming to a head now and gold is going to be in the middle of it. Before this is over, the ECB is going to begin unloading dollars for gold through the BIS offices. This may be happening now as gold moves from our shores. Then they use gold to buy excess Euros from the
ECMBs. That same gold could be used to lend Euros again because it's marked free value reserve asset. No different than the IMF play. Beautiful!

ORO (5/7/2000; 3:25:29MT - usagold.com msg#: 30083)

Hello ORO,

A few comments about your work.

-------Particularly surprising was how right Davidson and Reese Mogg were about the dollar debt squeeze.----------

ORO, It has to unwind through a reserve transition. Default will only come through inflation after the fact. That is the only way a modern reserve currency can revert back to a regular currency without a complete washout of the global financial structure. Call it what we want, inflation, deflation, default or devaluation, the loss of the ability to expand a reserve fiat further becomes an end time banking crisis that requires the next system to take over. If no replacement is available we all go down.

The problem of when is a currency no longer "reserve quality" is based more on it's expansion qualities than it's comparable exchange strengths. The failing point is reached when the local economic system can no longer supply products or new productive capabilities in sufficient quantity to expand the internal debt base for real use reasons. The money then just expands because it's "Legal Tender" and anyone can get some. This shuts off the real money making engine and forces currency creation only for the sake of it's ability to buy and finance things. Not it's ability to hold a steady value. In other words, more dollars are loaned into existence just because they still have some value left in them to trade for things and that value is based on debt pay back strength. Not because their creation is matched by a productive increase somewhere in the society.

Obviously the US has been on this path for some time. Today, the only reason the dollar still has value is because of this pay back crisis. Dollar denominated debt is so far out of line with it's perceived real economic base, the rush is on to move real world infrastructure debt out of dollars
and leave the rest of these dollar claime sloshing around as trading vehicles. And boy that's a lot of slosh to move around.(smile)

They (ECB / BIS) planed for the day when this could begin and it's here, now! The Euro, warts and all is allowing this transition. In time everyone will realize that dollar demand and strength is gravitating towards nothing more than international currency contract settlement. It has no reflection of US economic conditions or the value of our real assets. For large cross country players and
governments there is no escape from this. They cannot just dump dollars to get their equity back out of it because there isn't enough free "REAL" equity in the whole world to run to at today's prices. The only way is to hold an offset position and let the dollar self destruct through inflation. Is it no wonder the foreign CBs have supported the dollar system by holding and taking in more dollars? How could everyone possibly run out of the dollar? They couldn't and won't for the most part, but will sell what they can.

Gold value today and tomorrow will have nothing to do with economic supply and demand or the cost to mine it. It will be forced to rise in value to help represent trading wealth currently held and trapped in dollars. The Euro could never do it alone. Of course, dollar hyper-inflation will gun the
process, but physical gold in real goods terms is heading way up! That's why I laugh when people talk about $700 or $800 gold being about right. That's not even close.

Again, dollar strength today is a sign of a bad situation and will only get worse. It will gut the productive infrastructure of this country even as the fed super inflates the system to fight that strength.

Your words:
----------The reason a bank debt currency carries a value at all, and does not go directly to 0 is that each unit was borrowed into existence and has a demand by the borrower to return the currency created by his loan. -----------

Yes! This hits right at the heart of why I call our dollars only an illusion of wealth. Truly it's just a contract
that can and is created between two entities with banks as the broker. The person that sees dollar value based on this demand and then holds those dollar assets as his wealth,,,,, is buying into an illusion based on that contract relationship. It's ok to own fiat money based on this concept because the human world has built a lot of value through the ongoing building of currency debt based on real productive efforts. But our money denominations and supply today are nowhere close to that comparison. Unless a free market value for gold can be established where one can
gauge the quality of all outstanding contract relationships (money supply), we cannot know where we stand. Allowing a real gold price to always rise (or contract) with no limits turns it into something better than circulating government money. It becomes a circulating asset that represents
real wealth values at all times to all people. We are on that road today.

Further you make the point that:

---------The BIG GAPING HOLE in this system is that there is no such thing as cash--------

I agree and doubt there will ever be again. This is where gold traded as an asset instead of competing with money would fill that hole.

Thanks Trail Guide

Hello Topaz,
Thanks for reading and considering my offerings. Actually I don't expect or ask anyone to act or believe any of this. It's placed here to offer a view from another place and a future time. A way to see how some others interact with the ongoing money changes in our world today.

In your post:

---------Topaz (5/8/2000; 4:48:11MT - usagold.com msg#: 30108) On this Trail: "I'll tak the High Road and Ye'll tak the low road" and we'll both get to "Scotland" (eventually). {;])----------

Topaz,

To comprehend Another's Thoughts is to understand that you and he are not on the same road! Indeed, most if not the majority of Western gold investors will find themselves in Scotland to only then know they lost a great deal by ending up there. Watching the current gold markets, accepting their pricing mechanisms and using today's paper vehicles to play this arena will land most traders in Scotland but unable to buy gold. The physical price will have ran far, far past
whatever leveraged gains they made.

It's easy to see the leveraged traders by reading their verbal trails. They are completely fixated on "wanting" our current arena to work for them. All of their understanding and drive is centered on using the various forms of paper gold. Yet, this entire infrastructure and most of the mine equity that's built upon it has from the beginning been just another currency the dollar governments uses to take "Western minds" away from buying real gold. You see my friend, physical gold is where the real leverage is and the dollar faction have know this all along.

The entire marketplace we call the gold market is all based on a working dollar world. Everything that's paper and called gold has it's roots deeply leveraged not in gold but the dollar return on gold. There is not a paper gold investment in the world today that has seen a gold spike like the one that is coming. Likewise no investor has ever held or seen how these paper markets can cope with just
such a move. None!

I submit to you and everyone that will consider that profits from paper in this move will pale in comparison to holding physical.

You write:
--------It is apparent you perceive the current pricing mechanism (spot- futures) will implode and the POG reduced accordingly until the "penny drops" ie: Paper and Physical will go their separate ways--- Ok so far?

------You came to this conclusion several months ago after "enlightenment" from ANOTHER source. (we all remember the fracas that erupted resulting in Sir Stranger's sin-binning) Since then, the possibility of an upside explosion in POG has been totally discounted.-----------

Topaz,
Nothing about this has been discounted in our paper or physical gold price. We stand where we did almost a year ago when we (both of us) delivered this message. I expected then and even more so now that a default is near. The WA was the concrete fact that placed us "on the road" to super gold! It is indeed coming and will arrive in our time.

The price move (spike) last Sept. was certainly not anything close to the lock up move ahead. When the season is right and motivations strong enough: oil will begin it's move for the Euro, the dollar will begin it's crisis and our paper gold markets will completely fail from lack of bullion.

Your words:
------For the benefit of those who still cling to the hope of a steady rise in the price, can you offer your thoughts on what is now a contrary alternative to your scenario? Just for the record I would like to cite the reason I consider the Status-quo will be maintained throughout this transition:- Accepting that Au is the centre of the Fiscal Universe and as such, (has/is/) will be manipulated by
opposing interests, is it not to the ultimate benefit of both sides to effect a controlled burn to the upside thus not jeopardizing the perception of Fiat currencies as a whole? (Similar to a nuclear standoff- where no-one wins if all the cards are played) I mean to say- If all holders of paper Au find themselves getting shafted, it may well have the effect that these large players/ countries etc will
even turn away from all forms of Fiat settlement and go straight to Metal which is in no-ones interests -No? Whereas, a steadily rising price (in fits and starts) can be (once again) perceived as the inflation indicator it is. The outcome would be the same in the end--Yes? I hope this sufficiently explains my thinking and look forward to your comments.-------------

Topaz,

There is no contrary alternative! The game at play has been "in play" for some time and processed through several age groups. The American dollar has reached the end of it's ability to function as a world reserve currency. It's debt load has aged it past it's useful timeline. From where I consider the world, this is obvious and has been for a number of years.

Because gold has been "the world tool" that all used to kept our dollar alive for these last days, it will be the first item to fall away from being a dollar support. This paper gold tool will fail as the dollar transition proceeds. It will fail because it's illusion will be seen through physical default. Today, it's only a matter of time. This default will break the paper gold support tool and shut down
virtually all dollar gold markets.

Once this breaks, there will be no "Western Investors" with a mindset to any longer buy paper gold. Having been badly burned and watching physical gold soar, it will be a long, long time before anyone is ever again "sold" on the idea of "gold substitute holdings". Not even gold in the ground
will bring them back. New taxes will make gold mining nothing more than what it always was, a business.

The Euro / BIS have positioned their official policy and reserve holdings to benefit strongly from a surge in value of "free gold". Contrary to your thoughts, they will welcome this change, promote it and utilize it's wealth building perception for public gain. Just as we have talked here so often: for better or worse, digital Euros and super "free gold" will set the pace in Euroland and the world.

The manipulations of gold you speak of are "old stuff" and are today a "dying process" at the hands of the BIS. I think many OLD GOLD bugs will find themselves "broken down" on the side of the road as events surge past their backward looking understanding. The road where they stall will be the one that leads to your Scotland.

The future my friend is before us and those that can see it will be on a different trail. They will be "on the road with Free Gold"! The Gold Trail we walk today starts far in our past and has become a direction to a new future. Walk it with me and see the world in a new light.


Thank you

Elwood, SteveH,

Hello, both of you.

This placement of Swiss gold was the first "real obvious" indication to the markets of what the WA is all about. Because these sales are the bulk of physical entering the markets during the next 5 years, something has to give as it is diverted into BIS accounts. Remember, I touched on this point on the Trail (when?): the WA did not address any means of covering existing contracts while still endorsing and maintaining their gross level outstanding! Most everyone completely missed the fact that this places "physical coverage" squarely on the back of the US if the paper markets are to be maintained. No one saw this as an issue because they assumed the Swiss gold was for coverage.
It's not!

I know The Golden Sextant is following that line of Swiss gold filling Euro loans. The problem is that it's not. They feel comfortable letting the dollar faction figure it out themselves. Euro Zone banks know that the entire Gold arena will shut down once this US supply line is cut off. They are
not so dumb as to fill their paper with physical when the rest of the world is force settling in cash. They will not " blanket" cover all loans. Just the important ones vital to oil supply. This is the real leverage that will bring on Oil for Euros! Get the picture!

Elwood, I agree that everyone is still trying to milk whatever gold out of the system they can get. This was a driving factor for allowing the US to "save some face" by forcing oil prices down some. Onec the gold flow stops (and it may be right now) oil ril rise fast and furious!

SteveH's repost of my "weeks" timeline is on track. Untapped official gold is running out and unless someone rolls over a huge paper commitment the game begins "real soon". We watch!

Mothers: the only real gold of this earth!
Hello to everyone!

No hiking today. Let's just ramble on about some recent discussion and do it in a relaxed format. This is an especially good time to do this because most all investors are softened in spirit from mothers day. Yes, we all came from somewhere and even thought us guys try to take credit, it's the mothers that worked the magic! I am of an age where my mother is long sense pasted, but still celebrate the occasion with those of the new generation.

After a good dinner, a few glasses of fine wine and exceptionally good company, I'm now writing this piece. Thought you should know this (smile). Having read lightly through the USAGOLD forum I / we want to touch on a few things.

Yes Leigh,
"it's a beautiful day for a hike". Thank you for considering (smile)!

Peter Asher,
indeed the American public and private debt still grows. Yet, we as clear minded, broad thinking conservative citizens are expected to believe this debt has no end. This debt growth process alone is enough to make one seek financial cover. All of the economic facts , figures, projections and sentiment don't make a hill of beans compared to the corrosive powers of the total US dollar based debt. This alone completely overwhelms any near term bullish considerations. No economy in the history of mankind has survived long enough to make good on this magnitude of IOUs. None! This country will be forced, in our time, to hyper inflate us out from under a debt than cannot be covered. This is a proven fact from the beginning of all history, especially that of paper money.

From Another:
Mr.YGM,
you are a miner, I see. Good fortune for you any your family. I encourage your support for GATA and all who fight against the suppression of "FreeGold". Soon, a foreign political tide will turn strongly against the American dollar and drown it's policy of maintaining this paper gold
marketplace. When the great tide changes, the current will be like wind in a miner's sails. But my friend, it will be an exceptionally strong breeze. One seldom felt on desert nights. Only the strongest boats will race before our storm. My only fear on this day is that your people voice no clear
understanding of how this change will affect the trading of physical gold. They still long for the past and a return to an honest, supportive paper gold marketplace. They base their financial plans on $600+/- gold in context of a concurrent futures / paper market. I submit to you it will never happen. Paper gold will live with falling prices or die a horrible death. No middle path will modern miners walk. May your best dreams be as a fortune in hand's grasp.

Thank You, Another
FOA,

Hello TownCrier! My best to your Mother (smile).
Your item on the German 20 mark was an fabulous piece. It tells a true story that few can believe today. Those coins are both a part of history and the future. I read some of Holtsman's article and have to add something.

Many people today picture gold as an evolving asset that's only just now showing it's real potential. Perhaps this is seen in a context that gold value never did represent people, rather it represented our created wealth on this planet. Yes, actual physical gold, in ounces, has increased dramatically over the human time span. But, never before in history has human physical creation been as it is today. The real wealth assets of our modern world have increased thousands of times over the mined gold supply! Had mankind not intervened over these last 50+ years and created gold substitutes, there is no telling what gold would be worth.

As the only real wealth money this earth has ever had, it's unthinkable what value physical gold would have had to attain to denominate our created holdings. This is where so many "gold advocates" completely sell themselves short in projecting gold's future price. They try to somehow reconcile gold's value with it's cost of production. In fact, once man's drive to attach his official currency / fiat money to gold is broken (as it is about to be), all the gold "IN" the earth today could not represent human created things at 10 times it's current price! Throw in the fact that the earth will not give up all it's gold any time soon, present world gold holdings in reserve currency today must rise in value at least 100 times to match what assets now exist. On top of that add in the fact that dollar gold will go sky high just to equal past dollar creation (as the dollar fails) and one can see where physical gold is "the play" in modern times. Forget stocks, business valuations, land or currencies: physical gold is the wealth for the next generation. The generation that in "our time" came from today's "Mothers" (smile).

But TownCrier,,,, you already know this. Perhaps I am expanding on your thoughts? ,,,,, if so, then it's good for you, me and everyone here!

Hi - Hat,
The people at the Hi-Hat ranch have a pigeon shoot (target practice) using real birds, no? A friend of mine said it caused a controversy there recently. It's a practice commonly used in other parts of the world. It's the same with our gold perception, just depends on where one has been and who we have known.

Oil begun rising in dollar terms again, even though many thought some deal was cut! Well, cheap oil is hard to maintain now that the Euro is breaking our paper gold market. It seems that only real gold flow will slow the oil rise. Today, derivitive gold is on the way out! Let me tell you, this revelation is sinking in on American policy. Without cheap oil, this Western economic illusion is going to fade quickly. And with it will also go the Western illusion of value in paper gold.

Like those in the rest of the world, a Sovereign Individual will be the one with real gold.

Henri,

You say
-----I hereby nominate the overextended timelime of the US dollar on life support for one of the great wonders of the modern world. Certainly on a par with the Colossus of Rhodes.-----
Ha! Ha! Never in the history of human endeavor has such a debt been built! I dare say it is greater than the seven wonders. When I listen to how players plan their next investment based on TA, I fully understand their narrow view. Truly, they are trading paper deeds as Rome burns!

Rhody,

You say,
-----The only gold mining company that I know has the capacity to fabricate both gold jewelry products and bullion wafers is Harmony Gold Mines. It would appear to me, that this gold equity (paper gold investment vehicle) would have the potential to shift its product sales into EUROs should the buying power of USDs implode. Do you know of any other such companies?-------
Quite a few miners are talking (very privately) about how they could sell their product "outright". The problem is that they have built their whole financial plan on selling gold to the "middlemen" first. So, now that paper gold has priced their product to a bare bones margin level, they have no resources to just "cut and run". When the "real" "next" physical gold bull breaks open, it will be lightning fast and lock the very market mines must sell into. Truly, it will be pandemonium at it's best!

The calls for "derivative cancellation" and "physical delivery" will wreck every possible banking network in the food chain. Both good and bad, solvent and bankrupt. There will be no market for gold in the banking world and these same BBs will be demanding all mine loans be settled from any miner that starts selling his product publicly before it's all settled out. Technically, many mines will be placed in default and their shares sold because their product is frozen.

There will be some huge profits to be made by holding certain mine stocks. But, almost all of them will go close to zero first. I doubt many investors could hold their current percentage through this price action. Physical gold will find a new market and soar in that medium of trade. In the face of this, few if any stockholders will hold their falling mining shares while watching gold soar. Yes, some will (like me) hold through thick and thin because they have a right percentage of (the best) mine shares to bullion. But, many, many others will pressure the market as they attempt to adjust to (our)level of holdings.

Companies that are "unhedged" and somewhat profitable at around $280 may attempt to restructure their bullion sales "near term". The problem comes in where so many "western share holders" do not believe that our paper markets are "maintained" much less about to destruct. So they vote for a status quo while waiting for some "legal" or "political" action to return us to "normal" paper prices. For these companies and their share holders, this backward view is the wet concrete that will set up and freeze their wealth as gold later soars.

As an aside, I hope the US will enter the paper arena and allow a controlled burn as paper prices rise. This would be the most "saving grace" for all long derivative (and stock) players. But the leverage creation has been so immense these last few years that I am afraid Another is completely right. All paper will burn! Completely!

Thanks on this Mother's day

-------If the paper POG goes to $0 separating from the physical price, how will physical gold be valued? Is it conceivable that an individual's gold holdings might appear to be worth less for a period of time and if so, how long do you think? Also, could you comment on Euro denominated
equities? I've been looking at the EAFE index as well. ----------

-------I'm still not clear on what mechanism will provide price discovery for gold in this new market we watch together. -----

Cavan Man,

Gold will be valued at the currency price physical dealers trade it for. On the spot! Done deal on the barrel head! I use my right hand to grab the cash in your left hand while you grab the gold in my left hand,,,,, Viking style! (smile)

A real life, true supply and demand market! You and I will know it's price the same way you know the price (value) of a loaf of bread. It's the price where one can walk into a store, hand over your currency and walk out with the goods.

Let your mind drift over all the things you can buy today, on the spot. Truly, real life isn't about buying an option that settles in one futures contract for August delivery of "underware". Then taking delivery of that contract and later settling that for a warehouse receipt of Jockey Briefs (smile).

But that is exactly what the paper gold boys have sold the American public on doing. It's become so far removed from reality that many (perhaps yourself) have a seriously hard time grasping how anything can be priced without some huge contract market setting the value.

I expect a period of confusion to rein as this all blows up. This is "exactly" why having physical gold will so greatly benefit the average person. When all the markets are closed for a while, paper holders will have absolutely no value in their hands. Yet, somewhere in the world physical gold will
be trading and it's value will be known. I and many others are betting on 2,000+ years of human history that this will be fact.

I mentioned before that Euro accounts are more for someone that can live there (part time?) and spend and invest their currency there. Even though I can see one day when Euros are held and used here in the US (like dollars in Mexico), I cannot see the average US investor (working family person) having Euros now. Physical gold would do just as well on a functioning basis and outstanding on a return basis. Please understand, our Euro discussion is more to explain the "why"
of the evolution of paper gold and gold's eventual real price. The Euro is not the focus for investment even though myself and others see it as the next major currency.

Hope this helps?

Gold Leasing Jigsaw Puzzle Part 2.

Hello Elwood and ALL!

Elwood, your post was on target. I'll be giving a full comment on it in a day or two. Also will discuss the paper derivatives buildup at banks. How they are preparing to profit from a shutdown and crash in the whole dollar / gold / trading system. Indeed, here the largest financial players in the world are selling paper gold into the dirt while "paper gold bugs" are counseling investors to buy more gold substitutes! Guess which side understands Another's Thoughts the best (smile). Guess what form Another has his wealth in as all this plays out?

Also:

MK, there are few places on the internet (if any) that advocate physical metal investment as your company does. The investing universe is choked with brokers and such pushing 95% paper gold and 5% (or less) physical. By not offering any insight as to how that position could backfire on the
vast majority of people, they create a one sided illusion of the future. Your site and company does a tremendous service for the public. People are not just buying gold from your operation, they are buying a "physical understanding" about metal doing it from a team of professionals that won't run
away when the going gets tough! With that comes the strength for one to hold strong.

Anyone dealing with CPM will profit far more in the future from their purchase, than you will profit from the sale today. If your promotion places more gold in the hands of people, then miners, savers and the entire gold industry benefit from it.

Don't mind us, there is plenty to follow and talk about and lots of room here to do it in. We will fit our discussion above, below and on both sides of your offerings.

Thank you for all your efforts

Comment

Hello ALL:

I'll have some replies / comments soom. Just not yet.

I've been closely following (involved) the progress of the new iX pan European market. What a convoluted thing this is turning into. It still looks good and will ultimately transform the world stock trading arenas. Especially in that it will further along London's move into the Euro Zone sphere. We follow this very closely because once this Britain Euro link passes the (mental / political) half way
mark of no return, it will also start a frenzied rush away from dollar based gold trading. Actually it will only make clear to many what has been in progress for some time. Stranding anyone, including governments, power brokers and the like into holding depreciating gold paper. This is all part of an extremely broad based transition from a dollar world. So, this is where my energy has been focused these many weeks.

BTD, I was wanting someone to present a position such as yours so everyone could follow it. In fact, I'll place your position way up on a "pedestal" "for all to see" (SMILE).
Here's what I did:

I'm not too different from that fella Armstrong. You know, the one in trouble for being a big gold bear while he in fact had a lot of bullion himself! I think he kept in a hall way closet. Well, I'm not a bear on Physical gold, but am very bearish on paper gold. Who knows, maybe he was just acting out the very same premise myself and a few fellow banks are also doing? In fact now, today, is going to prove a very good time frame for this little exercise.

So, after reading BTD's post I decided "not" to think for myself, but just follow his lead (smile)! I got up, went down my hall way and opened up the closet. Oh lord, I forgot how many Krugerrands were piled up behind that door! After opening it, they all slid out and just covered me up so as to almost crush me (huge smile). Three hours later, after digging out from under it all, I counted out 300 K rands, just as BTD did.

Then I went down and sold them for $270 each (a rough fair, average price in today's market). Then I placed $81,000 in T-bills and placed these in a margin account. Then brought 3 - 100 ounce comex futures contracts. Boy this is fun after all! I purchased the Dec 2000s at $383.30. So, come Dec. I can pay #383.30 in full and have 300 ounces of gold. All the while earning some interest.

Now, I don't know how long some of you have been around this market, but it seems we all learn a little something every now and again. But, any of you trading futures know just how hard it is to beat the "priced in interest" of a forward paper position. Much less beat out a full paid up physical
holding ounce for ounce. Ha! Ha! I remember when there was no gold futures and how exciting the prospect was to have one. Some old dude, huh?

Anyway, my brand new BTD trade is up and running and I'm counting on him to update and guide me (us) on his success. Oh, rest assured, I'll keep my trade "on the table" until this all play's out! In fact, it's going to be posted on a "trail marker" on the gold trail. Just in case some lose their way.

Also:

BTDs post #31098 said:

------ I enjoy this forum and all the theories posited here, but I thought a variant opinion might be useful.-------

BTD, your position (opinion) is not in any way "variant" from typical Western thought. I bet 99% of the gold bugs employ your strategy, mostly in a much more leveraged form. What is "variant" here is our "new" future view of gold in the political world.

You say:

---------and many will probably assure me that the world is coming to an end (per FOA/Trail Guide) and that paper gold will be driven into the ground while physical gold skyrockets. -----

My friend, it would only be the end of the world for paper gold traders. Indeed, if comex stays intact, I bet my physical will match your contracts ounce for ounce (smile). Something that cannot be said for a reverse situation I see coming. You see, our position is leveraged for a worse case,
while yours can only keep up with mine in your good case!

Of course, you could employ major leverage in the futures and gold shares and take the same major percentage paper hit such a position has had over the last few years. But then, we would never hear of it, would we. It seems the whole internet is full of gold stock owners (and future traders) that never lost money over the last 10 years, but suddenly brought their position "at the stock lows" recently (frown). My record is very clear and "unchanging" I might add. I have been buying physical gold all the way down from $360 through $280 and continue to do so. Indeed, a very large bulk of that was taken last year (around the spring) at $283+/-. I made several posts then as to why a combination of good supply (for large traders) and the $280 price for delivered
physical made it an opportune time. Nothing has changed that position. Also, please check the rest of my posts to see that gold is not my only holding.

You say:

------Trail Guide is a very articulate and thoughtful commentator, but his ideas are just theories like everyone else's.---------------------------

Well, my friend, I know you trade on facts alone. Your riches prove that, right (smile). For myself, I agree, theories are like "mouths", everyone's got one! Problem is, I never got anywhere investing in what others said. My position comes from following what a few people are "doing". The question is "do they know what they are doing?" Oh, they better! Because your wealth and lifestyle depend on it! Whether you know what you're doing or not!

Trail Marker #1

Hello everyone.

I'm placing a marker on the trail today so everyone can see our path more clearly. Please read my post on USAGOLD: Trail Guide (5/24/2000; 7:33:47MT - usagold.com msg#: 31148). I'm calling it the BTD Marker.

No, I'm not becoming a futures trader. Rather it's done as a real life response to a post (#31098) made by BTD where he presented his case that holding 300 ounces as futures was just as good as holding 300 physical ounces. Far to many newcomers arrive at the decision to own physical gold only to be taken in with the paper song of futures brokers. Usually it is given in the context that:

"Your physical is just laying there doing nothing, so why not trade it. Better yet you can even earn interest to boot!"

More often than not, fresh gold investors end up losing a ton of their wealth before getting an "education" that leveraged paper gold is not real gold. Therefore, I will hold and even roll over several times my 3 - 100 ounce futures in an effort to compare it's return to holding physical gold. Anyone that is tempted to "unload" their real gold to follow the leveraged game can watch my money first. I sold 300 K-rands at $270, netted out $81,000 and brought (6 month) T-bills. Placed them in a margin account and brought 3 Dec futures at $283.30 (I mis typed this as 383 in my post, but most of you would have known this).

After a period of time (even a few rollovers) we will see if we can buy back those same 300 K-rands for even money. I'm now betting that the season is close enough that the two positions will part ways. For all of you that have been walking this gold trail, you already understand how paper gold is the tool being employed today to destroy the dollar gold market. It is very possible we will see the effects of this during our exercise as the value of futures is discounted well below the physical gold price. I'll be sure to update my new holdings for anyone that does not chart this trade themselves.

In all fairness I wanted (asked) BTD to track his "Publicly stated position" so as to articulate his gains or losses for new followers. He declined for personal reasons in #31154.

Onward

The perception gained by following a losing position in paper gold comes in seeing the different mentality inherent in the gold market today. As I presented many times before, their game is to play the "price" of gold in a paper leveraged way. It's an old failing tool that is compounding loses as the years go by. In no way can they understand the massive leverage in holding gold itself against the coming discounting of the paper industry. From my post:
------"My friend, it would only be the end of the world for paper gold traders. Indeed, if comex stays intact, I bet my physical will match your contracts ounce for ounce (smile). Something that cannot be said for a reverse situation I see coming. You see, our position is leveraged for a worse case, while yours can only keep up with mine in your good case!"------
Immediately after I presented my "trade", futures brokers jumped in to council and precondition my comparison. As if to outline how it had to be done. Well, I have brought and sold paper from every position you can guess. Up, down, sideways and in reverse! Most of you have also. Having to listen to them backtrack and explain to me how futures are meant to be traded and are a short term investment and how it should be done,,,,,,,, it's like having our just grown up children return for a visit and listen as they "educate us" on politics, human interaction and sex! I can only quietly think "you're kidding", "I didn't know that" "wow, didn't know things worked that way" (smile).

My friends, they are a fine example of this new generation of "Western Thinking" when it comes to gold. Read all of the 05/24/00 USAGOLD for some background. No matter how many thousands of words are written to identify the different impact that Physical gold and paper gold have on the market place they promote a paper investment as the saving factor that will drive the price higher.

The very forces that Chris Powell and Bill Murphy of GATA are fighting against are using these "mindsets" as the tool to control gold. The vast majority of traders "buy into" the concept that paper gold is real gold, all the while placing real investment money against the opposite side of a cash trade. In the process freeing rare physical to satisfy the established contracts of a loan / leasing game.

Further we walk

The Washington agreement formed the ground work that will eventually destroy all of our dollar based paper gold contracts. Yes, PH in LA we are still "on the road" to high priced gold. Today, selling paper gold is almost free money to the banking industry! No one opposes the complete unbridled selling of gold contracts because so few want delivery. More and more, real gold is being channeled outside the contract arena. It has become so obviously clear it should appear as a blinding light to anyone that looks. Trading on established paper exchanges will dry until they fail.

On the US side, we continue to write gold derivatives to keep the "followed" price down for the dollar's sake.

On the Euro side, they write gold derivatives because it further dilutes, discredits and eventually destroys the dollar's gold market.

From the BIS perspective, "noone" cares what the paper price of gold goes to now because the acceptance of paper gold has been replaced with "real gold flow" as the regulator of dollar oil prices. With a "full on" cash settlement of outstanding paper contracts on the horizon, Euro paper will best out dollar paper, but no one is stupid enough to be covering paper with real gold. Well, perhaps a few are.

The view

This is the landscape from where GATA is trying to pressure a return to "fair trading" of paper gold. My friends, it's not going to change back for the better and the industry doesn't expect it to. In the words of Goldfinger in a 007 film: "I expect you to die Mr. Bond!"

This failing system is also one of the same investing vehicle so many futures brokers push! Brokers present all these leveraged items as a good way to "play" the price of gold. At the same time my friends are selling, creating, writing and unloading all the paper derivatives the world can handle. Indeed, they will keep doing it as long as the market has money to give away by not discounting these derivatives against physical gold. It's free money from paper gold investors!

We rest

No, we gold bugs are not all on the same side! Many think I don't like paper gold just because it's not physical. They say there is no precedent for a large scale devaluation of all paper gold. One has only to see the perception just prior to 1971 when the dollar was discounted against gold. That discount, unlawful as it was will in every way compare to the coming discredit of all paper gold. One day you will have a gold contract, the next it will be a currency contract. Marked to the market, the currency price to settle this crisis will not even compare to the coming "free gold"
trading price.

Perhaps we will see the beginnings of this while I hold my 3 futures. I expect our resident paper pushers to jockey and squabble all the while this unfolds.

Back to the city.

Sir Guide...Apples to apples I do repeat...
You can say you sold your Krands for $270.00 (a fair value?)
for the day...Is that ALL you could get?...I read your post yest. in response to BTD, but to be
FAIR, the "local price" from the vault was "$282.00 per coin" as I checked with CPM Inc. right
after the store started for the day...
Here in lies the Small problem...You could only "get" $270 but a comparison "purchase" costs $282...
Is it not more truthful to have "bought both" yesterday AM.and see how the dust settles in the
future on a total equity worth basis? I offered Dec1 as a practical window of time...
Once again, The "buy" price of our physical contrasted with the "buy" price of our futures will give a fair and honest comparison of the two (in my opinion, related)"investments.
You try and stack the deck in your favor by using the "sell price" of $270...and then using this as your "basis"...That isn't right for this comparison...

Hello Goldhunter

I read you the first time. Understand, I'm not doing this for your benefit nor do I follow your rules. This is a real life demonstration done in a simple "rounded out fashion" "by me" and for the benefit of the average investor watching. Most of these people (thousands I believe) read my talks while they are using a good helping of their common sense. They know how to read between the lines and figure things for themselves. As an example I believe all of them knew that Dec futures didn't close at $383 as I mis typed yesterday. They can also read my extremely poor English usage (smile).

BTD didn't offer any physical sell price or future buy price in his post. That's why I wanted to mark my trade close to the market for all to see. Your quibbling about my price to sell these K-rands is small change to me and even smaller to these readers who are looking for a big picture. I know
they will not accept if someone nickel and dimes a trade to prove a point. Truly, if my exercise doesn't completely overwhelm your difference, I'll present it as a paper win.

Also:

This whole exchange was never an effort to pick on BTD or fault his physical position change into futures. As I said, using leverage is how most Westerners play the game. The problem is the concept always falls out of context because everyone touts a trade but never fully follows up with a
general outline of their position. Or when they leave it. Everyone here has some perception of my capacity to own gold and general entry points. By simple extension the average thinker knows I'm huge, big time, "world class down" in dollar terms. Yet, I am comfortable because I understand it's future and proclaim where we are all going with it. Gold is a "percentage of my wealth" savings to me, not a trade. I will see out distance every other investment in time.

Yourself Goldhunter is a good example. You declare to hold Eagles and trade futures. You also commented in your above post to me about being truthful, fair and honest. How about giving these people a position that lasts longer than a few months? If you make a living as a futures broker and trading is where it's at, take us on a hike (smile)?

thanks

Hello Leigh and welcome also "aircrew"!

Thanks Leigh, for pointing out those past discussions. Yes, a rounded coin holding is very good for most people, myself included. The old world coins may do very well if they are frozen out of the trading marketplace because of their art appeal and non- Legal Tender status. I even thought of
comparing Stranger's NEM against the performance of the 20 Marks, MK offered. But I am unsure of my personal outcome. You see, if the 20 Marks beat out NEM, Stranger will come after me with an "AX". But, if NEM wins, he will try to hug me! I'll be in a bad position either way (big smile)!

PH and ORO, just a minute.

BTD, TC, TG, Solomon - gold and paper The paper markets provide an investor with a means to play the price of gold. They do not reflect directly the availability of gold, just the availability of paper obligations denominated in gold.
---------------------

Your part above brought me back to a subject I only touched on before. When all the gold loans were a big rage a year ot two ago, no one really bothered to confirm if the loan money the mines got really came from "sold gold". The media and Bullion houses said it was, but was it? The price said it was, but did the price fall from physical selling or was it just some physical and mostly paper derivatives?

You know, the original typical unconvoluted mine loan. The BB borrows gold, sells it and they and the mine control the account where the money from the sale is placed. Some people think the BB just gives the mine the money for it's own use, but then the mine would owe the BB both cash and gold bars. No, the mine owes the BB only gold bars. They usually jointly invest the cash from the gold loan sale until it's used to buy the newly mined gold that's returned to the lender.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the mines don't hold any confirming documents that absolutely state that a real physical gold sale produced the cash collateral. Could you imagine a miner demanding such a document as a condition for a gold loan (smile). I think someone should check into this!
No?

You see, this cash could come from someone's account, a loan, official entity or official government source? I bet some of this money wanted to actually receive gold for the cash (oil?). But most of it just wanted to stimulate (expand) the paper gold supply. From this view the gold
loan isn't the rainman, is it? The profit for the banks comes from selling the derivatives to create a channel for new mined gold. As the price falls, the derivatives grow fat.

The gold loan cash doesn't have to be generated by real gold moved from a vault and sold. Even though a CB is involved as backup. Once this cash is introduced into the deal as collateral, the BB is obligated to cover his position if the mined gold is not wanted. Not by going long gold derivatives, rather by selling gold short. All in an effort to create an avenue to send the gold down if the gold loan ever starts paying down instead of rolling over.

During this time, the more funds available from investors or fractional reserve banking, the more gold paper is sold, the lower the lease rate, the more paper gold is expanded. Why, almost anyone could borrow gold cash in this fashion. For someone wanting paper gold to fall, it was like "money
in the bank". I don't think there is much lending against the lease rate now as rates reflect a diminished market. But who needs it? Everyone has learned to just sell the derivatives outright. This won't last much longer.

I bet if someone went to a willing mine, they could find gold. Not in the shaft, on the books!

Just thinking out loud.

Again, back to: ORO (5/25/2000; 6:21:15MT - usagold.com msg#: 31228)

ORO,
You could have not presented this any better than your full post has done. I wanted to note your item:

-----The price of gold in these markets is the value of a fiduciary gold. The only mechanism for the connection of the gold price to its supply and demand fundamentals is arbitrage. ---------

Yes, and if that process is blocked by an ever falling price? Or better asked, who delivers bullion against a short contract if the contract can be sold at a profit? Arbitrage doesn't happen in these one way paper markets. The contract is covered in a cash close and the bullion is sold on the open spot. Further driving the price. As a percentage of the whole traded paper gold market place, very little is delivered against contracts. If you sell a tonn to a dealer, sure he hedges, but he mostly covers those contracts in cash. Right?

My point, that coattails your post, is that the existing gold market as we know it is already mostly in "cash settlement". In a gold crisis, physical could easily be withdrawn from what little arbitrage exists. The lost profit potential from suspect payment in a delivery against contracts becomes the "premium" on "barrel head gold". Or reversed, the contracts trade at a discount.

We are so close to lighting the fuse on this, I can almost feel it.

World gold derivatives positions are exploding as authorities turn away. There is truly nothing left to
protect. Without arbitrage it's a full on cash game.

The Euro is incredibly strong considering the interest rate difference with little or no price inflation comparison. The ECB has just held tough. I've said it before and will say again; can you imagine what the Euro would do if they raised rates close to ours? Just look at the ongoing London / Euro
iX plans. How long do you think Europe would take to reestablish a gold market in Euros once England makes the dive? Certainly, LBMA is going to lose a few big members as this winds down.

Your "fiduciary gold" risk is building daily as the "risk" to paper is truly in cash settlement and currency transition. Not to mention the "walking dead" from the WA bomb.

Then there is oil! OH boy! Everyone talks like this political price range will save us. But, the jockeying for position in an alternative Euro must surely be complete. Once the gold flow slows, the oil price will surge. That will break the dollar and the ECB will be cutting rates to stop the Euro from also surging. Next step, a jump to basket or full Euro oil pricing!

Yes, the leverage against the explosion and demise of derivatives is only in physical gold. What an incredible event this is going to be!

Thanks

Hello Goldhunter

In your corrected post #: 31355 you say:

------------ 18,500 100oz lots...1,850,518 total ozs.. of the REAL STUFF too...--------

I ask, so what? You see, we all have been talking about comex gold for a year or so. The present fact that 1,850,518 ounces is laying in their vault, but owned by others doesn't do comex any good if someone wants to call for delivery. Right? You know, I know , we all know that this "Real Stuff"
has no play to make credible my (3) or others outstanding "longs" unless the owners of that "real stuff", who are not "the comex operation", wish to sell it. TownCrier has written on and followed this for several months. This is old refuted news, my friend.

You say:

-------The largest commercial producers and consumers of commodities use these exchanges for price discovery, price protection (hedging long & short), and speculation for profits...------------

Yes, this is good, but just because one of these "players" have placed some cash down and taken the other side of my (3) or others contracts in no way secures any gold to honor delivery. Right?

In fact the entire total comex outstanding contracts mostly represents "margin" money on both sides of the contracts. Look at me? I'm new long and have only T-bills as 100% margin. 99% of the short players do not trade like me. They place appx. $2,000 +/- a thousand and go short! Do they have
"uncommitted gold" to deliver? Usually not! The bulk of commercials only hold the paper version as a hedge against wholesale and retail operations. If they suddenly were called to deliver, they would have to buy outright most of the gold. That's because their customers would demand them to cover their deals too. Tell me have you done much international / commercial gold trading? I mostly
just watch (smile).

Is this what you call "gold on the ready" to be delivered from comex? NO? I'm glad you agree, because no one here accepts that perception anyway.

Also: Comex is but a tiny fraction of paper gold traded around the world. But you knew that too. (smile)

"paper gold, it's just for fun"

"physical gold, it ain't for trading any more"

When are you going to take us for a futures hike?

thanks

--------Would such a mining company restrict the amount of gold it placed on the market as mine.com seems to infer? ----------------

A Great Hello to you USAGOLD!

You have to admit it would be an interesting development for the bullion markets if a large sector even "Thought" about redirecting supply. Almost like channeling gold away from the contract markets? (smile)

You know, that Golffields might be a good one to hold through "thick and thin" no matter what it's share price goes to? Oh, but if only investors would learn to reverse the "accepted" rules and place 90% of their hard money wealth in real gold and 10% in "the best gold companies". Then one could lean back and watch it all "play out" these next few months. No matter what happens.

I'll be back later. Hope you (and every American) is having a fine Memorial day.

Hello again Michael,

--------USAGOLD (5/28/2000; 10:50:58MT - usagold.com msg#: 31446)
Greetings, Trail Guide. . .Let me Ramble a bit....as we slowly hike the crosscut--------

Yes,
I enjoy it when you "ramble on a bit" as in #31446 today. That post covered a lot of ground! While we are on that crosscut:

I think that between Reg Howe and ORO, the ghostly fog is being removed from our gold markets. If they keep going this way, eventually, the whole world will see what kind black hole it is. These are the same asset-less securities they are buying into by trading (investing) in paper gold. This entire gold derivatives book has been one of the most "unseen", "least understood" paradigm to come along in some time. Most people little more grasp what our current gold arena is than they grasp what that dollar is in their pocket!

I sit down the other day and spent a lot of time writing a very long post to take the next step. But, it became too blunt and outright. After some thought and discussion I withdrew with a firm conviction that this venue is still the right track. No matter how slow, events are unwinding as
others are understanding the gold evolution. Yes, and doing it on their own. Here is the first beginnings of that hike, presented as a backdrop to your post today:

--------
At camp:
Our gold market is in "evolution" not just suffering from the same bear effects old gold bugs promote and have documented from the past? If you agree that it's only a bear market and that it will reverse soon, you're in for a big surprise. The paper gold market you know, trade and love is
about to end.

Onward
Central Banks have leased / lent some gold for a number of years and for no more than a tiny return. Even Alan Greenspan pointed out their willingness to do so. But the majority of that "real" gold never made it onto the "melt down" market as the media portrays. Early on (years ago) most of it was transferred to other Euro friendly CBs while setting a lending precedent for the Bullion Banks. We have made this point over and over and the ongoing CB figures prove it out. Further, what portion of this additional gold supply that went outside the BIS system of CBs, mostly ended
up in real accounts under other names. Yes, these bullion bars are still alive and well. Representing the real wealth of someone, somewhere!

Many try to build a position that this CB gold is gone, melted and will never return to their vaults. Well, it wasn't lend it out for next to nothing so they could count on it's return at today's values! Again, most of it is still in the BIS system waiting for revaluation once our current dollar market fails. The fact that virtually no one can name the physical buyers of all these deals calls into question the often stated premise that CB gold has been melted down for industry use. It wasn't!

----------------

Michael,
Truly, the whole purpose for starting the Western paper gold markets with initial lent gold was so they (BIS / ECB) could eventually destroy our dollar gold market. But the dollar faction (USA) played this game because they never believed the Euro Bomb could be set off. It's that simple. This
joint play was made on the "Western" weakness to own paper gold substitutes. American dollar backers thought this was just fine. Yes, the more these paper markets could be diluted with supply the lower the paper price would go as the dollar looked ever better. That in turn convinced ever more "old" "long term" bullion holders to give up their metal and hold leveraged positions that required less cash. Using gold stock options, gold stocks, futures options and futures themselves, investors began a long term trend of off loading bullion onto the market. Even sophisticated
investors used "unallocated" bullion accounts that contained only a delivery commitment and no gold itself.

This new "mind set" was, years ago, read perfectly by the political system! Nothing else could identify this trend better than right after the WA announcement. You noted how:

----" " This is when management clamped down in some of the bullion banks, people fired, changes made. Of course that's when the word went out that an investor could sell calls but they would have to be taken in "at market" -- which of course left holders at the mercy of the players. --------

But what happened next? The whole market returned to trading the questioned paper! In the old days it would have been over with. No, they set the hook deeply and have the modern day gold bugs doing their political bidding for them. With every drop in the paper game, players double up to catch up. All the while leaving the real leveraged instrument, physical gold to be ever more acquired by those who understand the dollars current position. Truly, I am not expanding the perception too far when I say, "they don't plan on ever selling again for dollars".

Our recent "TOCOM style default" is absolutely nothing to what is before us!

-------------------------------------

Nuts! MK, I have to quickly go. Will pick this up in early AM and finish.

Thanks

Trail Guide (5/29/2000; 8:28:27MT - usagold.com msg#: 31482)
To continue on from my #31469

Our recent "TOCOM style default" is absolutely nothing to what is before us! One has but to read through the internet and see what is only a small fraction of dedicated Western gold bugs playing this paper game. To the last man (and woman), they all perceive the paper tools they work with
has gold on the other side of it. If not that, they firmly believe the human and his wealth on the other side of that trade can be forced to eventually settle in gold. Further, if not gold, then settle in a fashion that deliveries the same "close out" value as the then "currently trading dealer physical".

In reality, all these players (uptick included) are only working within a limited pool of cash margin account wealth. Deposited worldwide, this small pool is the limited wealth that creates the gold perception behind paper contracts. As long as the ebb and flow of gold trading does not leave the
limits of this pool's wealth boundaries, a small fraction of physical can be delivered against it. Giving the entire paper arena credibility. Under these conditions, traders can settle 90%+ in cash, confident that the 10% (or less) of visible physical delivery is available to them if desired.

Once gold values move quickly beyond this margin zone, all is lost. The comming gold moves, we know are coming will dwarf anything seen in the past. Indeed, most think it's impossible for gold to move this much in a genneration.

Without knowing it, the banks and gold brokering industry have built a paper system that has grown in line with American political motivations. Using only a fraction of the money necessary to margin paper gold 100% (mark to the market), our current arena grew into a huge derivative gold
game that dwarfs the real physical gold world. No matter how it's compared; be it to total gold held in the world or the possible real gold supply offered at any particular dollar price, physical gold would need be priced in the many thousands to equal even a portion of our current paper
market holdings. Truly, we could lose two thirds the paper contracts and $5,000 gold would not cover the rest. It's that far out of line!

Obviously, once this system passed certain limits, years ago there was no turning back. Today, world gold could never honor the paper that's out there. At any dollar price! Not even close! Once understood, as it is being understood now, a person blind in one eye could see that this required political backing to build it. There was simply no way anything on an international scale this big could have developed without behind the curtains political support.

This decades long trend was developed as a way to placate "non Western" dollar system supporters. True to life, oil producers and Europeans wanted the dollar to work just as much as anyone. Michael, you have followed this evolution for a long time and know that none of us wanted the American reserve system to fail. I think the big philosophical difference between most of the world and Europe / Oil was that non Americans only wanted cheap gold to legitimize continued dollar use. Americans didn't because the dollar was our internal currency. Our gold value was in the exporting of dollars for real goods, plain and simple. Few US citizens grasp that this business of getting real goods internationally, on this scale, for only an IOU is a new "untested" concept. It's only been around from the late 60s. It's scale only came close to these levels in the 90s.

Today, this dollar IOU system has grown to a size that is completely not measurable. It is to this end that one has to credit these physical gold advocate countries for seeing the future. Right on schedule, the Western dollar supporters built a debt load that could never be covered in real
production. In balance with this debt, they also built a gold debt that is uncoverable. It is at this point that the dollar begins the death march so many expected years ago. The end of our ability to create dollar debt was / is not the end sign. The true end sign is found today. It will be in the failure of our ability to sell paper gold debt on par with physical. This will kill it.

Truly, the Washington Agreement was not about the end of making of all paper gold. I mentioned earlier how it made no provisions to cover or reduce Western held dollar derivatives, but did controll physical flows by using the BIS. The WA is about decoupling the joint political drive to
support low dollar gold prices with Euro Zone CB gold trades. With dollar based derivatives all being seen as eventually thrown in the same default pot, no one is worried about supplying gold to cover them. If the dollar is going to hyper inflate, and it's gold paper is going to default worldwide then writing (shorting) dollar gold paper is free money to anyone that want's it! Euro Zone based
derivatives will be supported through limited gold delivery or with Euro cash. Both will be seen as a mountain of credibility in the storm that is coming. Let's face it, if you held a Euro gold contract for 100 ounces and only ten ounces plus Euro cash are delivered, that settlement will be worth a fortune in today's terms compared to a hyper dollar world.

What is amazing is how so much of this gold debt is held in lieu of bullion by Western investors, both large and small. These last few years, Americans have downloaded their bullion holdings worldwide. This trend is encouraged by industry players. Every paper gold broker that walks and
talks has to believe in the credibility of his domain. His income depends on it! This same confidence travels through the community of brokers / investors until they all support the arena. In the end, once paper gold begins it's discount against physical open interest and trading will fall away. Then every dedicated gold analysts will claim to have understood it all and pointed to this long ago. Leaving the poor gold investor wondering what happened. Oh, there will be a huge spike right at the crisis time as OI surges from panic, but the shut down will happen equally fast and deny exit to almost everyone.

Michael, you commented:

--------Isn't it interesting, TG, that all these mega stock mutual funds (Janus, comes to mind), hedge funds (Quantum, Tiger, come to mind) and trading firms (John Henry) are having to close down or trim operations for essentially the same reason -- because they can no longer find anyone
to peddle their positions to? Big enough to buy everything in site; but too big to find a buyer. These markets do eventually take care of themselves don't they? This is by far the most important development in the investment markets with huge social, economic and political repercussions and
nobody is talking about it.

Now we will have a splintering over the coming months into smaller entities, competitions should be renewed. I think this is healthy for the investment business, but the current "paradigm" will likely suffer. The warning is very clear to those who read the signs. In fact, the process has begun. As I say, the markets do eventually take care of themselves.--------------------

Boy, they sure do MK! All of this is a function of the larger picture, not just the gold markets. Our dollar world and it's markets are changing and we as "locked in citizens" of that world must adjust to what is coming. It's not the end of the world, as so many say our position represents. We only hear that from those that will lose a lifestyle built on everything remaining "as is". A large sector of
American life will adjust to a more realistic level of existence. As in all things past and present, some will do better than others. The "better doers" will see and plan for this change.

More from you"

------A thought that occurred to me recently is that these gold derivative position might have been funneled to Morgan and Deutsch to make it politically possible for a bailout to occur (via the "Too Big To Fail" Docrine) -- that bailout would be on paper products of course, but that could gun the
price as they buy back their positions. In the end though, they will be left as we all know with some huge gold loans to pay at inflated prices -- their worst nightmare will have come to life.----------

I agree MK and that would be the best outcome for paper gold traders. But it would "only gun" the paper price while the physical price would literally skyrocket! The outcome would still be a huge discount of contract value against physical (1% of physical price). Much more than in a total paper
default where what could trade would be perhaps 20% of physical value. We shall soon see (smile).

Also, you say:

--------As for the GoldFields and FrancoNevada, I would like to know what they are thinking. (??) (One thing that comes to mind is that I have had some clever mining people tell me that the best gold is not what you are bringing up now, but what you will bring up in the future. Consider that one!) I do not think the two have enough metal to affect the price by keeping production out of the market. So I think that minesite.com might be overly optimistic there. Besides these are companies not countries. It would be a different story if South Africa were to cartellize and restrict production with Australia, or some such thing, but two companies representing less than 200 tons of production annually won't have anything but a short term effect. How much of that 200 would they be willing to take off the market? They do have bills to pay.

I think they have something else in mind -- like a company with enough capitalization to attract big time mutual fund money. I don't know. Just guessing. I'll be watching with interest along with everyone else.--------------

MK, I think they are trying to position themselves to start a trend others will follow. After reading all of the above we can understand that in the coming situation, it won't take much supply removal to control the physical markets. In the context of our reasoning, certifying that gold is not used to cover contracts would break the bank, literally! Forcing industrial buyers to use gold and not trade it does more than we think in today's super leveraged arena. Only a few will be able to do this (smile).

Finally, about your last words:

-------Gold itself is less ambiguous. Any gold investor entering the gold stock arena should understand that stocks are not really a proxy for gold itself, and resist the temptation to load up because you think gold is going to explode and these stocks are going to rise ten times faster than gold, etc --especially the so-called juniors. We have seen where that type of thinking can land you. Thereseems to be always something unforeseen. My advice would be to take a measured approach'stick with the blue chips, and don't take a position that's going to keep you up at night worrying. -----

Absolutely! When looking back several years at Another's Thoughts and his council to own physical, I see where so much paper value was destroyed right in the hands of modern gold bugs. Most paper gold vehicles are a small amount, if not a fraction of their value then. Even though the
political game evolved differently from his perception then and the great paper burn hasn't happened yet, placing 90% of one's hard assets in paper gold and 10% in physical yielded a disaster. All of the great gold bugs touted their followers right into a failure, then retreated to a stance that said "oh, but you were to have traded it, not hold it"! Their direction was flawed then and will be again for anyone that listens now. For this evolving market, and to counter the dollar failure to come, a position of 90% physical and 10% paper is for both Giants and Dwarfs. I'll hold that for the duration and come out well ahead following their footsteps.

And you close:

--------Enough of my rambling, trusted Guide. Speaking of unforeseen, have you seen any bears on this mountainside lately? What are your thoughts this fine Sunday morning?-----

Michael, this whole unfolding event is going to be an experience to behold and discuss. In convoluted form, our gold markets will begin to lose credibility and disintegrate. All the while as our American economic engine breaks down. Truly, the end of an era as the "American Experience wanes".

As for bears, it time we pause so I may put on my running shoes. You didn't bring yours? Them, my good man, I hope you can out run that bear behind us, because I am certainly going to outrun you (huge smile)!

Aragorn III, it's my turn now! (smile)
Hello Goldhunter,

I'm glad you read and commented on my post to you. It opened more ground for discussion.

You say:

--------goldhunter (05/29/00; 13:07:27MT - usagold.com msg#: 31494) For FOA's Friday post #31367, He can get physical gold from his contracts (our example we're visiting about) he simply needs to remain "long" into delivery period (the short determines the exact date) and FOA's broker will notify him when his account has "stopped" 3 100 oz. contracts of gold...he'll pay a couple very minor charges and instruct BRINKS where to deliver his physical gold to him...It happens just like this all the time for those that want delivery.-------

This is very good Mr. Hunter and sounds just like their printed literature. It describes the mechanics of a small trade such as in our BTD example, but by extension your reply about the delivery process is out of context. It does nothing to address how this market could fulfill a delivery demand "in mass" and the risk that entails.

In my post to you #3167 I pointed out:

-------we all know that this "Real Stuff" (gold in approved warehouses) has no play to make credible my (3) or others outstanding "longs" unless the owners of that "real stuff", who are not "the comex operation", wish to sell it.--------

-------just because one of these "players" (The largest commercial producers and consumers of commodities) have placed some cash down and taken the other side of my (3) or others contracts in no way secures any gold to honor delivery. Right?-----------

--------In fact the entire total comex outstanding contracts mostly represents "margin" money on both sides of the contracts. ------

-------Do they have "uncommitted gold" to deliver? Usually not! The bulk of commercials only hold the paper version as a hedge against wholesale and retail operations. If they suddenly were called to deliver, they would have to buy outright most of the gold. That's because their customers
would demand them to cover their deals too-----------

In effect, a large demand delivery would be meat with the same official reaction that recently happened with "TOCOM" or further back with the Bunker Hunt scandal. There is no possible way paper futures today could retain credibility in the face of serious delivery demands. For a demand of three contracts such as mine or in amounts less than 10% of outstanding Open interest, the markets work. In a serious crisis, it does not.

Further you say:

----The reason there is not "more delivery" is that the leveraged traders (not FOA or BTD: They paid up in full) so out perform physical buyers (IN A RISING MARKET) that fewer traders pay in full and simply post $1000 or $2000 margin for a futures contract. -----------

Mr. Hunter, the reverse of this statement is more in line with today's realities. Let's try it my way:

" " the reason there is not "more delivery" is that the leveraged traders so "UNDER" perform physical buyers (IN A " " FALLING " " MARKET) that fewer traders pay in full and simply post $1000 or $2000 margin for a futures contract." "

That truly does a much better job of presenting the feelings of modern paper gold traders, no? In fact, many on the net can relate to having started with enough cash to buy 100 ounces of physical at say $400/oz. But after dropping margin after margin over several years they lost the entire
$40,000! Compare that to the awful realities of someone that still has $27,000 in 100 coins today and retains the physical option of still being "IN THE GAME"! Even here I do not nickel and dime the thoughts of readers by using $360 as the entry point. (smile)

Further, your words:

----A futures trader may be content to "control" the gold and profit from a price rise, However, A "long futures" holder can receive physical if they choose...The gold is there (in Comex approved storage) exactly for this purpose.------

Tell me sir, if I placed $20,000 down and shorted (sold) ten 100 ounce contracts,,,,,, and had no gold of my own to back up my bet,,,,,, and I failed,,,,, Exactly how does Comex go about extracting 1,000 ounces from others accounts to make good on my bet? Do they buy it? Or do they just take it? Or do they keep a buffer of several thousand ounces to cover failed traders? It seems to me that in the event of a crisis, "noone" that owns all that gold in approved storage might want to sell it? I guess this begs the question, if all that gold is owned, what good does it do in making credible excess, outstanding contracts? Those above and beyond "eligible" holdings sold outright. You know, the ones that far and beyond represent gold, as you say! But only have margin cash behind them. (smile)

Also:

I really did sell those coins for $270 and it was not through CMP. Can't help if the price wasn't higher. In addition I brought the (3) contracts for $283.30.

Again my example is not designed to represent what a "broker" or I consider fair. It represents what happens in a "real life" context. The kind of experience an average person would encounter. I'm showing (among other things to be presented as this unfolds) why it will be a very bad trade to sell paid up coins to pursue a paper trail. Again, as I said before, ten or twenty bucks per ounce will not mean a thing, later.

Thank you for continuing this eye-opening discussion. It is my sincere hope that everyone will follow along.

Hello again Goldhunter!
If we are to discuss this issue, each of us must attempt to address all (or most) of our replies in a somewhat point / counter point fashion. I am trying to do this with your posts. Otherwise readers never can grasp our position in it's presented context.

You say in #31520:

---------FOA, In your example: 10 contracts on $20,000 margin (short)... If you are on the wrong side, price rising against you, you have two choices, post additional margin funds, or, your brokerage firm will liquidate (buy) your short position in a timely manner...you will be out of the
trade, lighter in cash, but no liability to deliver gold.-------------

Mr. Hunter,

My example was not in the trading context. The thrust of the argument was that of a short investor being called at this point. If the price had been static (not moved enough to warrant much more margin money), as recently has been the case and my short position ran to the end. Assume I did
not make any motion until someone "stopped" my position with a delivery intent. I then stand firm with no more money or gold to apply.

My point and example goes to the inability of Comex to supply gold to cover my short position and attacks your use of their warehouse stocks as a "symbol of security" for investors.. They (Comex) must "buy new gold" to cover me in order to make the "stopping" long position whole (Note to all: that's the guy on the other side of my trade). Whether they buy gold from existing approved warehouse stocks or go into the open market, they do not have "standing supplied" to draw from without expending "their (comex) capital" to do so. In the event of a "fast market", many such short
failures leverage any gold price increases against comex capital.

My friend, please address this in your discussion. My argument has challenged you to defend your position. I present that approved comex warehouse gold is nothing more than "investor owned" metal and would require the expending of comex cash to deploy that stored metal, or any metal to
cover my default.

Further and extending this:

In a crisis, with enough demands on their resources, many positions such as my 1,000 ounce example would completely overwhelm and shut down their operation. Because they could not secure enough physical gold to buy and / or they do not have the resources to do so. (please address this by point so we may proceed). (smile)

Mr. Goldhunter.
Thanks for your many replies. No, you are certainly not the / a bad guy here. We are discussing and dissecting the concept, not each other (smile). I do feel sorry for the points of contention as they are being slowly dissected while still alive. Awful site to behold, rated X.

You say in #31542:

---You are right...Comex gold is "investor owned gold"--

Ok! For what it's worth, I agree. This is the heart of a paper perception that's always presented to modern gold bugs. Usually, the existence of gold in storage at some bank , warehouse or dealers vault is suppose to give the investor a feeling of security. As if to imply that that gold could be used to make their "unallocated" or "futures" paper account good if needed. Many average people walk away with the impression that that gold is in storage just for such crisis use. With this grasp of the mechanics, it's no wonder that quite a few investors think holding futures is of the same security as owning physical gold.

To all:
Yes, that vault gold can serve a security purpose but someone or some entity must still use "their" cash to pry (bid) said gold from it's current owner before it's used to cover your long contract. In the case where a "short" has no gold to cover and will not (or cannot) close his position the market place (comex acting through his broker) will attack his margin wealth and even his other wealth. But that can take some time and legal efforts. All of this works fine during normal trading like we have seen over the last decade.

Reading my last two (or more) posts one gets the flow of the real context of what future gold really represents. Almost entirely, it consists of the cash margin placed as security against existing contracts. Today, of the appx. 150,000+/- contracts open, 150,000 of those are shorts. Yes, some of those shorts may be using their owned, existing gold residing in Comex vaults. But, by far most are not. Again, yes, these other shorts may also have real gold to deliver. It may be newly mined, refined or held in a dealers vault. Very often this very gold is "in trade" and may have been
committed. In fast markets major commercials can be caught selling their hedged gold and not being fast enough to cover their paper futures hedges also. So, unless it is "delivered" against a contract, it isn't there! My position all along has been that in a crunch most of the real gold that could be delivered, will not be. The prime precedent for this position comes from the Bunker Hunt silver fiasco. Many of you have read the account so I will not repeat it.

Further:

Mr. Hunter, your post:

-----The short issues notice or intent to deliver... If you are short 10 or 1, you through your brokerage acknowledge your intent to deliver physical against your short contracts and advise of the intended delivery date (within delivery period)--------

-------Your question to me ...what if you have no intention to deliver gold against your short contracts? Your broker will insure that your position is liquidated by last trading day, or consequences for your broker and brokerage...brokers do not like consequences...----------

Yes, I know the short stops the waiting long. But, I always felt this nomenclature was used wrong. In real life who stops who? Who is demanding the asset? Not the gold short!

In usual trading, it's the unfortunate long that waited too long with a long position that gets delivered into (stopped). I say unfortunate because the vase majority of Western future traders don't want gold. Indeed, I suspect most of them do not have the assets to pay for the contracts they hold. You see the entire future system is based on trading the price of gold not gold itself. In this respect, the price of physical,,,,, derived from paper future trading,,,, is discovered from the trades of players that cannot fully buy! Therefore in my opinion, price discovery through this venue (and others like it) is fraudulent. Fraudulent from the standpoint that deposit money, placed as margin security does not constitute real demand dynamics. Further, it tends to discount whatever "asset usage" price is prevalent at that time because futures traders must sell to distance themselves from real supply. In other words, paper trading lowers discovery prices.

My point to your secure contention is that once real demand enters a futures system, this real, 100% money is the side doing the stopping (demanding delivery by holding fully and holding strong)! In this situation where crisis reigns supreme,,,,,,, where a known large long makes a stance
to take delivery,,,,,, here, it's the hapless shorts that are frozen and stop nothing. They cannot, in mass cover by buying an offsetting position as it guns the contract prices further against their already failing margin. Yet they cannot supply physical because they didn't have it anyway. It becomes the classic Bunker Hunt market where the exchange must protect "it's" capital by locking down trade. It's trading for liquidation only! Happened before, I was there. Been there and done that (smile).

So, will my BTD trade prove that selling out paid up coins and positioning myself futures make me more money. We shall see!

More on Goldhunter's post's later.

Skirts & bank runs @goldhunter

Perhaps I mis-understand this whole gold paper thing, but isn't the real issue here at some point _how fast_ physical gold can be delivered? If those seeking delivery can't get it on contract settlement date and word gets around, doesn't the confidence which must be there to make the paper-gold market work evaporate? The players don't care that they can get the gold they were expecting today a week from now. When that happens, won't that cause the equivalent of a bank
run?---------------

Hello Journeyman,

In real life, this run or lock up we have been discussing will never happen! The exchanges have the right to make rule changes to protect the marketplace. Read that as "protect their best interests".

Goldhunter mentioned in #31554 that ------Since there has been not one cheated, confidence remains.------.

Well that is actually a play on words and how we as investors receive these words. During the Hunt silver bust, the major longs stood strong to receive silver. They had the cash to do it, too! But in order for the shorts to "stop" longs positions and deliver into them, these shorts had to go into the world markets and buy real silver. The actual exchanges did not have the "owned" material to do it. Same situation that exists today in gold (and silver?)

You see, this was the process that I extended my last post from. As long as the futures markets are traded using margin funds, most of the short players are not prepared to actually deliver real metal against "REAL" standing longs. Sure, some metal is traded and delivered every settlement period, but it's only a small percentage. Once a real bull market takes hold, the futures cannot and will not transition into a major physical trading arena. Mostly because there isn't enough extra metal around to fulfill the contracts in a real physical run. In a real physical run, all contracts are discounted against physical. Only, to date, the marketplace has been able to change the rules before that discounting begins in force! We watched this happen while involved in both silver and gold in the
late 70s.

When push came to shove, the rules were changed to demand "liquidation" trading only in silver (it never got to gold because so many silver longs got their cash wiped out before the gold fact). You could not stand long for metal delivery and you could not deliver against your short position. In other words you could only paper trade the positions to cancel them out. In addition position limits were imposed. If my memory is correct we went from total position limit of 10,000 contracts to 1,000 or something like that (anyone that remembers help me out here). We had to close out! In profits, yes, but no metal!

So," sure" no one was cheated because you had to play by the rules, and that is not cheating. Right! Only later, after all the rule changes, did the banks close down the Hunts by restricting their credit. Funny how everyone still thinks that the public's selling of silver at retail dealers did it in. Ha! The Hunts and quite a few other boys were still ready to buy a load of gold and a half billion ounces of silver. It was political. New supply had almost no impact until after the political deed was done.

This bit of hindsight provides a foundation of why the big boys will not be had again. They will let the paper exchanges hang themselves this time by not being involved.

Further, what do you think of a marketplace that sets the price for gold but the traders run from delivery? Look at Towncriers #31555 and see how the "rotation" is in effect a run from buying gold. This ritual is the same "bailout process" that allows traders with only "margin security
deposits" to help set the gold prices. They never take real gold off the market in any proportion that's equal to the "price discovery" function their trading imparts. This same process is acted out on a worldwide basis on other paper exchanges. As I said in my #31562,

-----You see the entire future system is based on trading the price of gold not gold itself. In this respect, the price of physical,,,,, derived from paper future trading,,,, is discovered from the trades of players that cannot fully buy! Therefore in my opinion, price discovery through this venue (and others like it) is fraudulent. Fraudulent from the standpoint that deposit money, placed as margin security does not constitute real demand dynamics. Further, it tends to discount whatever "asset usage" price is prevalent at that time because futures traders must sell to distance themselves from real supply. In other words, paper trading lowers discovery prices.---------------

The political machine has used this process to their advantage over the last decade or so. Now it's about to use that same power to kill the currency that's so dependent on the gold price value perception.


OK, enough of my going on. I'll read more of others good words along with waiting to read ORO when he posts again. (good stuff ORO)!

Solomon - 100 fold
----A 10 fold drop in the value of the dollar has occurred in your lifetime.-----

Hello ORO,

Your background life has helped build a real working perspective about currency inflation dynamics! I wish more Western Gold Bugs could have spent some time in these "real life" countries. Or at least study their currency history. Far too many of them dismiss these awesome figures as a function of said money being in the "third world".

Most people understandably draw a complete blank in trying to see the dollar doing the same. Truly, as the dollar "reserve" function is politically removed, this real inflation will begin. Just as you witnessed, we US citizens will continue to use our dollars no matter how many 0s are added. I use Mexico as a close relation to this event because so many Americans travel there or have close business ties to that country. It's very common to use pesos but dollars are the mainstay. In the next event in our currency experience we will eventually use Euros as the Mexicans use dollars. Hard to accept but easy to prepare for.

This brings me to Journeyman:

Re: Skirts & bank runs @ Trail Guide

Hello again Journeyman and thanks for considering.

I used the Comex as an example because, like my Mexican peso example above, it's a market most Americans look at. The key to understanding our gold markets is in placing paper gold
trading in a correct perspective. It's not gold trading, it's leveraged currency trading with a little physical delivery thrown in. What hurts the public most is when Gold Mine investors and supporters bash the manipulated paper dynamic but fight to keep it in place for the gold mining industry sake. Most of the front lines battles are aimed at retaining the same paper trading concept, but "cleaning it up". Then, in their mind gold can return to it's proper "futures determined price range" of around $400 - $600.

This amounts to returning to a gold standard after a financial crisis wipes everyone out. Then the governments can start the same decay all over again.

We want to avoid this in the gold trading arena of the future by forcing the concept of "free gold". This has been approached by the next reserve currency backers. By trading physical only as the price making medium, gold will act as a real currency outside the established fiats. It's value surge will make it deep enough to actually carry a good proportion of world financial trade. But do it as a "wealth money", not a borrowed, lend able, bankable, government fiat system. A true natural vehicle for holding ones wealth. Most likely the way gold was meant to be used in the beginning.

I fully accept the political motives for getting us to this point. They are using gold to destroy an aging, failing, over debted dollar reserve system and doing it to promote their next fiat arena. The only difference is that they are structuring their system to take advantage of a surging gold price, not be destroyed by it!

All of this points to a breakup of the old paper gold trading business as a physical crisis eventually crushes their derivatives based equity. This is why we point everyone to look in that direction. All paper trading contracts along with their "price discovery" function are going to fail as the dollar begins it's "great price inflation" destruction. The vast majority of Western gold bugs are all watching and waiting for this event but reject the political certainty it will bring about. That being the
failure of most all paper gold substitutes to shelter an investors dollar depreciation. As such, the leverage in using these vehicles is lost while said leverage moves to physically held gold!

I'm going to place this post on the Gold Trail with reference to my discussion posts about futures trading. I hope it continues to give readers a new perspective as we hike this path.

Thanks

-------What did YOU do for the gold cause today?---------

Hello Chris Powell,

To simply answer your question: Myself and others brought more Physical Gold"! If one can only understand the implications of the paper derivatives tonnage your figures present, then real gold is the "Cause" to reach for. It carries the same 100 to one leverage any form of paper play can produce. This is true because it must eventually represent the entire gold ownership position our present world paper gold market entails, once said paper defaults! Physical gold cannot default or be entangled in the coming "workout" of this mess.

Support yourself and the Gold cause, become a Physical Gold Advocate in action first. Then send some money to GATA! (smile)

The Trail is getting Hot!
Hello all,

That was some weekend hike, yes? Let's talk while we rest a while.

Is BILL Murphy not heard? No not really, not yet. While it's true that his ongoing presentation is still not on the center of "anyone important's" desk, one has but to spin 180' in their chair to find a neat stack of it on the "boss's" credenza. Very close by, so to speak. (smile)

I know, they get a lot of flack from the trader crowd and spend a lot of time defending the gold cause. It's important time and well spent because a broad base of people must understand GATA's position if they are to help with the PR. But that bunch will never be the ones that actually transition the market. What I'm saying is that whether "The" report drives their personal trading is meaningless. It's the broad political position that counts. Harsh statement? No real life and real politics.

The same holds true for the media. That venue is never telling anything the real players didn't know two years ago! So, if the media appears to be downplaying the GATA news, it's OK. Because the story has been out for a time now and it's truly moving in a wider circle! Remember, the most damaging knowledge is the stuff that moves quietly, behind the markets. Seemingly before the fact in the eyes of regular citizens.

We said a long time ago that Bill didn't need to really do legal action to blow this wide open. We also felt they were doing something for the marketplace that was above and beyond their "stated aim". Truly, they only had to keep talking until the game is almost over to have a devastating impact. What's so important about that?

Well, most of the "big gold" world knew about the derivatives and all, for some time. But no one really knew when it would reach it's political limit. In the very same view that no one knew where the end of the dollar's rein would be, either. In a very simple way of saying it: both of these paper currencies would expand until there was no one else left to fool!

Just as soon as paper dollars and paper gold become political liabilities, the perception of the game changes. Today we see that perception changing. For the first time ever, the US dollar faction is in a trap brought on by the Euro and it's backers. With the European world operating in a more closed circuit fashion than the US, their financial and economic engine can continue to run without the supporting American drive intact. This makes their Exchange rate values less important in maintaining real local economic growth. Even today, after a huge, economic supporting decline in their currency, price inflation is still less that in the US! Confounding the currency trader bugs that present themselves as knowing just how a currency should act. Further to their discredit, a new Euro carry trade is creating massive new Euro liabilities that are based on the successful record of the Yen carry trade. A serious mistake, because that yen trade was done using a single nation currency that greatly depended on the US. A big difference!

The political agenda in both Japan and the US generally supported the outcome of borrowing Yen to invest in dollars. Mostly because the Yen must eventually be inflated in supply to keep the Yen in a competitively down stance to save market share. In a long view, both currencies will inflate together and balance that carry trade. Even if they both hyper inflate.

In contrast, the Euro does not need to inflate to remain competitive. We have said all along that the ECB is allowing the markets to do what the Japanese have struggled a decade to accomplish. That being having a weak (in exchange rate only) global currency with low inflation relative to the reserve dollar. This supports the internal economy of Europe without having to drive interest rates to zero (like Japan) to do it. Every day that this Euro / dollar currency mismatch continues, it expands the coming Euro Zone financial dynamics. The longer that dynamic is in place and growing, the less impact an eventual failing dollar will have on them. This is the fatal flaw for the dollar in this ongoing "currency war". When the dollar death signs are signaled by our Fed raising rates further, it also outlines the significant difference the Yen carry has with the Euro carry. Truly, the ECB will not have to inflate the Euro currency supply in an exchange lowering rate battle with the dollar in order to maintain "market share"! This will trap the Euro carry in a diminished currency supply situation that will literally decimate their (the carry trade) program. It will also gun the Euro!

The Fed cannot raise rates high enough or restrict reserve creation enough to slow the US economy without cascading our financial markets. This is a seldom seen typical function of a failing currency system off the gold system. Such a Fed action that would drive business into the Euro Zone sector at the exact same time that currency and it's economy is rising. And rising as local Euro rates stay the same. Today, the political perception of this risk is raising the dollar's political liability.

If the Fed does nothing, they remain on a full blown inflation track. Right where Europe want's them. A track that every important player in the world has "slightly" hedged by taking the long side of those billions in paper gold derivatives GATA has shown is out there! Yes, this is the very same super demand for gold that has been with us for most of the 90s. It's just that the physical demand is a little above supply while the rest of the demand has been channeled into a paper leveraged position. Even as many of these bullion holders elected to trade old physical holdings for leveraged paper accounts, they helped transfer the price making dynamics towards these dollar faction paper creators. With new (old) gold supply on the market joined with the unlimited supply of paper contracts, price discovery started on it's now well known down trend. A trend originally started in a joint effort between Europe and America. Our past discussions outlined their current split.

But something is very wrong with this picture today? If the political risk is now on the dollar side,,,, and your gold inflation hedge is discovery priced with contracts created with unlimited dollar supply,,,,, how will paper gold rise in a dollar hyper inflation? In addition, how will any gold supplier that must sell into these markets, profit during an inflation? We have hiked this path before, no?

As I said, GATA keeps putting two and two together in this derivitive game as players keep re-thinking their position. Eventually, everyone will begin to reach the same conclusion:

" " I have to dump the contract derivatives game and buy real gold,,,,,,,,, AGAIN!" "

In that process, the world gold markets, as they are 95% dollar paper today,,,,, will crash in the face of unbelievable physical gold demand. Derivative and contract values in all positions will be crushed in the race to transition out of them. Not exactly the end most investors had in mind!

We watch these developments.

So we see,,,,, it was never a war between the dollar and gold. The US won that game long ago by playing to Western gold bugs taste for paper! No, now you understand with all we have discussed why gold will run because of a fiat currency war. Not a gold currency war. Indeed, this war is waged between different views of what money should be. A currency war that will transition gold into a different world from our perceptions today.

Keep talking BILL, I said they started sweating over a year ago. Now even the shoe laces are wet! (smile)

Put your cards on the table!


The gold poker game as seen at Camp:


My bet for you card players: "Did any in our camp ever express that the Euro would be backed with gold using the current paper system?"

No.

The whole concept behind the Euro thrust was politically driven to specifically include only physical gold in a future "non currency" function. Not intertwining the present dollar paper gold system in some form of currency backing. This position was driven home by the lessons oil learned in the 70s and 80s. It was included in the Euro because a real threat to use gold as a currency for crude would have resulted if it wasn't. This explained the early warnings (years ago) from Another that "All Paper Would Burn" as gold soared in value.

With a future Euro backed by a "free trading" physical market in gold, gold's real value would be later seen! Upon hearing this, almost every analyst took the ball from us and immediately ran with it in the wrong direction.

The usual explanation built on the fact that the world paper gold markets would burn up in a paper short squeeze. There by delivering our projected "soaring gold value". Well, there is something to be said for that, but such a process would be short lived and certainly not be the real play that's coming.

The current paper gold world will die (burn) as it's value to users erodes, not increases! We have to remember that some 85% (or more) of the long side of our world paper markets will not (perhaps cannot) take delivery of physical gold. If the paper trading price is driven ever lower from new derivative supply, these longs simply "trade out" and take their cash hit. The major banks and players in this arena know this and therefore are not at risk from expanding their positions. Truly, they are only playing behind the real political game today.

Indeed, if the Euro function will ultimately burn the dollar and it's paper gold markets and replace it with a physical "free gold" market, then selling paper gold is free money! Right? This is but one segment of the coming currency transition and to date it's progressing right along!

Again, most everyone in the Western Gold bug game is running with the ball in the wrong direction. They are trying to understand just how the Euro zone players are going to get out of our current gold market liabilities when the Euro makes use of the dollar gold market! These same thinkers are looking for some kind of "work out" of our system so it's price discovery function will value gold where it should be! My observation from the "Euro Makers "is that one should "forget this notion"! "Noone" gives a hoot about holding "price discovery" paper contracts as the real thing. Except for those with the real power to trade something for full payment! OIL!

Today, paper gold derivatives are for selling because they will eventually be politically defaulted once their discount to physical drives their value next to nothing.

So who is in danger of being hurt as this unfolds?

That's right, the Western paper gold long! I'm not talking about just the US market! This is about the entire world gold market as we know it today. The real play will be for the ones that get out in front of the move by owning physical.

This stampede out of "paper physical" by the "big boys" will first discount that medium as all the selling comes to play. Then the real buying of physical will ensue. It seems every Gold bug sees only half the trade and has great faith that contract law will favor a short squeeze. Yet, none of them see where it's the long that will be dumping and forcing the discount!

Yes, the Washington Agreement gunned the paper price and was the political signal that gold was "on the road" to super high prices. But, when we said gold we were talking about the same "physical gold" we always point to. The process that agreement started was really marking the death of our current paper gold market place, not it's new use beginnings!

Whether the paper market was about to default and burn then (as we thought it could / was)or next year, the point of all this is that it's destruction is politically written in stone!

Still, not one Western Gold bug in a thousand fully grasps the impact of this. Most of them frantically search for a ray of light that shows how our "price discovery" paper market will advance in value.

All the while major players unload on investors all the derivative gold we are willing to bid for. At the same time world traders are buying all the physical gold that comes their way.

Eventually, "Physical Gold Advocates" will own a real wealth asset that's fairly marked to market in a "free gold" Euro Zone marketplace. The same marketplace value that will back the new Euro economy by pricing "free gold" in the many thousands. A new world class currency backing a new
world class currency!

So how will these big derivative players make out on their paper gold loans and paper gold shorts?

I think they will make a fortune because they understood Another better than the Western Gold bugs could!

Thank you for camping.

So the two large German banks are just fiddling and making money by selling (and buying?) gold derivatives eh? They're laughing all the way to the bank (no pun intended)?

Hello Cavan Man!

You know,,,,,, the entire world gold market is little more than a paper derivative today. It's nothing hidden from view and has been evolving in this direction for many years. So why do banks and politicians grasp it and Gold Bugs don't? We have all followed this unfolding drama from the
beginning. Only a few have known where it's going, but the signs are clear to all.

Building on the world's use of paper contracts instead of owning physical couldn't help but detract from gold demand. Channeling investment away from the real thing had to lower gold's value over time. In this light do we think the dollar faction was stupid in encouraging this? Especially if it kept oil priced cheaply in dollars. Any damn political fool could understand how this prolonged the dollar's timeline. Further: Any damn political fool outside the US could see how this would eventually end the dollars timeline!

Yes, we all played the same game. Europeans, Americans and Asians all brought into it and watched the system evolve. We played it because it allowed the dollar to give us it's last thrust for our benefit. Is it now so hard to see that this was all just a temporary thing until a better format was
designed?

Has the Western world become so completely caught up in the debt game that they have lost all concept of what is "lasting value"? Better asked: Can the dollar continue to denominate our wealth at a fair value, or is our current wealth not what the dollar says it is?

Truly, what is there left to gain by supporting the dollar system or it's paper gold network? Physical gold will be a strong man standing when all this passes. At least this is what the world's largest players are trying to tell you as they destroy it's paper substitute with endless supply. So why not sell the dollar gold markets for all they are worth? Especially if the paper and physical values are about to part ways. All the reasoning that I and Another have presented is being confirmed by the largest financial players selling paper gold into the dirt! Their very actions are telling of what is to come! Does anyone reading this actually think any government today is trying to "save" the dollar gold markets? After the Euro, there is no longer any reason for these paper markets to live. Truly, one has but only to look at the dollar oil prices to see that the producers no longer accept dollar gold contracts.

We never asked anyone in the Gold Bug community to accept our Thoughts as fact. We presented what we know is in progress and tried to explain evolving events in a light that helped others see it too. "Noone" knows who we are, so you can only evaluate out speech by educating yourself as
facts unfold. It is free thought for all that will consider it. We are not Gold Bugs nor are we in any investment business (certainly not gold traders / brokers). Oil is the asset, my friend!

Further:

Sure, some of these BBs and governments will get burned! Especially the US based ones. So what else is new in the "World Game"? Gold contracts? They are just a game, you know. Just about the time it all crashes watch everyone (brother, sister and friends included) try to rush the
paper markets to try and "hedge out" their paper exposure before it all shuts down. You'll see open interest and volume as never before! This almost happened a year ago, but it seems the US still had gold to ship. The next time, the whole game will fail and lock up trillions of trader's winnings.

If anything has changed (in the last year) in all of this it's been the proactive stance of the BIS. Where once they only stood by and waited for the system to slowly starve for physical, they now play the game to accelerate the grind. I think human nature got the better of some big players as
they couldn't stand not to make a few as the currency transition nears.

People ask where / who will begin the physical market? That's a no brainer. "Free Gold" will almost immediately begin changing hands in cash only dealings. The demand will quickly build a dealer exchange, worldwide. Yes, I bet USAGOLD will be right in the middle of it. This is where
the Euro Zone will move quickly to establish a "no contract" arena of it's own as gold's new found value explodes to the benefit of our ECB system. The world's ECB system, that is.

Will it last? Ha! Ha! I am always struck by that question being put to me from an stock / futures day trader type. People who plan their investments on a one to two day / year time frame but downplay the Euro because they don't see it's gold policy supporting it for more than ten years! (frown)
But then, we can't all hold physical at the turn, can we? (smile)
--------------------------

Well, I'll be going for a while. It'll be a week or so before I leave. I hear there are some big gold
talks about to happen somewhere in the world. I hope it's close to Paris (smile). I'll be traveling sometime. If my electronic connections survive, I hope to tune in from time to time. By the time I return, the Gold Trail should be "RED HOT" from use. We shall see.

thanks

Trail Guide/ Latest trail update

------How is such a free gold market to be maintained once it is clear that gold IS something more than just a commodity?-----

Hello Henri,

As I look around the world, I marvel at how many concepts exist on little more than human desire. Add to that a good portion of "political need" and things just stay on track.

You and everyone have read all the fine arguments (for and against) presented here about "free gold". If I had to pick out one thing that will force this direction it would be the fact that "free gold" will not compete with fiat. That's right. For better or worse, right or wrong, in today's world: Free Gold would no more compete with currencies than soaring real estate or soaring Dow stocks or soaring oil reserves (smile).

Gold was never meant to be part of an official currency. It should have remained a wealth asset like everything else. Traded around at values that depict the amount of currency inflation in modern digital currencies. Volatile? Of course! But no more so than everything else we use and price with
paper money. At least in a "free gold" stance, more people would own it, use it and benefit from it's true value then based on "real" supply and demand!

I further reply to your thought by noting to ORO:

Hello ORO,

Everything you document about free gold not working in a free traded arena is note worthy. I / We understand it all as you so very well present it. But your and our feel for the subject is different in that you probably cannot sell your presentation to any government. Another did.

Thanks all

Be back soon and good luck!

Hello ALL,

I noted in my last two USAGOLD FORUM posts (5-13-00) that I will be traveling for a while. Some of the time will be for research, but most will be as "time away". Will bring a laptop to follow the flow of gold discussion while away. It will be quite a few weeks before I return to this trail so
please help yourself to our path.

If all goes as expected, we will have a lot of ground to cover when I return.

RETURN
A Big Hello to Michael Kosares and all the people at Centennial Precious Metals!

And Hello To Everyone That Reads And Writes On The USAGOLD FORUM!


I have been away for a while and consumed some good Thoughts from many people in many places. Having only been back a few days, I have a large personal agenda to take care of. Once
that is done, I'll offer up my views and Another's perception on this ongoing evolution of Gold. Some of this has again arrived in the familiar "Another (Thoughts)" context.

By now most of you may agree that our world economic function is fast changing in a dangerous way. This new function's direction has blocked the return to "normal" markets and the "normal" paper contract prices many of us experienced in our youth. In Dollar terms, we will never see these markets correctly value anything in our economic structure again. We are on a march into total dollar hyperinflation as our dollar evolves. Now, more than ever for the USA, "paper contracts of all forms must expand rapidly" or our dollar and our way of life will fail sooner rather than later! I think this slow process is well understood by many quiet thinkers, worldwide.

From Another before I departed:

========

"Look every direction to world's currencies as these do price gold for modern economy. I say now this not price of my gold. It be price of "your Western gold"! These Western gold values be true! It must it has no weight! My friend, man who does control not wealth, has no wealth, yes? Indeed,
any man that be "surprised" as value falls of paper gold wealth he owns and controls not "be a great asset to one that sells such wealth", yes?

We ask now what be "true value" of gold in world if all have contract metal but few do control value of contract? A world where economy stand on "strong legs" of government money and debt. Strong indeed with good flow of oil? Oil that once was pumped for "two golds" of equal worth.

Two golds there still be this new day, two golds. However one holds no value and held by many. Other holds value as never before, held by few. This oil, it slow now until there be one gold, one gold for all to see!" This day on, two gold bring "weak legs".

Another (Thoughts)

=========

Thanks everyone, I'll be back in a few days or so.

Real Wealth?

I'm tired from traveling and having just placed my house in order am in need of quiet time. Instead of hiking lets sit out on the veranda for a while. It's was such a beautiful evening, even as night fast approaches.

At times like these I can almost feel the thoughts of hundreds of my friends, worldwide as they collectively think of how our future must be, will be. It's a common understanding, these thoughts, as they agree and extrapolate on several singular items. Such as: mankind's future is more often negatively impacted by "acting on knowledge we learned from each other". Especially if it is contrary to the natural world around us. Nowhere is this more evident than in the "Western Mind's" concept of wealth!

I, being of "Western Mind" am fully aware of how this thinking will shape our future that's directly before us. Indeed, from cradle to grave we learned from each other how to highly value things that have no real value. From stocks, bonds, CDs and currencies, we hold a good portion of all of these as our Estate. But this is expected to support our lifestyle in the future. Yet none of these count as wealth in our natural world. They have no value until exchanged for "Natural world" things.

These "paper world" values are little more than credits and IOUs that we "learned to value" "from association with our own friends" of "Western Thought"! Even as the end of this financial era fast approaches we continue to follow our learned "Western ways".

"Don't buy that which cannot burn, buy a paper share of ownership of something that cannot burn." "Then watch, with your estate protected, while all the rest goes up in flames!"

My friends, a stock trader is a stock trader no matter what company name appears on the shares. If they think the world needs more golf balls, golf stocks are the ticket. More computers or internet providers, then those shares are purchased. If gold is expected to rise, gold stocks are played.

If a paper game is in them, paper products are pursued because that is what these investors were taught to value. Is electricity is on the move, buy electric futures. Oil? Buy oil futures! Iron? Buy iron futures (smile)!

Yet, even taking all of this in view; none of these traders are acting out anything different than their learned "Western Concept" of wealth. When the future comes, and it will, they will own nothing of natural value that can represent lasting wealth for their needs.

As night has now arrived, and we must go in now; please consider this short talk on my veranda. Sometimes fresh air can free the spirit so it may prepare for the future. A financial future that will, like our current Western forest fires, consume all paper made from these same trees.

In a day or so we can carry this much further. Even into the direction of oil.

Thanks

Ready for the next hike?
Hello Everyone,

I have been wanting to talk about the palladium situation for some time. There is a lot more precedent here than most writers want to discuss. From my position, the discussion has so far been slanted towards the "long" paper traders view. Let me ramble on a bit as we drift towards palladium: (smile)

During our "Veranda" chat in my last short post, I made reference to how so many financial players work from a learned "Western View" of paper wealth. With this background perception always dictating that owing the price of something in contract form is the same as owning real wealth, their reasoning becomes distorted. Their use of a real item as currency in trade loses it's function and purpose and the mind begins to see "intent" (a contract) as a tradable or ownable wealth on equal footing with real wealth.

Narrowing down the scope of that view considerably, we come to the "paper futures" game most every trader is familiar with. Again, what strikes me as odd is the universally accepted position that holds these paper markets as equal to "the real thing". In both value and possession! Indeed, how many times have we seen council presented by seasoned professionals as to how the physical product can be delivered against paper if needed or wanted. Yet, in reality neither side of these future markets are prepared to "settle up" entirely, 100% in physical merchandise if push comes to shove. That's right, neither side!

These markets were never designed to represent the value of 100% physical settlement. That's why they haven't recently and don't today demonstrate the real price value of their contracted product! The closing price is but a settlement of opinion ABOUT "supply and demand". Not settlement of real supply and demand that has been sold to so many as "one-in-the-same". An opinion bet is never a "real value" that's equal to a 100% settlement in actual trade.

The only value represented in these markets is found in their ability to demonstrate the cash margin build up on each side of the total contracts outstanding. The closing prices of gold contracts have lately shown that there is a bottomless pit of margin cash available to create the short side contracts against any long position. This is the real reading an investor should take from closing paper prices. Not a real give and take of physical supply or demand.

But, these shorts are no more ready to supply real metal than are the longs ready to pay for real metal. Why? The "Western Concept" of wealth accepts that if the "cash margin opinion" of the value of gold is great enough to move the paper price upward or downward,,,,,, then that opinion is the true "supply and demand" value of physical gold.

Indeed, billions of dollars of physical gold is sold every day using this "cash opinion" to set the value of physical trades. With all world currencies in play by their governments, then gold's low pricing is truly a political gift for those not blinded by "Western values" and investing in gold paper wealth.

But before you cry foul, understand that it's been this way for many, many years now! The vast majority of "Western" paper trades are cash settled with no metal moved in a way that largely impacts the "supply and demand" context traders so often discuss and follow. Again, the "Western View" takes the position that these contracts and their closing values are a paper value that represents real supply and demand values. My friends, it doesn't and never again in our lifetimes will it! Today, these paper price values only represent "margin deposit opinion" about where the physical trading price "should be" not where a "Freegold 100% settled price "would be".

A fraud? To say that the shorts have sold a metal contract that they cannot deliver against,,,,,, holds no more meaning than the fact that the longs cannot pay for metal they have contracted to take! As proof, watch as both sides always scramble to close out the majority of contracts for cash before they must settle. Betting on the price movements of something is not buying real wealth and running from a contract should prove it in the open to changing "Western Thinkers". Waiting for the shorts to be had, in order for your paper investments to gain value may be a long wait indeed. If this continues further, and now with the blessing of Europe, it's the paper longs that may be had as the shorts are let off the hook as the market is destroyed!

Once again:

This very paper trading process was the birthplace of a larger world market that controls gold values for the benefit of those who will buy physical well under true currency market value. A wealth building benefit that is available to anyone. Below market physical gold, in dollars, is a deal available around the world to anyone outside the "Western Perception of Wealth".

In this perception mindset, most Western investors have purchased into the controlled paper side of the gold equation. They are lost in an outdated paper wealth dream that can never again be a value substitute for real gold. International politics and world currency realities are today pulling what little value is left from the paper gold wealth that so many thought they had.

In a way, one may say that the flow of oil was purchased over many years using this same cheap physical gold currency created by withdrawing wealth from these paper gold substitutes.

The fact that,,,,, for many years,,,,, around the world,,,,, so many investors adopted the "Western View" of paper wealth,,,, it changed the real supply and demand function of physical gold. Because the majority of "American Style" investors had decided they would do just as well by betting on the price of gold as by owning gold,,,,,,, physical gold was free up to flow where it was needed.

This paper market was born, not created and found that it could be "CONTROLLED" by the flow of official "margin cash". Truly, in a larger view it was our collective "Style" of investing that trapped many as "long paper gold bulls", not as much the flow of "opinion margin" that has been used against them.

So what about palladium:

The massive margin increase announced is demonstrating exactly what these paper markets always have been. They understate the real world value of the physical product by valuing it using margin opinion, not real physical supply and demand. If the markets get out of whack because too many players move away from holding "American Style" paper wealth and want the real thing,,,,,,, then the paper markets adjust by reverting to cash settlement using the "understated opinion price".

None of the recent commentary touches on the fact that the shorts also face the same huge margin increases. In reality, the move is a precursor to forcing cash settlement if needed. Once a crisis threatens to shut down paper trading, cash settlement liquidation is enforced. This is why the shorts need to carry 150%++ MARGIN to make sure of cash settlement (not physical settlement). The fact that the longs must also have the same margin does make the weaker players fold their hand. But still, many longs will stay for the end.

This is very much what is coming for our gold market, worldwide. Yes, just as in palladium (if it fails), long paper gold traders will smile at their big cash gains (if they can get them). But their smiles will fade as they notice how their $1,000 / ounce settlement only represented the "margin opinion" of real physical value. In the aftermath of a paper gold market shutdown they will buy a 1/10 ounce for that $1,000, if lucky!

In today's world, it's the physical traders that hold all the cards and will gain the most wealth for their future. The value is there today for anyone that want's it. The paper markets we know and love will die before they can ever equal the real value that's coming for gold.

To close:

The true physical gold demand in our world today is poorly understood and poorly calculated. While physical trades are documented as well as possible, little weight is given to the countless investors that own gold using the international margin/deposit paper markets. Yes, most of these players don't have the "here - with - all" to make good on their gold purchases by taking delivery 100%. Mostly they play the "gold price" in a paper game rigged against their ever seeing full value.

But if even 10% of this ---"I own real gold in paper form but haven't paid for it yet and have the cash to do it "--- demand was to surface outside the futures related arena? This demand would take all the supply available in an "adjusted" post paper gold world. Only then will the real demand equation be understood. Only then will physical gold trade for it's fair value as a world currency outside official paper gold control. That day is coming for the owners of real gold.

You see,,,,,, any excess supply would mostly flow to filling those that have contracted for it and have something the world cannot live without! OIL!

In time the real value of gold will be represented by real demand not subject to currency supply. Not the unlimited paper supply that values gold for political ends.

To reword Another's strange post: One gold is coming my friends, one gold!

Thank you all

Hello SLF and Welcome!

I say welcome because I think you are new here. But then again, I haven't read back through all the discussion that happened while away. As you know many of the posters on this forum present exceptional perspective. The kind that demands a comment or answer before moving along. Often one must be careful not to read them or risk being trapped here. (smile) Yours is the first I saw today, no doubt there are many others in the archives for later. So let's stop a while.

Your post # 35259:

--- I have been following your post's for a couple a years. I am trying to get a grasp on your current thoughts. As time goes on I am trying to see how current events will effect Gold/Dollar. It is my impression that you believe the Euro will be the currency that dethrones the Dollar as the Dollar
hyper inflates. What are your latest thoughts about the weak Euro strong Dollar? -----

SLF, I see this whole progression of events as an international chess game. It's a game that has been going on and evolving for many years. It's hard to discuss it in an investment format because far too many "hard money" traders continue to grasp each move on the board as a short term
isolated happening. From this view, they play these events for quick profits. Mostly they lose big, because this particular game is unlike anything in the past and continues to evolve away from past historical precedent.

On the other hand, there is a whole world of people out there that are making a killing for reasons they profess to fully comprehend. Yet truly, their wealth making is little more than a mistake of historic human proportions and they will have it all taken away for reasons fully incomprehensible!

SO,,,, For us to see the whole board we must wade away from shore. Away from all the shallow water traders and into the deep blue. There we can feel the real current.

Our dollar has had a usage period that corresponds with the society that interacts with it. Yes, just like people, currencies travel through seasons of life. Even gold currencies, in both metal and paper form have their "time of use". Search the history books and we find that all "OFFICIAL" moneys have at one time come and gone with the human society that created them. Fortunately, raw gold has the ability to be melted so it may flow into the next nations accounts as "their new money".

This ebb and flow of all currencies can be described as their "timeline". We could argue and debate the finer points, but it seems that all currencies age mostly from their debt build up. In a very simple way of seeing it, once a currency must be forcefully manipulated to maintain it's value, it is entering the winter of it's years. At this stage the quality of manipulation and debt service become the foremost determinant of how markets value said money. Suddenly, the entire society values their currency wealth on the strength and power of the state's ability to control, not on the actual value of the money itself. Even today our dollar moves more on Mr. Greenspan's directions than from the horrendous value dilution it is receiving in the hands of the US treasury.

This is where the dollar has drifted into dangerous waters these last ten or twenty years. If you have read most of Another's and my posts, it comes apparent that preparation has been underway for some time to engineer a new currency system. A system that will evolve into the dollars slot once it dies.

Out here, in deep water, we can feel what the Euro makers are after. No one is looking for another gold standard, or even something that will match the long life and success of the dollar. We only know that the dollar's timeline is ending and a new young currency must replace it. No great ideals, nor can we save the world! But a reserve currency void is not acceptable.

Now look back to shore and watch the world traders kick ankle deep water in each other's faces over the daily movements of Euros. From here, up to our necks in blue water, you ask "What the hell are they doing?" I'll tell you. They are trying to make $.50 on a million dollar play! Mostly because they are seeing the chess game one move at a time. (smile) Truly, their real wealth is in long term jeopardy.

Our dollar has already entered a massive hyperinflation. It's timeline is ending and there will be no deflation to save it. The currency and all the multitude of derivative instruments that make up our money system have expanded rapidly over the last 20 years. Even at a super hyper rate for the last five years or so. We cannot read it because much of what we "Western" savers call paper wealth has really become money substitutes that's value is supported by the government. This paper wealth creation cannot reverse and is beginning to enter the "natural world" of real things. The best sign that the currency has entered it's last, final inflation is seen in the manipulated price gauges. Truly, this is only the beginning. Eventually we will see roaring price increases in everything, even as our
government indicates level prices or perhaps a deflation in our price structure. This has to happen, because there is no saving a society's currency that has debted itself beyond any known example in man's past.

In our time we will all see the Euro become very strong. You will read and hear this. But, Another and I have know for some time that it will be the dollar falling away that will make the illusion complete. I say this because all currencies are but an illusion of value.

Eventually, either before of after the dollars transition, the illusion that makes currencies real will also undergo a change. That illusion / vision is the current world paper gold market. Often known as the dollar gold market. This marketplace will fail with the dollar's timeline and so too will it's use to value gold. In this time gold will not soar in value, rather all currencies will seek their true
relationship to a "FreeGold" market. The US dollar will some day see $30,000+ for an ounce of gold. So too will the Euro price gold much higher ($$3,000 to 6,000???).

It is here that our Euro has planed to play the game to the end. (more later)

In your post:

---- When Another talks about " slow oil" what does he mean? Is the current short term oil price increase the beginning of something larger and more sustaining?---------

Yes, SLF! The transition from a world of dollars into something else is truly an evolution. There is no definite point where political wills draw the line. Once the Euro was born and "online" the dollar evolution began to speed up. Oil, out of a seemingly impossible position, suddenly began to rise in price. The paper gold markets were adjusted in what was the first step of their destruction, the Washington Agreement. Now, oil prices are set to evolve high enough to test not only the dollar's strength, but to force the physical gold market to separate from it's paper controlling world. Indeed, our paper gold markets will very much simulate the same manipulation of price gauges as the CPI.
All in an official attempt to say that our dollar is not dying. In many ways, it will be the paper longs that abandon the gold markets (forcing prices ever lower) even as the physical price soars. Yes, the shorts may make a killing but the money they make will be worthless!!!!!!

Your post:

--- In reading your last post on the trail, you say "one Gold is coming my friends, one Gold"-----

I think Another means that oil flow will slow until we have one physical gold price. Perhaps this is the end of Another's beginning odyssey of many years ago. It could be that the REAL GAME HAS BEGUN!

My friend, the future of physical gold is to become a wealth holding of a lifetime. However, the world will not take lightly to such a recognition of private wealth gain. I hold physical gold in good proportion but am prepared to see it's current paper fictional value plunge to Another's very low
dollar price. A paper price that will be a fictional as $1.00 gasoline during a dollar hyperinflation. This is the reason I hold a lifetime position in a few gold shares. Their value may plunge to zero before things change (an event the shallow water boys could not stand with). Even in the face of a soaring physical price, investors may chose to believe the paper markets over reality. Don't laugh, the believe the CPI today and continue to buy bonds????

Your post:

--- I know you don't have a crystal ball to see the future, but I am under the impression you are a person that has high level information about what is going on with Gold/oil/currencies.--------

AS Another often put it, "I am but a simple person". Events will make this knowledge real, not the words of myself or Another. Indeed, only "time will prove all things".

I hope to continue this, be back next day? , thanks

Heating Oil and Natural Gas Prices to Skyrocket

Hello Market Talk:

I know you are part of USAGOLD but have misplaced your name from Michael's post.

Something has definitely changed in world oil supply!(smile) Can you remember back just a year or so ago, how everyone thought OPEC was finished? Even further back I remember people asking how in the world any of the OPEC group could ever find the money to buy gold. Much less eventually move the markets!

If I remember correctly, you are more of a fundamental thinker. Tell me, how could oil be worth $10 one day and now $30+? Was long term supply and demand so completely misunderstood? Perhaps our current world dollar dilution has become so powerful as to override our political ability
to manage it's oil purchasing ability. Truly there is a lot more at stake here than a coming bull market in gold!

Here is a clip from the above link:

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- October crude futures rallied to more than $32 a barrel in overnight Tuesday trading after a key report said crude inventories as of the week ended Aug. 18 plunged 7.8 million barrels -- a dramatic turnabout from the forecast rise of at least 300,000 barrels.

"Forget everything else -- we're back to record-low stocks again," Phil Flynn, a senior energy analyst at Chicago brokerage house Alaron.com, exclaimed just after the data was released. He also said the latest data was a "shocker" and will have "explosive" effects.
In after-hours Access trading, October crude oil added 84 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $32.06 a barrel. After the markets closed, the American Petroleum Institute said crude stocks, as of the week ended Aug. 18, dropped a whopping 7.8 million barrels to total 279.7 million barrels.

Hello 714:

From your post:

714 (08/22/00; 12:17:49MT - usagold.com msg#: 35309)
Questions for FOA/Another
Under the concession agreement of 1933, Aramco was paying Ibn Saud in gold. But during WWII, the price of gold became distorted, with an official rate being posted in NY and another rate, double that of NY's, posted in Jidda. The Saudis apparently demanded payment at one point at the Jidda rate. Aramco felt it was not possible for them to meet Saudi conditions and even diplomatic intervention failed to resolve the dispute. Ultimately, it was settled by having Aramco build a $70 million railroad between Riyadh and Dammam.--------

HA, HA! Well 714, there were/are a lot of versions to that story. But it does point out how far we have traveled from grasping what money really is. Our official money teachers try to separate the currency / money concept in order to make an inferior money (currency) worth more against
competing wealth money. Usually one is taught to think of money as something you buy wealth with when in fact all the wealth you own is money. Not just your "bank account" against "everything else we own".

That nice new railroad was wealth money and used as such. Yet it's never worded that way in Western views. Like this: "Well Jim, I just used my house to buy $200,000 bucks. Boy, there must be some kind of real wealth DEFLATION going on because my house money sure is buying a lot more cash these days!"

That works for your mind, no?

Truly 714, no form of money (all wealth money) needs an established exchange to be used in daily life. Lock up a herd of 10,000 people in the state of Kansas for a year without currency,,,,,,,,, in no time at all every one of those 10,000 humans would know the value of every tradable item. Yes, there would be a few taken by the quick learner/ trader types. But, trading wealth money is a fast study for most. Believe it!

Think about it: None of us know what our pocket currency is worth except by association. Give a Canadian 100,000 Marks and send him to Germany for a month. Trust me he will know value association in no time. As for our group in Kansas, if there happens to be a little gold floating around in their wealth pool, that metal will quickly evolve to become the leading wealth item for trade. And all of this would happen without any formal exchange.

I think most hard money advocates have conditioned their thought process too much. A little time away from the trading screen and into the real world where fresh air clears the mind would do them good. There is a whole planet of people out there that can use currency right along side all their other wealth to trade anything. Old Ibn Saud was one of them.

Your post:

---This episode brings to mind Another's assertion that gold would be traded at an artificially low "official" price at the LBMA (and NY), while physical bullion would unofficially be traded off-market at a much higher price. My question is this: WHERE will physical gold trade at higher prices than those officially and imposed prices? In London? In Jidda? In NY? And my second question is: In a capped market, such as we've seen in Tokyo with palladium, where would a bullion holder go to get higher prices? All the way to Jidda?-------

Why hell, if one had a camera he could take a picture of it being traded on the sidewalk, just outside the COMEX! (smile) Wouldn't happen, you say?

Like this:

About ten years ago,,, in south Florida and on Kauai (Hawaii),,,,,, a hurricane blew the daylights out of everything,,,,,,,, especially electricity! A person could have gone into any nearby Home Depot, Wall Mart or Mom and Pop store and see signs for generators. Say, $800 each. The
trouble was none were available on these "Official Exchanges". Yes you could buy all the order papers (futures contracts) you wanted, but physical settlement was dearly in question,,,,,,,,, soooooo,,,,,,, the amount of deposit cash placed against these orders became less and less. Eventually, these contracts for future supply became less and less wanted and even there "tradable value" fell dramatically as players fled the market! But,,,,,, these "official exchanges" still kept the doors open and offered the generators for sale at even higher prices. But,,,,,, just around the corner (in Georgia) and across the water (on OAHU),,,,,, in back alleys,,,,, one could trade for these
generators on a "physical market" that was sucking all supply away from the exchange stores,,,, at perhaps ten times the official rate!

And the good part about it was:
"they didn't have to go to Jidda!"

(smile)

714, a market will open in Europe, in Euros.

Welcome home, Trail Guide! Would you mind putting some of us out of our misery and answering this question (which is debated often here): Will real estate values go up or down in the hyperinflation ahead? Is this a good time to buy a home or land, or should we wait? Thank you from those of us who are trying to get our portfolios now! ---------

Hi Leigh,

Thanks to you and everyone that have welcomed a return. Real Estate better keep going up, because I own a fair amount! (smile)

Leigh, Many years ago (20+) there was a lot to discussion that a strong inflation would drive rates high enough to kill real estate. Well, it did hurt somewhat, but it certainly didn't kill it.

I think,,,,,,

that most of that perspective, then was built on our government keeping the dollar strong. In other words, if inflation got out of control, they would do whatever it took to thin out the banking system and save the integrity of the dollar. But, that whole concept was flawed because it was based on the government reacting to a relatively weak price inflation, 10% to 14%,,,,,, but maintaining paper asset growth. In reality, money inflation has taken off even from that day, only it's been manifest in the government considering virtually all paper assets as protect able money. This process has built a huge new money base that is inflating as we speak. Once this money base breaks into a price spiral, our leaders will fall far behind the battle of holding real price inflation at bay. Mostly because it would underscore the use of an alternative, competing currency, the Euro. Any attempt today to stop asset growth, runs headlong into destroying the very new money base the system is built on. Destroy that base and the dollar itself will fall away. The next price inflation spiral will run far, far
above anything we have known.

Under these conditions, that are more typical of third world systems, real estate will run as a real wealth asset. I'm mostly talking about residential.

Thanks

Hello Everyone,

OK, now that I have the mike and a clear mind, I'll say a few things. I see a full house and even spotted Goldhunter over there on the side. Yes, a little wave and smile back at you, sir.

People, I have to say that myself and most of you have probably heard official line spoken before. In all walks of life and professions, once heard the expression is easy to remember. I have forgotten the number of times guys have explained the workings of exchanges and markets to me. They spent hours lining me up so as to get a crack at my little account. (grin) It all comes out so neat and clean that the verbiage almost sounds like a preacher quoting line and verse right from the book.

Well, Mr. Goldhunter is absolutely right in presenting all the line items in sequence. (another little wave and grin to you 'sir) But, something happens between the time we read it all and hear it all while sitting at the kitchen table,,,,,,,,, and when our money is on the line "real time". I think the terms to describe it are "reality" and "real life"!

We can take in everything a "futures industry advocate" tells us as fact,,,,,, kind of like going to drivers school. You know, go the posted speed limit, signal before turns, maintain a safe distance, put your lights on at night,,,,,,, and don't worry there are plenty of officers out there to enforce the law if you get in trouble.

All these things are line & verse,,,,,, the rules,,,,,,the law,,,, the trading book. But boy once we get out on the Freeway (Highway for you east coasters),,,,, all bets are off! It's everyone for themselves! If the speed limit is 70 watch for that truck going 95! Good lord, I almost hit that
woman because she didn't signal! That big commercial trader just ran me down with a 6,000 lot sell order!

My friends, the difference between Goldhunter (another big smile) and myself, is that I speak in terms of what happens in "real life". Not what the book or officials say will happen. My discussion, projections and analogies are based on how real people deal with each other world wide in hard
terms.

Now for a little rebuttal:

You post:

goldhunter (08/23/00; 07:56:59MT - usagold.com msg#: 35388)

------The Comex price IS THE PRICE for gold to buy or sell at that instant in time...PERIOD. ---

Sir, there are many good schools in this world that could teach you the difference between a "contract agreement" and a "hard closing trade". Before making a statement like above you should consider enrolling. All COMEX dealings on their exchange are the trading of contract agreements. No matter if they extend out six months or last just 60 seconds, there is no "closing trade" for "PHYSICAL METAL" until that metal or it's warehouse receipt is in your account or your hot little hand.------ PERIOD!

Further:

Even when you have settled for physical delivery,,,, and paid out your cash,,,,,,,, you still only have a contract agreement OUTSTANDING,,,,,,, nothing is settled yet,,,, you have no "hard closing trade". That closing, sir, is when the days,,,, weeks,,,,,, or months pass and your physical is
delivered in your requested form. Let's add one more PERIOD to that!

Further:

Now, the above was the process of buying and closing a contract, not setting the price of physical yellow gold. In the above one has "bid for delivery" by entering into a contract. You have not traded any gold nor have you conducted a "closing trade" that IMPACTS THE SUPPLY OF
GOLD at the time said contract is traded.

As an example:
I have one good friend that is short some 50 contracts and does not have any gold of his own,,,,,,, does not have enough assets to buy that much gold if called to deliver. He would have to declare bankruptcy if the markets opened the first trading day tomorrow and the first contract traded
moved at +200 over the following day.

Now,,,,, the long holder opposite this poor fellow has a contract for 50 times that 100 ounces. But, he did not set the price of gold when he brought those contracts. He only set the price of those contract agreements. He did not close a trade for gold and did not impact the price of gold by
taking supply off the market as a "closing trade" would have done.

In fact,,,,, all he did was express his opinion,,,,, through open outcry,,,, of the value and integrity of those contracts should he decide to take delivery and "close the trade" from my friend

Of course,,,, in driving school we learn that everyone stops for red lights. It's the law,,,, right? It's also the official rules that comex will deliver is needed. But,,,,, in the real world we may experience later,,,,,, no one is going to cover the millions and millions of gold bets made world wide by people like my little 50 contract friend. Especially if the markets open +200 ten days in a row!

Your post:

-----Your OPINION that it is an opinion of price or other is wrong...You want gold, you get it...you want to sell gold you can sell it...100 oz lots, big or small...the exchange will accommodate your wish.---------


People,,,,,,,

We can't even get new firestone tires for our bad ones,,,,,, let alone find an extra 100 million ounces of gold laying around when the market goes up in smoke. The next time someone passes you going 80 in a 50 zone,,,, just remember,,,, in the real world accommodation is indeed
just a passing wish.

Smile!!!

Thanks all

The evolution and confessions of an unrepentant Gold advocate
Hello to you, Mr. JMB

I've had the pleasure of catching up on the postings for the past day and see from your recent message (08/24/00; 23:28:30MT - usagold.com msg#: 35490) and similar earlier expressions that you are apparently having a problem with AllanC, and with me also. It is my observation that AllanC has conducted his affairs at the forum this day in an exemplary manner (such as his 35479). He gave you a good reply, steered his remarks toward meaningful discussion of Gold, and yet you persist. What more would you have of him, appointing him as my spokesman seemingly, when you state, "My case, simply put, is that GOLDHUNTER presented an excellent post and ARISTOTLE was unnecessarily rude to him. You [AllanC] have stated that 'GOLDHUNTER posed a fair question' yet you said nothing about ARISTOTLE'S rudeness...well I will. ARISTOTLE is brilliant, no doubt about it. There are just three teenie little problems with him as a teacher...He thinks he has a monoply on all worldly economic wisdom, he is insecure (intellectually) and he is an anus. Other than that, he's great. I look forward to his next post...I just hope it's not to me."? To you, Mr. JMB, I have this to say. AllanC seems quite competent to discuss matters of Gold, so let's let him avoid any unnecessary participation in speculative defense of my recent behavior here.

Apparently I've been on a mean streak lately to which I've been blissfully oblivious. To tell the truth, I can't recall having an August that has been any MORE enjoyable than this one in my entire life. So, we can't chalk up my latest displays of "harsh" and "rude" behavior to stress, now, can we? Perhaps, deep down, I'm nothing but a bad, bad man. All in all, when I look around, my honest assessment is, "I can definitely live with it." Why is it wrecking YOUR day? Goldhunter and Adam Hamilton, if anyone, ought to be the ones calling for my hide or for my immediate banishment.

To your point, yes, you are correct--on Aug. 23rd, Goldhunter did raise a topic (to say nothing of HIS tone) that was worthy of a well-considered answer. I would like to think that he got this from both individuals who addressed his thoughts: me and Trail Guide. Again, I am surprised that you, a simple bystander to the exchange, felt compelled to raise such a ruckus over this. Which of my two posts, (8/23/2000; 12:40:51MT - usagold.com msg#: 35412) , or (8/23/2000; 13:46:33MT - usagold.com msg#: 35416) was the more offensive, and in what regard? While you suggest that I was "unnecessarily rude," my perception remains that I was "precisely and necessarily direct," and for that I offer no apology, as none is needed.

To end on an agreeable note, I certainly appreciate that you have shown me a measure of kindness in pointing out *only* three "teenie little problems" with me "as a teacher." I am certain that the reasons abound, and I shall be thankful if others refrain from adding to this otherwise important list, for I make no claim here as "teacher." I didn't come here to be a "teacher," nor did I come here to be liked, nor abused. As a matter of fact, my expectation was (and remains so) that I would fit in rather poorly and rub many people the wrong way because I have long since evolved from my earliest being as someone who listened fast, thought faster, and talked fastest. There was a time I gave very little thought to the nature of the money I earned and spent and saved. But as certain thoughts drew me years ago to investigate Gold, as a result of my reckless nature I listened too attentively to the standard Goldbug rhetoric of others and was not well-served regarding the influence it had on my pursuit of clearer monetary understanding or on my discussions with others on this subject. Fortunately I had no investment commitments during that period of tainted perspective, so only my perception of monetary affairs was temporarily damaged, not my meager savings at the time.

Fortunately, my mother raised me right, and I still possessed the capacity to think for myself despite the heavy influences of the Goldbug dogma I had eagerly absorbed with gusto. As I came to realize how many pieces of their puzzle didn't fit, I came to see that the explanation was owing to the well-intentioned reason that much of the "standard Goldbug rhetoric" was based on idealism. Well, that's fine and all, and something worthy to strive for, but in the end, we all must live in a pragmatic world. Happily for the buggiest Goldbugs, this same pragmatism also renders equally null and void the successful implementations of any notions of an idealistic paper-only world as seen in the wildest dreams of Keynesians, governments, and many bankers. As things are, Gold has a very important role squarely in the middle of a pragmatic world, yet too few people give much "theoretical thought" to this middle ground. Arguments are always made from the merits of the lofty points on opposite ends of a pendulum's arc. Pointless for making meaningful progress, to be sure, but God bless the idealists, anyway. (For the record, the Goldbug (Goldheart!) idealism--however unworkable it happens to be--is at least noble in the "eyes" of the individual human spirit, whereas the paper idealism is not.)

After a period of slower talking and deeper thinking, I arrived at a position with a realistic eye on the middle ground giving me clearer monetary understanding as it works in the real world, and also how it COULD in fact (and should) be made to work immeasurably better. Simply put, my thoughts had evolved from their starting point, and I became comfortable with my own concepts of a unique kind of monetary idealism that existed at the nadir--the bottom of the pendulum's arc. Despite reservations about beginning to share such radical monetary thoughts at this Goldbug-infested forum, in truth, it happens to be the finest economics discussion forum to be found anywhere on the web, and the credit goes to the good hosts (MK and TC) along with the high quality of those individuals who "infest" it. And to my delight, there are in fact some here, past and present, (I won't name them because it is obvious to them who they are) who also have grappled this monetary pendulum at the "perfect bottom" at the risk of receiving slings and arrows from those feeling ill-tempered on any given day who occupy the "perfect top" on either side--although given the Golden nature of this forum, our position at the bottom center surely looks like the opposite paper side due to the complete absence of those folks making their case here. In their presence, I have been further nurtured and heartened in my convictions that the international monetary system could and seemingly IS evolving toward this position.

Such has been my evolution toward monetary "enlightenment," and such is my position here--as a pilgrim, not a teacher--at the very bottom and on the fringe of the admirable and idealistic gentlemen who gather here to share their thoughts and visions of a better world and a better monetary system. I certainly didn't come here as perhaps some of the traders have--after having gotten themselves into an investment hole, hoping to argue, defend, and justify their way out of it. I don't feel stressed or defensive in any degree because my investment strategy has not put me on the ropes as others perhaps are. I have maintained a savings/investment position that is consistent with my understanding of how the world works, and to that end, I hold physical Gold at this time in such a large percentage of my net worth that most Gold bugs would tarnish green with envy, or else think ME to be the idealistic one.

Believe it or not, Gold within the system I endeavor to describe during my time here, though my views are unpopular, will be far more valuable (yes, and priced accordingly) than Gold ever could be in the more popular Gold-standard system. Such a radical vision? It promises vast wealth (for current Gold owners) AND international monetary stability (for everyone), whereas the Gold-standard vision won't propel your physical Gold near as high in value and has already shown itself in the past to fail under natural worldly pressures. Which system (and outcome) would YOU rather wish upon yourself and also leave to your children?

Keynes didn't call Gold itself a "barbarous relic," but he rightly called the Gold STANDARD a "barbarous relic," which is also precisely what the system of Gold derivatives and bullion banking of today has become--a relic of a clever scheme originally to offer life-support to a failing dollar-based international system at a time when the world had no other option. This patchwork scheme is no longer needed. On the other hand, freemarket physical Gold, as the pure and essential reserve/savings asset (unlent with no derivatives) is desperately needed in the modern world to indiscriminately bolster each of us along side modern currencies which are now a permanent feature in the financial landscape. Simply put, Freemarket Gold is the only way for a man to safely coexist with his currency.

Hello Oldgold,

I know you have held a forceful opinion for sometime that the US can and is still controlling oil producers. Your thinking was no doubt rightfully influenced by our last ten to twenty years of experience with the political world of oil.

What has been changing for the last number of years was our realization that a new currency would available to the world. True, it's nothing to write home about now but we as as a Western thinking group tend to underweight it's strategic importance as an "available alternative" to the dollar if needed. This subtle fact has shifted the playing field considerably when viewing the US ability to control oil flow.

Today, oil flow has moved from playing a fundamental game of pricing "use value" with supply and demand to pricing it's "monetary value" in supporting any major currency block. Concessions are now there for the taking. Dollar prices for oil can rise considerably higher with the US's behind the
scene support for this action. In addition, the world paper gold markets can and are being dismantled as a further concession to retain dollar settlement of oil.

Strangely, the coming surge in physical prices are now a 180 degree shift from keeping them low in support of oil flow. In the future, rising physical bullion stores (and dollar prices) will play an important roll in playing a failing inflationary dollar against an ever likely increasing shift towards Euro oil settlement. No matter how this eventually plays, our dollar paper gold markets will dissolve as free priced bullion supports the EBS / Euro system.

Your article goes a long way to seeing the mental shift some Western thinkers are only just now grasping. It's seems even Goldman has printed a paper calling for 50 oil! It will be very interesting to see how their stock is valued the try to ride the middle ground between a short gold position vs
long oil. In the end their much vaulted paper gold game make them a tone of money but without a market available to realize those gains. The more GATA talks, the more the paper world sweats. Not from a short squeeze, but from their market being officially evaporated. I know you, oldgold

Hello Knallgold,

Do you think LBMA and their entire operation are wondering what price that gold will eventually be offered at so as to flow back to them? You know, once the political flow is more recognized, then that off market pricing will eventually leak into the open. I wonder what someone with extra
assets would pay "over market" to put out their fire ahead of the rest?

The world sees supply as growing when it's shrinking to almost nothing. See my post to oldgold and you will feel "the deep current" in blue water.

thanks

Couldn't post this on the Gold Trail? Something Wrong?


Hello Cavan Man!

In your post of ---- Cavan Man (08/21/00; 19:49:05MT - usagold.com msg#: 35278)---- you asked for more detail. Something like a grocery list to check off as events move along (smile). The exact question came as: ----"What are some of the impediments to moving ahead with your
"freegold" scenario?"----

Well, Cavan Man, one of the toughest problems investors have with following the Gold Trail stems from their perception of how our modern dollar money values things in the market place. I, we, all of us have discussed this extensively. Often from a somewhat different view than mine.

From my interaction with people of various far reaching world backgrounds, one thing is clear: Investors and regular workers with a Western slant do not grasp what wealth is. Overwhelmingly they see their currency and paper investment portfolios on an equal footing in value with the same
"real things" that raise our living standards. Yet, in real life, they cannot be equal because these paper assets are only an exercise able future claim on our "real things in life".

Take my debate "Against" Goldhunter as an explanation example. His perception is typical in that the ---"prices bid for futures contracts are the market value of gold"---- (see msg#: 35427). These future contracts serve no more purpose in setting pricing function than do all modern paper assets we today hold as wealth.

In this larger sense, after rereading my post to him,,,,, one can see where the entire dollar world itself has become a "futures pricing arena" that "undervalues" almost every real usable item we function with in daily life. The dollar asset system, as we know it today is used as a value setting
tool even though it,,,, like gold futures,,,, does not entail the removal of real goods from circulation.

But wait, you say,,, of course it does,,,, we buy and sell for our life's needs every day using dollars! Yes, this is true, Cavan Man but in that process we as an economic society only use a tiny fraction of this paper asset wealth to do that physical trading. As an example:

Look at the daily trading of gold futures and gold future "look alikes" in London as they trade in a huge volume multiple of the actual physical market. As this lopsided trading is a comparison valuation that understates the value of gold,,,,, so too does the collective acceptance that dollar assets are held as equal to life's physical needs,,,,,, also understates the real value of all things in our lives.

You see, a futures system that functions as our currency or currency contracts, values physical assets without taking these assets into our lives and by extension taking the assets out of the market. This is the current money world we live in. The dollar in your pocket is part of a much larger paper wealth system that has evolved into today's money system. A reserve system that is not tested against real "supply and demand" values. With these money futures we may leverage our perceived wealth by thinking we actually control "real assets" just by holding contracts or dollar denominated paper assets. In reality we only own claims on each other's ability to produce,,,,, just as a futures contract holder only holds a claim on another to produce physical. Expand this function to a level where today's dollar world is and we can grasp what others see in the real value of gold.

This is the reality of perception that Another speaks of when he said -----"your wealth, it not what your currency say it is"-----.

Truly, this statement was larger than life to anyone that could understand it's implications then and correctly act on it today! Unfortunately, most readers just went out and brought more paper denominated dollar gold assets. Many have lost a bundle thinking they were hedging when they were just playing the same dollar game.

This takes us back to your initial question:

Western society and Western influenced investors cannot grasp gold's value because they mentally must denominate it into currency first. To do this they turn to the "market place" as the undisputed tester of values. But, as shown above, our market place uses a currency system that is entering the end of it's timeline and therefore can no longer measure "things" on a simple supply and demand
value basis.

Some of the things on our "grocery list" are being checked off as we walk this Golden Trail.

==========
This currency systems and the evolving nature of our current society that created this system is in the process of radically changing it's paper wealth structure. The government, as an extension of that society begins to support and maintain the asset value of almost everything. This is the engine that drives an eventual hyperinflation. Not a typical business expansion inflation we are used to,
rather an all consuming, ending inflation that does not stop. At this point the concept of sound money takes a back seat to maintaining majority asset holdings on a permanent plateau. By extension, the official stance is moved to promote all paper assets as "national money". Stocks, bonds, business function and even general welfare is elevated to an equal footing with the need for a good sound money in your pocket. The mood becomes one of "what good is a sound dollar if we are deflating"? Check that one off your list because we are well on that road.

============
The international value of major currencies become more a function of "who can manipulate them the best" rather than their soundness. Forget the trade deficits, asset price bubbles, debt overflows or interest rates,,,,, it's who is best at controlling currency derivative function. Traders buy using "official control" as their determining value fundamentals. Truly, at this stage the prospects of a
price deflation and it's opposing currency hardness are a distant joke. The US has now moved to using measures once reserved for third world systems when it comes to playing the money game. Example: "our national debt is being paid off"! Or the CPI rising .01%! Check this one off your list,
it's happening now.

===============
Those with power outside this game are seen making long term preparations for the day when the US dollar inflates away. They see where the dollar value is only a function of trade flow manipulations. Not real economic progress. They see where throwing ones entire economic system wide open to "bubble expansion" policy in a "come and get it while you can" experience,,,,, can only end one way. So they play the game while there is time and they play to win with gold! As
USAGOLD poster Henri put it today in msg#: 35547:

---- " If one considers wealth to be the accumulation of unencumbered assets of enduring value, then the pursuit of fiat profit to be converted to real wealth makes sense.-----

(nice post Henri)

The unanswered question that "noone" could ever understand was "outside the other CBs, who has been buying all this gold over these years?" Check this one off your list my friend.

================
The Washington Agreement has placed us "on the road" to one of the most exciting changes for our current physical gold market in it's short 25 year history. This part of the world reserve currency system was about to radically evolve with respect to the world dollar gold values. To date, the
ongoing dramatic fall off of LBMA trading from it's (also) short public life is leading to an eventual official evaporation of dollar based paper gold banking.

Someone in Another's group pointed to that spike in paper trading long before most had ever heard of LBMA,,,, and did so by saying that a drop below $360 would cause it. That ensuing round of massive paper playing was but a backstop to maintain the dollar reputation with low paper prices
prior to Euro presentation.

I point this out because many new watchers of our gold wars have no knowledge of this important play on the political currency chess board.

This paper game got out of hand before the Euro was born and the BIS was ready to hold the gold line at $280 if needed. But, the Euro was born and is now a functioning currency. Today our paper gold game has come full circle and most of the players that know anything are shaking at the prospect of a pure physical market that will stand next to the Euro.
Forget the gross volumes of derivatives on the books of majors, they don't mean a thing. They can keep writing contracts all they want but with trading volume falling away, eventually there will be no market to value these
assets.

If this process is allowed to mature fully, major pain is coming to paper hard money investors worldwide. They have hitched their wagon to assets that require an operating paper system to sell into. Outside the private markets for existing and circulating bullion and coins, the entire industry will shutter to a halt as the mess is worked out. Investors will be kicking themselves as bullion soars
while an extended workout phase brings their asset values to almost zero. Sure, something will give,,,, maybe? Maybe we are at the paper price lows now?

But most "regular" hard money people that read these Thoughts are in the game for asset preservation during a world currency crisis and or inflation. Ten ounces of French gold coins and $60,000 in mining stocks and derivatives will make them sick during such a paper work out. Other proud hard paper asset holders proclaim they have millions in the industry and are not the least worried. They also said the Euro would never happen, oil will never see $30 without $600 gold and $280 gold would mean a major US depression! Well,,,, Don't check this one off yet. It's still playing out.

=======================
Then there is oil. I will repost my recent and now "edited" post to oldgold:

Hello Oldgold,

I know you have held a forceful opinion for sometime that the US can and is still controlling oil producers. Your thinking was no doubt rightfully influenced by our last ten to twenty years of experience with the political world of oil.

What has been changing for the last number of years was our realization that a new currency would be available to the world. True, this Euro is nothing to write home about now but we as a Western thinking group tend to underweight it's strategic importance as an "available alternative" to the dollar if needed. This subtle fact has shifted the playing field considerably when viewing the US ability to control oil flow.

Edited note: this next item is where we should watch for the dollar to be impacted by an increase in oil prices. For oil prices to be this high after all the political favors we are owed,,,, something must be countering that leverage. The US must be endorsing the move?

---------- Today, oil flow has moved from playing a fundamental game of pricing "use value" with supply and demand to pricing it's "monetary value" in supporting any major currency block. Concessions are now there for the taking by oil producers. Dollar prices for oil can rise
considerably higher with the US giving behind the scene support for this action. In addition, the world paper gold markets can and are being dismantled as a further concession to retain dollar settlement of oil. -------------

Strangely, the coming surge in physical prices are now a 180 degree shift from keeping them low in support of oil flow.

Edited note: This next was the purpose for the short history of the LBMA high volume. It's use is now behind us.


In the future, rising physical bullion stores (and dollar prices) will play an important roll in playing a failing inflationary dollar against an ever likely increasing shift towards Euro oil settlement. No matter how this eventually plays, our dollar paper gold markets will dissolve as free priced bullion supports the EBS / Euro system.

Oldgold, Your posted article goes a long way to seeing the mental shift some Western thinkers are only just now grasping. It's seems even Goldman has printed a paper calling for 50 oil! It will be very interesting to see how their stock price is valued as they try to ride the middle ground between a short gold position vs long oil. In the end their much vaulted paper gold game should make them a ton of money, but without a market available to realize those gains? The more GATA talks, the more the paper world sweats. Not from a short squeeze, but from their market being officially evaporated. I know you, oldgold must also (smile) as I do at that thought!

Cavan Man, check off rising oil prices.

A question for Trail Guide
http://www.insidedenver.com/business/0826gree7.shtml

TownCrier,

Ha! Ha! I think we are going to see a lot of requests in the future for things to go slowly. You know how it is, once someone else gets behind the wheel of your car,,,,,,, you can only direct! (smile) Now with oil in a win - win position and Europe playing the good guys,,,,,,, there is no room left to maneuver. Alan no longer can adjust policy except to add more gas. His recent rate hikes seem to
be just a return to where we were before the LTCM disaster. All assets seem to know only one way to run and that is up. Just the direction a failing currency takes it's owners before it fails completely. When you think about it, Europe would like nothing better than for the dollar to get
stronger as it inflates! If the US can keep the game going just a little longer while everyone gets what they want,,,, good for everybody,,,, right?

TownC, I tried to load Gold Trails again. Didn't work. I think my post was too long, like you said. I'll watch and wait, see what Jeff does.

Hello Henri,

-----------1) If $12 oil is incompatible with $320 gold, then $10 oil must have been extremely incompatible with $250 gold. To what extent was the recent explosion upward in oil prices a retaliation for continued downward manipulation of gold prices?----------------

Henri, most of this maneuvering took place prior to the Euro being secure. There was a lot at stake if the Euro fell apart at that time. Politically it went something like this:

a.(late 80s early to early 90s)

US and Europe worked together to bring gold prices down:
to make the dollar good in gold for oil and others
to allow some cheap physical purchases
to allow some long term contracts to be established
to allow the continued flow of oil at reasonable, economy supporting rates

paper gold had not inflated to anywhere near these current levels
so contracts were seen as supportable
so contracts and physical were seen on almost equal footing

b. (early 90s to mid 90s)
the supply of freegold on the official level was beginning to run short
so CBs sold openly mostly to each other to create gold selling impression
so mine forward selling was encouraged originally engaging mostly CB gold

major gold buyers were ready buyers with cash or lend able natural resources
so naked paper selling began to imitate CB supplied gold
so same naked paper selling supplied some mines forward sales contracts
so falling paper gold prices drew out old line/ non oil physical bullion in exchange for paper
so falling paper prices brought in cheap financiers to sell into this paper demand

market is flooded with new paper and begins to override it's original purpose
by now US knows the Euro will succeed and benefit from a rising physical gold price

c. (mid 90s to date)
US and Europe split,,,, BIS takes Euro side
US encourages London to join it in dollar support,,,, print more paper
Europe and BIS stand to enter the world physical markets if gold falls below $280 before Euro is born
Euro comes online
Oil gold buyers don't like paper gold inflation
Oil stands to raise dollar oil prices if gold markets stay below $280
Europe stands aside and watches knowing what rising oil will eventually do to US dollar / economy
Europe adopts policy of "Freegold" by quarterly marking to the market bullion prices
Europe and BIS stand aside and endorse a flood of paper gold
Eventual demise of dollar contract gold markets draws oil to Euro support
Oil and Europe force Washington Agreement
Oil begins to raise dollar oil prices in effort to crush paper gold markets with inflation induced physical gold demand


----Your questions-----

-------2) How high is OPEC prepared to take oil, to force the gold price freeing agreement to a
level they are comfortable with ($30,000/oz)? I am assuming that OPEC is voice of this group. Am
I wrong?----------

$75 to $100
Europe / BIS are and always have been at least the political architects


------3) when gold is freed, will $10 oil reappear?------

10 dollars? Never.
10 Euros? Absolutely

----4) Can we look to the breakup of operations at the London Bullion exchange as the next
signpost along the trail? -------

Several outcomes:
Look for paper trading to slow further, physical becomes rare

or paper prices surge in a super run then quickly shut down as physical prices run away

or paper open interest surges as shorts try to cover before more players come to know about the condition of the markets.

or paper prices plunge to less than $100 as all physical trading stops. Then markets shut as physical prices leap

---5) Goldman Sachs is I believe as much involved in forward sales of oil and futures as they are in gold futures sales. I think this only because the oil index is also known as the Goldmans Sachs index. I may be wrong.----

These guys are smart! Who knows, this could all pass and nothing happens at all! (big smile)

-----How much of the "glut" of oil that drove prices down to $10/barrel existed only on paper? I am thinking that the same group that is driving gold down with paper supply learned this by doing the same with oil earlier. Will the breakup of the London operations signal it is past time to go long gold and short oil?-----

Henri, it's my bet that the oil markets learned from the gold market. For myself, in these uncertain days, I would never short oil or anything that a hyperinflation could drive thru the roof. If I must trade gold trading physical with a dealer is the ticket.

Sorry for the short format, I have to go.

Mr. goldhunter and ALL:

NOTE: It is rare that I am ever upset when talking with everyone here and truly I am smiling as I write this. The contrast of thoughts here is worth all the time spent reading.

I'll answer that good question from you:
--"Do you believe that futures set the price of gold?---


Yes!!!!!!!!! If every trader that has taken the short side of a long gold contract,,,,,, has physical gold " " in his possession" " to deliver against his contract,,,,,,,,,,,, then that contract market has indeed set the true fundamental supply and demand price value of gold!

Further,,,,,,(smile),,,,,, It also goes without saying,,,,,, that every trader on the long side of a contract must also have the cash to take delivery of said "in possession physical gold". If not then his bid is only a short term opinion that cannot be converted into a fundamental supply and demand function that sets the price value of gold.

Further,,,,,,,,,(SMILE),,,,,, because we all know that neither of the above circumstances is true,,,,,,the line of logic pursued by goldhunter presents and confirms the point I keep making,,,,,,,,that the present contract price of gold that is used to trade all physical is,,,, indeed,,,,,,
an understatement of and not the the true physical price. It represents a Western Style Opinion of where price should be IF they had the assets to complete the trade. This Style of investing is currently the reason Governments are able to keep the dollar price of gold low. However, do not complain and please encourage traders to continue to bet this way,,,,,, as it fills the vault to out advantage! Become a Physical Gold Advocate and hold a wealth no paper can ever value!

Now I must depart,

Hello Peter,

Thank you for using this portion of my logic to get your point across. In my travels I have found it surprising how many investors immediately grasp the enormity and impact of that statement. Yet, equally surprising it intrigues me just how many sophisticated, educated Americans see only a very
small piece of the paper contradiction that same statement entails.

Later today, I'm going to once again use Kansas as a testing ground like in an earlier post (smile). Asking 10,000 people to line up and do a futures trade for us. In this exercise we should be able to see how the futures understate price of gold by using our soft opinion instead of a hard trade.
Somewhere in that group, even Goldhunter will participate!

Also thanks to SteveH, HBM and others for "digging" deep in their mind. The truth is buried deep, here in America. With a good effort we will unearth it!

thanks

The big trade!

Hello Everyone!

I would like to start this as an offshoot from my post earlier today to Peter Aster (msg#: 35638). It seems we have run into a roadblock of thought. Perhaps a traffic jam would be a better analogy.

Let's talk:

In it's most basic form, this presentation has been that;
----in the worldwide modern paper markets, contract trading has taken over the roll of setting gold prices at a tremendously understated level.---- Years ago hard physical trading once did that job and did it at a correct level
relative the physical product that was changing hands.

For us to follow and grasp this concept change correctly, we must start at the very beginning of simple economic principal.

When someone buys a product and takes possession of that product he impacts the value of that item as it relates to the next person in line waiting to buy. Like this:

----------
When Joe buys one of five apple from the table of a vendor, he leaves only four apples left on the table to be bid on by the next buyer. This ages old act of "hard trading" demonstrates the whole human interaction with supply, demand, need and emotions. When the next buyer sees that only four apples are left, where there were once five, whether he likes it or not his mind will consider the above supply and demand possibilities. All the while personal need and emotions mix in his brain.

The result may or may not be a different bid from the first buyer of an apple. But it will be a true value assessment based on actual, hard, real time circumstances known at that moment.

When Joe brought that apple, he impacted real supply and forced the market,,,,,,, that's everyone trading behind him,,,,,, to form "hard opinions" about "real demand" and "real supply". In this dynamic, the next trade is not priced by "soft opinions" based on conjecture of "will Joe really take delivery".

You see,,,,,, in real life,,,,,,, in real trading,,,,, Joe taking delivery now, hard down, undisputed,,,, and this forms a different "mind set to bid" by the next in line. This mind set is what creates a "real value bid" instead of a "possible value bid". These "hard bids" based on "hard opinions" overshadow and usually bid higher for product than "soft opinions". In times of "Hard Trading",,,,"Soft opinion" bids even fail to materialize mostly because "Joe has shown that he does take delivery"! ========

Now,
I had today, asked 10,000 Kansas investors to line up along their border with Colorado. This nice straight border is very long and allows room for everyone to have some space. I asked half of then (that's 5,000 (smile)) to stand on the Western side of the border (Colorado for you non
Americans) and the other half of them to stand directly opposite on the Eastern side (Kansas). All of these people did this in a hurry and they remembered to bring the very last $50,000 in cash they had to their name along with a pen and paper.

This was quite a mess to organize, so I hope everyone will appreciate this effort! (smile)

So,

Today, while the Comex was still open and trading,,,, and the US dealer markets were open,,,,, I instructed all 10,000 of these people to enter into a REAL LEGAL PRIVATE OFF MARKET CONTRACT with each other for "1,000 ounces of gold". In effect, I asked that 5,000 of these investors contract to buy from the other 5,000 the equivalent of "ten 100 ounce gold contracts" that would expire in one hour. That's one hour before the gold markets closed today.

Yes, that's 50,000 contracts for five million ounces of gold that existed during trading today.

Further, not only did the sellers not have any physical gold, their last $50,000 in margin cash could not possibly buy the 1,000 ounces to deliver. Nor could the 5,000 long traders hope to use the last $50,000 the had to their name to buy that same 1,000 ounces. But their margin deposits did seem to make the deal real.

So,

While this trade took place and the contracts were in force (they were legal and binding),,,, I called several bullion dealers to ask if the gold market was being impacted. I also watched the computer screen intently to see if anything would happen.

Surely, with five million extra ounces of gold being traded, it would have changed the price of gold.

"Just think, five thousand rich Americans contracting for five million ounces of gold should have done something!"

Well, it didn't. So all 10,000 Kansas investors canceled their contracts by buying each others commitments and went home a little smarter.==========

OK,

The reason this little trade didn't impact the "real value" of physical gold was because they didn't trade any real gold. As big as the numbers seem, the real physical supply of gold was never touched. All they traded with each other was their "soft opinion" about the future price of gold.
Again, I say soft because they only traded bluffs that were for far more metal than their real financial assets could cover.

Their trading, like so much paper trading today creates and expands a soft paper market that not only overstates demand, but more importantly allows sellers to "vastly overstate supply without DRAWING FROM THE APPLE TRAY.

Further, the worldwide paper markets our margin money has helped sustain, continues to trade an outstanding interest that is far in excess of real available bullion. ------"""" Yet this outstanding interest is the supply gauge that so
understates what physical gold would trade at as it's used to price the much smaller dealer gold demand""" ----.
===========

Oh,,,, I'm sure 5% or 10% of my Kansas traders actually did make and receive delivery while I wasn't looking. They most likely had some gold and extra cash to make the deal. But with the size of the world gold market it didn't really notice.

By far, the majority of these investors were playing out my observed typical "Western Style". They trade the price of gold while waiting for someone else to buy enough physical gold to impact supply. All the while helping support a system that dealers use to price bullion at an understated
price. Again, a price that's not created by taking real bullion off the market in a volume equal to contracts traded.

=======
My reply to one investor heard saying, "why does anyone have to take delivery at all?".

My good man, then you would end up just like my Kansas traders as they wade in our modern mess. Always settling up and trading nothing, and doing it at a lower price. Because the paper price of bullion will continue to fall from a continued increase in paper supply. No different than the way our governments lower the value of money by supplying more of it. The correlation between the two concepts is indeed staggering.

This logic is almost like our early currency thinkers asking, "you know, we really don't need gold as a currency. Let's just trade dollars!"!===========

Of Currency Wars

Hello ALL!

Let's hit the trail!

While we walk view to the southwest:

Is Gresham's law no longer a law? You know, the one that say's good money will drive out bad money. One may look at our modern gold markets and say "help, it's not working". Indeed, if gold is the good money and dollars are the bad money, how come gold has gone down for all these recent years? Worse yet,,,,,, aside from price considerations, gold does not seem to drive out the bad money as people accumulate more of the yellow stuff!

Well, in truth gold can't compete because our modern world of gold mostly consists of the same bad money paper that currencies are made of. That's right, this modern world of paper gold very much functions as the same IOUs that currency is based on,,,,,, not much different from fractional reserve dollars.

So this is the same failing gold markets and resulting prices we all hear and read about. The same markets gold bugs watch with increasing despair as Gresham's law works it's will. By saying "paper gold cannot drive out paper currency" this law is proving that hard money investors have hitched their wagon to the wrong horse. A paper horse! Today, more than ever, investing in an industry or paper vehicle that requires a functioning gold banking (paper) intermediary will be devastating as this modern gold market evaporates.

Make no mistake, physical gold already contains many times the value these paper markets have established for it. When the price of physical traded gold runs far away from this imploding paper gold arena, the value of real money will them truly reflect where our bad money exists today.
Obviously, we are talking about dollars.

True, gold will reset itself in value compared to all world fiat currencies. But, that percentage reset will be viewed in a different context than when gold money was ordained by governments. Gresham's understanding applied more to gold as a bankable currency, not an asset holding "in and of itself". This is the future of "freegold" in our time. It will be much like comparing an advancing stock to the currency it's denominated in, a rising asset,,,, not a competing money!

Now look northeast, into the valley:

What will make this "modern gold market evaporate"? Well, value in a paper contract is a funny thing,,,,,,, it can change radically when no market bids exists for it to trade in. Like paper dollars, contracts have no value without a trading market demand. Walk into any store,,,,, if everything is suddenly priced in a physical trade format, our dollars suddenly become worthless, no?

If the gold market was to shift to say, 5 day hard delivery, how could one trade their contracts for gold? Yes, you guessed it, paper would trade all right,,,,, at a huge discount. But in short order, as a spiking price lunges upward into the thousands,,,, and doesn't come back to earth,,,,,, what counter party on the other side of your contract could deliver? Further, how could the bullion banking system match liabilities and make good on a cascading default?

Stop here and see how it could happen two ways (or a combination of both):

You see, all it takes is for one or two government and/or private entities to pull the cord. Most all of you long ago came to the same conclusion; a Dollar / Euro currency dispute could set this off. Outside parties begin buying gold with dollar reserves,,,,, on the barrel head for 5 day placement. It begins with twenty or thirty 100 ton orders ,,,,,, a billion$$ or so each! Not derivative orders, mind you,,,, hard delivery orders that aggravate and outline the soft nature of modern gold banking. They keep coming,,, days on end! Then, suddenly the paper markets "are no more".

OR:

The price of oil rises until price inflation can no longer be contained. Unmined physical gold is withheld from the markets to such an extent that even limited demand runs the physical price to a large premium. More and more investors pay a larger escalating premium to get physical "now". Such a premium overwhelms and discredits the function of paper market pricing. Bullion Banking must revert to currency banking to cancel out it's contracts. The run begins.

Let's check our political map to see where we are on the trail:

The wonderful recent essays by Mr. Howe expose and document a system as it currently stands,,,,at the end of it's timeline of usefulness. The purpose, need and use of gold banking has run headlong into a world class political storm. This end time battle has been in the making from before Another ever started writing. Truly, this Gold War will be about a transition from world dollar dominance.

As I stated in an earlier USAGOLD post (listed as #35569):
----- Today, oil flow has moved from playing a fundamental game of pricing "use value" with supply and demand to pricing it's "monetary value" in supporting any major currency block. Concessions are now there for the taking by oil producers. Dollar prices for oil can rise considerably higher with the US giving behind the scene support for this action. In addition, the world paper gold markets can and are being dismantled as a further concession to retain dollar settlement of oil. -------------
It's easy to see today that most of the major world oil reserves have had their value politically converted by the Euro's successful birth. The current trading value of the Euro is a small factor compared to this "existence" worth in our political currency wars. This Euro has broken the "cheap dollar" value placed on oil by our one currency world and now allows dollar oil prices to soar without constraint. Oil has indeed been rising after the Euro's first few months of existance The prize of this master play on our Chess Board ,,,,? This new pricing thrust, unlike early OPEC drives of the 70s and 80s, will crush the modern paper gold banking game and place the dollar and Euro on a level playing field.

And so the contest begins for real,,,, no longer must we talk in a future mode,,,,,May the best man win!

Thank you

Mr Gresham,

Ha! Ha! I never thought it would be picked up the way you saw it. Yes, I meant to imply that "it was driving bad money into circulation"! You are right, I put it in a context that could be easily seen as reversed. Hope everyone can understand it?

When I say Gresham law is not working; I wanted to point out how the dollar price is not reflecting this "good money" (gold) accumulation as it drives our fiat dollars into circulation. It's doing this because what we as Western Style investors assume to be gold is really paper.

Oh well, it's my poor use of thought direction.

Also,
I think the waiting is finally over. Everyone is accepting that crude is going higher and not from any fundamental reasons. This surge in perceived value of oil has become so blatant that it's obviously not just from demand. This will play out as a fall in all currencies relative to oil, but once it breaks $35 to $45 (or sooner) the dollar will begin to roll over. That's because producers are prepared to
bid the excess profits for both gold and Euros! By the time crude gets that high the US trade deficit will be truly explosive,,,,, and no one is willing to guess the impact.
Further, without a corresponding plunge in perceived gold values, using paper gold as the measure, the dollar will be going into it's first real free fall. I think Europe will allow a swift default cascade in gold banking, but only because they now have major buying support shaping up and it's being voiced from dollar reserve holders. That support will be aimed squarely at spot physical. A prospect that was not legitimate with cheaper oil.
We shall see!

thanks for your comments on my post, I'll try to word things a little more clearly.

Trail Guide/FOA...RE: ix What do you make of the OM bid for LSE as reported in the FT today?

Hello Cavan Man,

I think OM Gruppen would be a better platform for Euro Land trading. They are way ahead of the rest. It makes no difference who takes the lead politically, in developing future market infrastructure. What counts is the whole Euro thrust at the moment. Who buys or merges with LSE is not all that important, OM will be a European player whether alone or with another. So will London, they just have a hard time digesting that fact right now.

I bet shares will be quoted in Euros. What say you?

--------------------------------------
Hello Al,

I often write or refer to the Comex and their future contracts. But in reality, I'm just as much pointing out the whole system. With that in mind:

Every month or so a very large collection of open interest builds up in a leading futures month. From almost as long as I can remember, the vast majority of these contracts are worked off thru either cash trading or cash settlement. This is what I refer to as "running from a contract" because
they don't want physical delivery. There is nothing wrong with some of this because a portion of these traders use the system as a hedge. But, Comex trading is nothing compared to the whole world of gold paper and all the physical traded doesn't require this much hedging. Obviously, by a wide margin most of these transactions do not involve the transfer of bullion. As I said before, by trading and settling in cash, this huge paper pool has created not only an illusion of physical demand but a much larger illusion of physical supply. It is never tested for price validity by settling in physical and does understate the true price of bullion. Therein is the system for controlling the perceived value of gold. In this format, supply can equal and overcome any demand built on currency inflation because the supply is a function of the same fiat liquidity.

But this is yesterday's news. That period is ending with this end run from oil! We should prepare for the destruction of our dollar gold markets now.

Further, I fully well expect the entire bullion banking sector to be frozen by official decree and settled in an understated cash price. Even as the physical trades onward and upward. This will devastate many mines, investors and hedgers but save the banks. We shall see!

thanks

Hello Buena Fe,


I'm sure you will keep your soul, my friend. I think mine is still safe,,,, I think? (smile)!

But, truly,,,, our gold bankers were only following behind a political wave that's changing things. No different than the hard money crowd that has tried to follow behind a gold move. One group was on the correct side and the other was on the wrong side. Nothing more.

How many local and international traders you know that would not have shorted gold for all they were worth if they knew how the game was being played? Even with a pro hard money stance, I bet they would have borrowed all the gold a CB would lend,,,,, and sell it down with the best of them. Further, how many big bankers do you think are personally very long physical,,,, even as they voice their evil projections of gold being worthless?

It's no different on the mining front. Most (but not all) investors went long shares or pumped money into the business for the leverage it could produce,,,,,, not the wealth preserving qualities so many of them proclaimed of bullion. The same as if someone tells everyone that will listen how their life will not be the same without a new ford,,,,, then he goes without a vehicle himself to allow the purchase of ford stock for himself?????? The examples of these traits are all over if we look for them. Not just in the possession of bankers!

Every so often a change comes along that makes old fashioned ideals and concepts look like something only a genius could understand. Yet, it's just recognizing where we are on the trail and doing what has to work instead of what will work the most.

Physical gold, as simple and stupid that holding may be,,,,, will outwork all the brains on our planet. Like keeping cash in a shoe box,,,, under the bed during the great 1930 bank failures,,,,, the leverage in gold today is a thousand times greater.

I ramble on.

Correction?

Hello again,

On the Veranda for an explanation:

I have a clarification to make concerning our observations during the last hike. Right after it was done, a USAGOLD poster with the handle Mr. Gresham (#35943) pointed out my backward way of presenting Gresham's law. Well, he was very right. My post had a way of reversing the concept.

I thought it would be understood, but after reading it again it was obvious that many would walk away with the wrong impression.

Gresham's law say's that "bad money drives good money out of circulation". In our context, on the trail it was presented from a position that "good money drives bad money into circulation". No, I didn't say that outright, but that was my mindset. You say, you can't read my mind? (smile)

We used this way of presenting the situation because it better illustrated how gold today, has not risen in value against dollars (the bad money). By failing in this process, the stage for a value judgment to take place where people hold gold (the good appreciating money) and spend dollars (the bad money) could not happen. Paper gold prices were not driving dollars into circulation! There is no FreeGold price to judge and convict our fiat currency.

With this mindset, one can take the first part of that last hike again and (hopefully) better see what we were driving at. I have no doubt most of you have never looked at Gresham's law from that angle. Please understand that I often converse with people that also present life's trails in just as difficult a format. I hope this helps you.

On another note: Due to technical problems I could not post several pieces intended for the trails here. Here is a list of those posts as located on the USAGOLD FORUM. While you are there, please consider the works of other guides posting there. Many of them are well worth the time.

Hello Law,

Trail Guide: Questions concerning your recent posts! First of all, a very WELCOME BACK...it appears you had a most fruitful and enjoyable sojourn.
I too, have had a very busy summer and have not had the available time to continue my previous and consummate lurking and occasional posting...but I'm trying to catch up with the thoughtful and intelligent commentary of the many wonderful posters who frequent here.

My Questions:(08/20/00 msg#30)
You stated, "If this continues further, and now with the blessing of Europe, it's the paper longs that may be had as the shorts are let off the hook as the market is destroyed!"

After having read Howe's excellent commentary and also Murphy's, is it your implication thatDeustch Bank is absorbing the derivatives in order to prevent Euro "bleeding" or is there another context to this statement?
-------------

Mr. Law, I fully well believe all the following:

That the Euro and EuroLand's thrust is to have gold compliment that currency in a future context. Buried deep in the trading habits of our ECBs largest bank members are many gold derivatives that were expressly created for Euro cash settlement,,,,,if,,,, and only if the ECB/BIS make good on a
FreeGold based value for gold.

We must understand that the Euro is not bleeding, it is marking time as the markets evolve from political will. My friend, Euro value is a very movable item. Just as oil was worth only $10 heading to $6,,,, and now has been politically placed at $30 heading to $50+,,,,,,,, so too will the Euro be "politically placed".

Further: I think the portion of Deustch's position that is not correlated to FreeGold has no general liability beyond a failing paper gold market. If this world wide arena is inflated into oblivion and politically settled at say $50??,,,,, who is going to hurt? Yes, the very players that were trying to leverage against the odds that Paper gold would keep the dollar going and oil priced in dollars only.
Truly, if our modern paper gold price only went to $400 or $500 that move would maintain the integrity of all the gold industry, save the paper markets at the expense of many big banks,,,,, and save the dollar for another day.

That is not going to happen! We are on the road to super high priced physical gold at the expense of the dollar,,,,, at the expense of the entire way our modern gold market is valued,,,,, and at the expense of the dollar banking system that maintains that market. In the process we will find out that """your wealth, it not what your dollar say it is"""!

Your post:

--Also: (09/03/00 msg#34) Concerning the "two ways (or a combination of both):"..."one or two government and /or private entities to pull the cord"...or..."The price of oil rises until price inflation can no longer be contained."

In the first way: Who would have the INTESTINAL FORTITUDE! IN THE "OPEN"! To
"pull the cord"???-------


Well Sir Law, anyone that begins to perceive that holding official dollar reserves makes no sense in a two currency world. Especially where the dollar maker,,,,USA,,,, is forever running a trade deficit. Indeed, why hold dollars when so many more are always coming your way? Most
especially today (amd this is the major kicker),,,, if oil is going to punch the dollar deficit through the roof at $40,,,,, how can we soak up the flood that's coming with $50 oil?

Truly, rising oil will bring the bid for physical gold and Euros and it will be a worldwide based demand. It will "initially" have nothing to do with perceived (by officials outside)US price inflation and everything to do with our ongoing US dollar inflation. Watch oil,,, it builds INTESTINAL FORTITUDE!

Your post:

---In the second way: Will the oil producers be able to withstand the political pressure that will undoubtedly be placed on them?------

My good man,,,, the pressure is on the US to maintain world dollar oil settlement! The existence of the Euro is the Master Play on this chess board! Please dig through my last posts.

Thanks

Something to think about before our next walk down the Golden Trail!

Onto my back yard patio, please:

Have a seat and listen for a minute. Are you a hard money advocate and having a rough time with your assets? Do your hard investments need the present quoted gold price to rise for them to have value? Did you buy these hard assets knowing that they were leveraged to gold so they would rise faster than bullion? Do you buy into the view that these items are of the same security as bullion and therefore better than physical because of their leveraged? Are you in mine shares, futures options, share options, futures, not to mention plain old borrowing money from your trader against your physical account?

The one problem with all these positions is that they are also leveraged against you if the "gold price you are watching" falls away! If this current gold price doesn't rise eventually, your assets wither away? Or worse, if the present quoted gold price was to fall further, these leveraged vehicles could have no value at all? Reality dictates that in a "falling gold price situation" none of these investments will survive. So how in the world can they be of the same value as gold? History has proven that bullion retains value and maintains an investor's "staying power" through thick and thin markets.
---------Both manipulated and free!-----------

If you are suffering from not understanding all of the above, then it's because your mind set is running parallel with Western Hard Money Thought. Truly, you are running in the wrong crowd. You are playing a game that the Political Will of this world say's you cannot win! Today, the gold price everyone watches is little more than the influence of paper printing on quoted prices. Because it is not the the REAL reflected value of bullion, it will slowly fall away from too much paper supply.

To better understand and grasp what this means, read the USAGOLD post by Aristotle at:
(09/06/00; 20:34:12MT - usagold.com msg#: 36150).

He does a wonderful job of laying out what is now waiting for all hard money advocates that have isolated themselves in Western Thought.

Hard money advocates that take a more worldly, political view have already come to understand his meaning. Indeed, most of them did so long ago. With today's politically created paper gold pricing system, they know why being a "Physical Gold Advocate" is the only path for "Protecting Their Wealth" in the long and short run. Watching the current traded gold price is useless to them except to buy more gold at ever cheaper prices. We know how investing in vehicles that demand that paper price to rise "can be disastrous" in this evolving market!

To quote Aristotle:
----To be sure, it is not confidence in physical Gold that is slipping, but is rather a failing of confidence in the inflated supply of paper Gold that is at this time calling the tune and being reflectively priced into Gold by the structure of the marketplace.

Just as it always has before, complete failure of the paper equivalency awaits. The paper portion dies, and only the physical Gold remains to deliver your wealth to the other side.

In a nutshell's nutshell: The price of Gold is falling because we are witnessing the end days of the timeline / lifespan of a "currency system" known as Paper Gold. I expect considerable volatility until the "bitter end." ------------
Nice job Aristotle!

People, I fully well expect that most Western style gold bugs will become more violent and inflammatory as the influence of political will on quoted gold prices increases. More and more the line of difference between Physical Gold Advocates and Hard Money Investors will become a valley as said leveraged gold substitutes wither. Indeed, in the future that valley will mark the difference between haves and have nots in the coming super bull market in physical gold!

Some will ride their paper roller coaster all the way to it's conclusion. Yes, they will be rich, but none of them will collect. I submit that physical gold buyers that can grasp the political nature of this will come out the very best.

As an often repeated example I again explain:

---- Whenever the world gold price threatens to run away, whatever pricing system in use at that time is officially forced to fail. It does so not because the system cannot adjust to the new higher values. It fails because the runaway value exposes the political manipulation of gold inherent in that time frame and system. There will be no difference between officially forced failures of yesterday and today.

The only difference between then and now is in fashion! It's possible that this present Western generation is more interested in being "in style" with their hard money views than with actually coming out ahead in the crisis that awaits.

In 1971, the simple solution to adjusting the over expansion (inflation) of the dollar money supply would have been to simply raise the dollar price of gold to a level where every dollar (a contract for gold) was worth it's equivalent. But this would have exposed the manipulation of the dollar (over printing of contracts) that occurred prior to that happening. Not to mention it would have bankrupted many important players (like Bullion Banks today).

Back then, like today, gold in the form of paper contract dollars, traded in a far higher quantity than the actual physical that was delivered against total contracts (like LBMA, no?). In fact, it was far in excess of all bullion in existence at dollar prices at that time. As $35 was a paper price for gold then,,, so too is $270 or even $50 a paper price today! It had no real contact with the real value of gold. Sound familiar? Is this sinking in?

Today, like yesterday, any rise in the "paper quoted" price of gold, will have the same effects on the dollar contracts written and the major player that create these paper traded gold vehicles. Just as in 71, when official dollar contracts for gold were frozen at $42?? while physical eventually soared overseas,,,,,,, Our current bullion banking system will be officially frozen in US terms while physical soars. ----------- It will do this much much more today because the paper price is even further away from reality. Gold at thousands and thousands an ounce is in our future!

If you can understand Aristotle, then you can grasp where we have been and where we are going. In fact, read all his fine works!

In recognition of our fine host, Mr. Michael Kosares and the CPM people I add this:

In the future, a relationship with a good """ world marketing""" bullion and coin dealer will be more valuable than all the paper gold you could ever own.

Believe it!

Thanks

Here's one for you, Cavan Man.
My longish thoughts seem to be making very little headway in leaving a lasting impression in answering the oft' repeated question, "Why isn't the price of Gold rising?" They are either ineffective or incorrect, and therefore the question is asked again and again in search of a valid answer. In the event that my proffered explanations are ignored because the general impression is that they are NOT the correct, I encourage anyone and everyone to please promptly set me straight on the path to a keener understanding.

I'm inclined to think I'm not being met with objections because my position is fundamentally sound, but that I'm failing to provide a suitable and lasting answer to this question because my delivery needs to be reduced to a standard media soundbite. So here it is, in response to the question and consternation that you've articulated on behalf of the free world for hopefully the last time--to be promptly followed by a Gold rush as a million cartoon lightbulbs illuminate over heads. Everyone wants to know--

"Why isn't gold moving? POG is defying every historical precedent where, fundamentals should dictate AT LEAST A MODEST RISE."

IN A NUTSHELL (my own cranium?):
Physical Gold is flying under the radar.
It has been the issue and trading of paper Gold that has called the tune.
It is this paper Gold that is being "priced" by the markets.
The POG that you see falling is actually a representation of the falling price of paper Gold.
So then, why is the market price of paper Gold in decline?
It is falling for the same reason that we have seen ALL national currencies lose value over time--through a combination of 1) inflation of the paper supply, and 2) through dwindling confidence in the paper.

To be sure, it is not confidence in physical Gold that is slipping, but is rather a failing of confidence in the inflated supply of paper Gold that is at this time calling the tune and being reflectively priced into Gold by the structure of the marketplace.

Just as it always has before, complete failure of the paper equivalency awaits. The paper portion dies, and only the physical Gold remains to deliver your wealth to the other side.

In a nutshell's nutshell: The price of Gold is falling because we are witnessing the end days of the timeline/lifespan of a "currency system" known as Paper Gold. I expect considerable volatility until the "bitter end." (If you can in fact call something "bitter" that ushers in the dawn of a new Golden day.)

Gold. Get you some. ---Aristotle

Hello Strad Master,
First, I'd like to say I'm sorry not to have heard your music the other day. For me, there are too many links in the chain to hear it that way. But, it's no doubt your hand made the experience a step above the rest (smile).

=============
I find that when reading many of these strategic analyst, they look too much at the here and now. Their feel for the game takes on a traders perspective who try's to perform on what the very next step will be. Instead of observing the forces that shape and mold the minds of world players, they
(stratfor as example) try to interpret each act as the whole play. Certainly, being a performer yourself, you know that one note does not make the song. In life, it never has and never will.

From your post they write:
-------After years of driving toward a single economic bloc, bound by a single currency, Europe in stark contrast to the United States is battling severe economic headwinds. -------

You know, aside from oil (which I'll touch on later in this series) that statement flies in the face of Mr. Duisenberg's exceptional speech. All of the Euro bears are trying to make a failure out of each piece of this puzzle, but the chess game just continues on to their dismay. I suggest that every
reader break the US into the same pieces and view it in the very same perspective. Nine times out of ten, simple barn yard logic and reason will prevail in such an exercise, demonstrating which market is really in trouble.

While traders are waiting for something to happen, the president of the ECB lays it all out for everyone to follow. Indeed he has done a fine job of accomplishing all their goals exactly. Let's look at it:

------By lowering transaction costs and enhancing price transparency, the single currency represents a major contribution to fostering competition and efficiency in goods and financial markets across the euro area. --------

In any stretch of the imagination, this is an "ongoing" process. Nowhere did anyone project that this would happen overnight.

--------As such, the introduction of the euro represents a quantum leap towards completing a fully integrated Single Market in the EU and lays a solid basis for the improvement in the living standards of European citizens. ----------

Again, only a few short years ago almost every trader with an opinion was saying how the Euro would never even arrive. Yet, that solid basis for changing Europe has arrived and is in the process of advancing. It all just depends on where you are standing when viewing the process.

It's just like when Wall Mart comes to town, all you hear about is how the small shop owners will suffer. No one talks to loudly about the benefits to everyone. It's the same in Europe. The Western media picks up on every bit of negative change and plays down the eventual positive outcome. As
outsiders, we read it all as an ongoing failure that coming apart like a firestone tire. Strategic Analyst with a Western slant present all this news but fail to mention the same struggles happening in reflection in an American context. Truly, Europe is facing nothing more than the US has come to terms with today and throughout it's short history (compared to Europe).

When living in Europe, my Euros represent nothing more than the living standard I may attain there in the process of normal life. Yes, the ebb and flow of exchange rates do impact that segment of my life that depends on imports. But, what goes around comes around and the US will suffer it's
currency trials in good time. Currency traders that leverage up on Euros are the loudest criers of how that currency will fail. Well, I say it's good practice for their vocal cords because they will need a strong voice for dollars soon enough.

In the mean time Euro trade competition is destroying the profitability of most American and World exporters that go head up with Europe. I make my point from these now old statistics in his speech (Europe exports are no doubt surging now):

-----With almost 20%, the euro area is the world's largest exporter, compared with 15% and 9%in the United States and Japan respectively.------------------

Further:

-------While the shares of euro area debt securities (91%) and stock market capitalization (63%) relative to GDP remain clearly below 100%,--------- the figures for the United States are in both cases well above 150% (155% and 172% respectively).----------------

Now I ask you, where are the currency analyst when it comes time to evaluate the future using these figures? I said in one of my recent posts that many major investors now see the US markets and their guiding officials are adopting a "come and get it while you can" mentality.

For us, taking a long term view, it's easy to see beyond the dollar's politically maintained currency value as represented in exchange rates. Using the above part of Mr. D's speech one doesn't have to be very strategic to dodge the coming US currency collapse. Add those 155% and 172% with a good dose of high oil prices ($50+?) and it will eventually wreck havoc in the house of cards currently
built in the US,,,,,,,, long before Europe suffers anything close to the same effect. The coming dollar crisis will make the current French oil problems look like a breath of fresh air!

More:

---------A number of observers have argued that one of the main motivations behind Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was the development of the euro as a major international currency. This perception, however, is incorrect for a number of reasons.-----

------(1.) First, the "euro project" is to be seen as a further logical step in the Europeanintegration process, which started more than half a century ago, immediately after the Second World War. Its objectives were not - and are still not - purely economic, -------

I completely agree and his single points follow as edited:

-----European integration aims ----- (to) a stable and peaceful Europe. --------- the removal of all barriers to free competition has been the engine of this process.---
-----the completion of the Single Market in Europe-----

Again, this process is ongoing and will take some time to work out. Yet the above thrust is extremely important. The Euro objective is not to amalgamate "Europe's Political Will" but to coordinate it's strengths!

The benefits will be in the form of a world dominate currency built on the needs of a diverse group of nation people. It's strength will come from the competition between these various national viewpoints. Many Euro bears point to this as it's downfall and why it cannot work. I counter that
this view is shortsighted and stems from a thin world exposure that's dominated with Western dollar culture! Too the contrary, a money based on conflicting viewpoints will better regulate a fiat's worst tendencies and become it's most attractive quality. A factor that later endears it to the majority of world investors. In contrast to the current dollar, that currency is built on the needs of one political
house of people and therefore is structured to benefit only that single political will.

For the ECB, their mandate takes the form of making the Euro work for 11 different European cultures "FIRST", in the form of long term internal price stability! Not exchange rate function against the dollar. From his speech:

-------The primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro area.------

It will be easy for this to work "long term" because their economic house is:

---------The euro area represents a large and relatively closed economy.----------

To continue from his speech I repeat his opening:

-------------A number of observers have argued that one of the main motivations behind Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was the development of the euro as a major international currency. This perception, however, is incorrect for a number of reasons.-----

Having given (1.) above:

------(2.) Second, the international use of the euro is, first and foremost, the outcome of a market-driven process, not to be steered by central banks or by political bodies. The ECB has adopted a neutral stance on the internationalisation of the euro. The ECB intends neither to foster nor to hinder the use of the euro.------------

I don't know how many old time traders are reading this, but it seems that most of them forgot the "dirty float" problems of the 60s, 70s and 80s! Every hard currency and hard money advocate out there cried about the ongoing currency manipulations then. Now, we finally have a fiat that's being
built on a "no intervention" format and they all are asking for it's head? Any fool can clearly see from the above (and it's ongoing management!!!) that the Euro policy is aimed at fostering an entirely different animal from the current dollar system.

For myself, all of this rhetoric is a blinding example that proves a point in one of my posts. It was pointed out how the Western slant has shifted to value a currency more by the ability of it's officials to manipulate it than by the economic background that supports said money. But listen closely when the tide turns for the dollar and the ECB stands with it's hands still. When the dollar reverses
and goes up in flames, the whole hard currency crowd will be crying for the ECB to give in and help! Especially help make the paper gold system whole again so that the mining (and their supporting bullion banking) industry can survive. We shall see.

To further my points:

-----In the past, major countries have, at times, tended to promote the international use of their currency, primarily with a view to potential benefits for their national financial sectors.-----

Was that a shot at the dollar system?

----There have also been cases in which major countries have resisted the internationalisation of their currency, owing to the uncertainties that this process may imply for the conduct of monetary policy.-------

Was that a shot at the Yen system?

To continue from his speech I repeat his opening:

-------------A number of observers have argued that one of the main motivations behind Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was the development of the euro as a major international currency. This perception, however, is incorrect for a number of reasons.-----

Having given (1.) and (2.) above:

-----(3.) Third-------two basic factors might eventually determine the international role of the euro - size and risk.------

First factor, size:
-----With regard to the size factor, a broad, deep and liquid euro area capital market may lead to a greater use of the euro through lower transaction costs. This may, in turn, facilitate the development of the euro as a vehicle currency for trade and commodity pricing. ----------

How much size are we comparing? From his opening:

---------Given its population of almost 300 million people and its significant weight in the global economy, the euro area is broadly comparable with the United States. ---------- the most striking fact is that the euro area economy has a share of world output of around 16%. -------- significantly higher than that of Japan (8%), while being lower than that of the United States (21%)---------

Second factor, risk:
-------the international use of a currency is determined by risk factors, since investors may use the euro to hedge their risks through diversification across international currencies.-------

-------I should make clear that maintaining price stability ----------- is also a major precondition for a currency to play an international role.-------

-------As regards the private use of the euro, recent trends show that it has mainly been used as a financing currency. ------- The growing use of the euro was mainly mirrored in a decline in the share of US dollar-denominated issues from 58% to 48% between 1998 and 1999. These trends are even more striking if one focuses on the bonds and notes segment of the market. ------

I point out that USAGOLD poster ORO has written extensively on this growing process. Indeed, the above size and risk determinants may point to the Euro becoming replacement for the dollar. For a currency that's about to fail, it sure is progressing one solid step at a time.

As I have said, today's exchange values between dollars and Euros represent a fraud (the dollar) being propped up and a plain man (the Euro) shown as he is. Once the dollar turns from an oil settlement currency to a competing oil settlement currency, it will stand on equal ground with a Euro contender that must eventually be a true international currency. Indeed, as Mr. Duisenberg has presented, the ECB will not manipulate the Euro to international status. Truly, the world will do it for him.


Thanks for your time Strad Master, it was my pleasure

Golden Hook (9/10/2000; 11:59:42MT - usagold.com msg#: 36388) Sirs: FOA and ANOTHER-
When William F. Duiesenberg declared war on curriences, particular the Dollar, Is not this the start of a new world war on all currencies for all the world to hear?
I believe this announcement was more important than the Washington Agreement. I believe now all is left is for ME to make their announcement. Thank you.

========================
Hello Golden Hook,

If you read my recent reply to Strad Master, then it should become apparent that William F. is not declaring war. Rather he is continuing a policy that will allow the US dollar to destroy itself. By inflating the paper gold markets into uselessness, the US has removed the only vehicle that added
enough value to our dollar currency to keep oil prices in check. Now that the Euro is clearly separated from our dollar system and able to make good on it's physical portion (convertible) of gold debt, we are off to the races. Oil will rise until one of the currency systems fail! With the weak nature of the US debt situation, real world price inflation will break the dollar economy first. It will
also break the dollar gold system through physical demand. It will force a dollar cash settlement for failing gold banking contracts in place of physical delivery. This process will create a cascading default that literally shuts down all paper gold markets. In the meantime any perceived weakness in the Euro will be countered in a soaring physical gold price. This sudden strength in Euros will allow
settlement of all optional (physical or non- physical) gold loans in Euro cash instead of dollar cash.

I don't think Mr. Duiesenberg's speech was more important than the WA. Rather it was the next step as this political drama unfolds. Conditions are being created that will allow a reasonable excuse for oil to be partially settled in Euros. I expect Europe will be given a choice of paying for
Arabian oil in either dollars or euros. This will be politically correct but functionally strengthening for
the Euro. We shall see.

Thanks

Hello ORO!

Good to see you back. Nice works. I'll have some comments soon.

Ph in LA,
I saw your post the other day about Euro oil settlements. Could not post then or recently because I'm receiving too much other imput. Am trying to archive as many question posts (and post I want to comment on) as possible.

My goodness, USAGOLD is way up there in the linkage department. I think people would be surprised at who is reading here (smile)!

Be back tomorrow

Hello Michael,
Your discussion about LBMA is very good. The trail curves as we lean forward to see what is before us.

Yes, I will try to further refine that post. I'll place some current things aside and call upon the Thoughts of close friends. Will return (not today) to discuss what has evolved .

Gather Around!
Hello Everyone and New Readers!

On with the packs:

This is a pre-hike post intended create a feel for the gold trail as we have "seen it" and prepare for the next hike. I use the term "as we see it" loosely because much of what has happened and what is coming we (Another, myself and others) prepared for long ago. Our actions were based on an ongoing "real life" evolution in political power structure as it related to currencies and gold. Not some possible outcome as so many attribute these works as referring too. This political evolution we are involved in has been in the thinking process for 30 years and in the actual implementation for perhaps the last 10 to 20 years. The flow of events were correctly expected to pick up steam considerably from 1995 to date. They did and Another began to privately discuss these changes in the early 90s (later through various intermediaries on the internet). All in an attempt to prepare his citizens and friends for the eventual outcome.

Another's style and flavor of writing reflected his background culture and human level of understanding wealth. On this level, gold was a real wealth holding. An asset held in an equal wealth concept to every other real thing we possess. It was something to save and / or eventually spend as needed. During it's accumulation it was understood that gold's current price (over the last 25 years) was something different from this wealth asset value. To say the least, this was a far cry from accepted hard money discussion during this time. Most of which focused on trading the price of gold for what constituted nickels compared to saving real gold for a personal family fortune in the making.

In a Western Style World where "the dollar market system's" trading price was seen as the only real price for anything, investors forgot that when it comes to gold, governments may not control it (physical gold) but they do control "the dollar gold market system". I say forgot but it's doubtful some ever knew. Many still feel to this day that gold was set free in 1971. Today, this same "control" concept that was laughed at only a few years ago, most hard money thinkers have come to agree is true. In the future directly before us, our gold trail is leading around a curve that once again the hard money crowd is laughing at. What they do not know is that Another has already walked the trail our eyes have not seen. Yes, the footprints of Giants are there and easy to follow, he is just ahead, around the next curve.

This current phase of public writing and discussion (last 3 years or so) was implemented by Another so as to concentrate the average investor's thinking on certain aspects of these coming economic changes as they evolved. He always wanted people to see the actual flow of events as creating a background in their minds of the political evolution his directions were pointing to. In other words, use his map, place it over the events as they occur and consider (not accept) the direction. Over and over, he said that in this process, as your understanding grew (changed), events would prove his Thoughts. Events, not his words or mine! To that end, until he decides to write again, following his lead, my seemingly poorly thought, fragmented posts will become more academic. As events unfold and the trail straightens, my clarity will grow with your understanding.

The Common Person's Strategy

Because this currency transition is in a fluid progression, using a price sensitive gold substitute investment during such a dynamic political process was useless. Perhaps dangerous! Just as in the game of chess, for most average investors there are no public, permanent hard facts to cling to. Yes, chess players and even poker players can and do give out signals opposite their intended play. Further, in this political world game a solid move is countered with an opposite move that renders each step to be very short term in nature. For small private investors, only the game's end will have the most long term lasting effect on their wealth. It would also create the most massive gains for anyone that can continue to "stay and hold to the end". Indeed, this meant using a vehicle that history has shown was certain to outlive the chess game. Physical gold value has outlived the battles of many kings and queens during 2,000+ years of chess moves. Truly, in our time, the next very large match is about to be concluded.

Another's posting was done to report where we were located on the political board. Not intended to make a "Market Call" for gold substitute players. To date, his only point was for citizens to buy physical gold for a run of a lifetime. To date (from his beginning posts), any hard money advocate that has left the gold substitute game for a physical position is in a major "wealth ahead" position compared to the pounding paper gold substitutes have taken. Indeed, that accumulated asset value builds and remains to be realized in the final days. To this end, the prize of physical gold in the thousands will make many a gold substitute player sick to see. There is no possible way the current dollar system's "political will" can allow the gold industry or it's gold banking system to experience such a dynamic gain / loss relationship. For many sophisticated players, hooked on an outdated failing concept of saving gold substitutes our currency evolution will be a painful learning experience. Yes, a few gold mining companies will make it and so too will some in the gold banking industry. It's possible they will do extremely well, but the gains will only compare evenly to the gains in physical gold. It's that simple! Truly, it will all be documented and followed on the USAGOLD forum as it unfolds.

Again, the drive behind making these free offerings public was to point the largest number of average citizens to look in the right direction. These changes were (then) about spill out into the open in a piece meal, seemly unrelated fashion. Yet, they were all connected in a way "Western Eyes" were not focused to see.

Without giving specific details, those Thoughts forced people to see our currency evolution in a way few others could or wanted too. In this fashion private citizens had to follow "events" in a different light from accepted media reporting. It is gratifying to see many people (on these forums and privately) acknowledge how his Thoughts had done this. Recently USAGOLD poster SteveH (and many others) said as much. Thanks from Another and myself!

We'll walk quietly to that tree ahead. Then I'll discuss the evolution from my old post as offered in USAGOLD #36622.

Onward

After six miles we arrive at the burial tree!

Everyone here?

I've stopped at this burial tree to have a look at something Michael Kosares found while hiking. It seems he and a USAGOLD poster (Invisible Hand) are examining the "old bones" of a post. That post was written and placed here on 08/10/98. After reviewing it, I agree they are my "old bones" (smile). What do they tell us today?

===================================

From 8/10/98 Friend of ANOTHER
Michael Kosares,

It has taken some time to send this, but now I can also offer my thoughts to your questions.

Your statement: (from MK) "As a matter of long term policy, do you believe that ECB will "sell" gold to defend the Euro or "buy" gold to defend the Euro? Each of course would entail a different course of action with respect to reserves of the new national bank. Along these lines, will ECB buy gold from its member treasuries, or will it simply force them to transfer it to ECB coffers if needed to defend the Euro? I am prompted to ask this question in view of your assertion that there will be much selling of Euros to defend the dollar. If the Euro, as you suggested, is being printed to buy dollars isn't this just another manifestation of the U.S. exporting its inflation? It appears to me that the Euro will need to be defended -- and not with dollars -- but with gold! "
======================================

Well Michael,

The ECB and Duisenberg have it right.

It's the dollar that's too strong (compared to it's management policy), not the Euro is too weak (compared to it's management policy)!

Everyone,

Under recent circumstances; using the dollar as a trade reserve it was the policy of all CBs to save most of their positive foreign exchange. This was in an ongoing defense of their domestic currencies value. We must grasp that just saving the excess trade reserves constituted active dollar support.

Simply put, when a nation state does a good job of manufacturing and runs a balance of trade surplus they are receiving more dollars in trade. This mandated a dollar surplus in their economy's banking system from where more local moneys were printed against those saved reserves. In other words, if you're trade positive you are supporting dollar values by default. But why save dollars as a reserve?

In the good old days; when our country (USA) printed too much money and that money overflowed it's borders as buying power, the selling of that excess currency by our trading partners (lowering it's value) to balance trade differences would force the printing nation (US) to slow down it's money creation. If they didn't, price inflation in the domestic (US) market would begin to catch up and reflect said overprinting of the money. So far, so good.

Today; if our (USA) trading partners allowed those dollars to flow back into the world markets (actively buying their local currency with dollars) this action raised the exchange value of their currency and penalized the international pricing structure of their goods. Their goods would cost more and slow down their exports. Yet, if your currency management is strong (as the Euro's is) and your people (read that economy) work better than their foreign US competitors, the exchange rate system shouldn't hurt your goods pricing! But, it does. You see, selling these extra dollars today would have the effect of hurting a competitive producer that has good money management. But this is not the way our dollar system was supposed to work!

It's not a situation where your currency should get stronger if you're doing a good job. It's the other currency (dollar) that should get weaker because they are doing a bad job! In this a "Western Style World where "the dollar market system's" trading price was seen as the only real price for anything" (see my last post below),,,,,,,,,, the currency doing a bad job can and is manipulated to higher values than their manage policy should dictate.

But it is the over printer that should have been forced to slow down because of their policy of currency inflation (not the under printer). If you are a "Positive" trading partner of the US, your exports should slow because the US is sending less dollars out to buy things from you internationally. In this dynamic your competitive pricing structure should remain the same even as USA demand for your goods slows.

Again, the whole reason this all worked backwards stems from the US's ability to manipulate it's dollar value through currency and gold derivatives, even as our dollar has super inflated it over the years. If we (as US citizens) can see this happening, think how foreigners see it? Our interest rates are way under where this money printing should have them. Our domestic economy is swollen fat with hyper spending for any and all forms of ancillary, nonessential goods. Yet the real US prices we all pay comes nowhere close to reflecting this money creation (I'm talking real life pricing today, not the government CPI). Debt creation (the machine of dollar creation) is surging as our domestic economy runs away on goods priced low by foreign exchange rates.

If this is not bad enough, who wants to hold their neighbors debt as a wealth reserve? More from my "old bones":

==============================================

I believe the most difficult part in understanding the modern gold market is overcome by seeing all the various political factions involved. Essentially and basically, the largest pro gold groups are those who want a world currency that is not subject to the performance of the American economy. At this moment and in this period of economic history, all currency reserves held by foreigners (non-Americans) is a debt of the US Government and by extenuation through tax collection, a debt based on the ability of the American economy to function profitability!

In essence, America has told the world that as long as the business of this country is functioning, your wealth, as represented in Marks, Yen, Pesos, etc. is backed with performing US debt. It's like saying, "as long as your neighbor, next door, does not loses his job, you will not lose all your money! Most people would be surprised at how clear this is, outside the USA sphere of influence. This, the largest of the pro gold group, is largely made up of countries with economies that have no need to sell most of their production to the US. The business of these communities would not totally fail without the American engine. Yes, they would slow down, but not collapse, as trade with other countries would continue. To add what was said before: If your neighbor loses his job, you can still trade with the other people in the town, as long as the currency system is not based on your neighbors debts!

This group, made up of much of Europe and the Middle East, is not looking for a return to the old Gold Standard, but perhaps something far better. They do not see any advantage in holding the currency bonds of one country, as a reserve asset of future payment, over holding physical gold as a reserve asset in full payment. The fact that the debt reserve asset pays interest is little more than a joke in these banking circles. Any paper currency, the dollar included, can fall in exchange value against your local currency far more than the interest received! In today's paper markets, the only true value in exchange reserves, held by a government as currency backing, is found in it's effectiveness for defending the local currency from falling against other currencies. In other words, use the reserves to buy your countries money. But, this is a self defeating action as sooner or later the reserves are used up! This fact is not lost on many, many countries around the world, as they watch their currencies plunge, lacking reserves as defense. Ask them how important the factor of earning interest on reserves is under these conditions.

====================================================

Looking down the trail:

This is where the ECB is offering a different currency animal to combat our failing monetary order.

By not selling dollars to buy Euros, they are making an end run around the exchange system no other currency has had the option of doing. Think about it. The dollar reserves they hold are really worthless in a new currency system. If their Euro is as Duisenberg puts it, a new reserve for Europe, not the world; they don't need dollars or the buying value they represent. A super hyperinflation can take the dollars value to zero and the ECB will lose nothing. It already has it's dollar reserves in the form of Euros and gold.

Using the logic above; if they don't use reserve dollars to bid the Euro exchange rate above it's domestic pricing structure, the dollar system has no alternative but to slow itself down through competitive default. With nothing to stop it, through such a default the dollar will be force hyper inflated in a real world act. That dynamic will lower it's exchange rates. For good!

So how will the ECB give further backing to it's currency? Back to the burial tree:

===================

On the other hand, buying gold on the open market, using your local currency, works as a far different dynamic from selling foreign bond\\reserves. This action takes physical gold off the market, and in doing so increases it's value in dollar terms. Gold is and always has been the chief competitor with the dollar for exchange reserve status. The advantage here comes from the fact that governments do not run out of local currencies to use in buying gold, as opposed to selling foreign currency reserves to buy the local currency on the open market. Of course, the local price of gold goes sky high, however, in this action you are seen as taking in reserves, not selling them off.

Also, as gold begins to rise against the dollar, the local gold reserves are seen as assets of increasing value, backing the local currency. Under these conditions, with a stable currency, citizens will purchase more gold as it is seen as a positive asset. Not unlike a rising stock, everyone wants an increasing investment. Contrast this action against that in Korea, where everyone sold gold as it increased in an unstable currency!

==============================

Let's consider

To those that think the ECB lacks the resolve to do this, just have a look at the exchange rates of the German Mark against the dollar. Between 1979 to date, the Mark had one instance where it lost 45% against the dollar. I submit that if the Mark and/or Germany didn't fail from that experience, this Euro and all of Euroland will not fade away from a little 20%+ fall we see today. From a recent Mr.Wim Duisenberg comment; "Weakness of euro is not one of the "exceptional circumstances" that would justify intervention" !

Indeed, it was the US that first initiated the accords in 1985 that broke the dollar's high value. They were worried then but there was no alternative currency to work against them. They are trapped now.

Today, the ECB can use not only it's excess dollars to buy physical gold sold from other banks, they could use Euros printed outright to buy physical spot delivery. If their currency continues to fall before the dollar begins it's terminal phase, this option is wide open to them. Certainly, "Free Gold" is not going to compete against them as it would against the dollar because it's their policy to mark all it's rise to the market. Because Free Gold will not be an official currency, it's wealth building power will compliment the bank's reserves. In addition, national citizens would own gold as a wealth savings, not a currency.

More from our diggings:

=========
Basically, this is the direction the Euro group is taking us. This concept was born with little regard for the economic health of Europe. In the future, any countries money or economy can totally fail and the world currency operation will continue. What is being built is a new currency system, built on a world market price for gold.

==========

This takes us back to his recent large speech, Duisenberg said:
-----"First, the "euro project" is to be seen as a further logical step in the European integration process, which started more than half a century ago, immediately after the Second World War. Its objectives were not - and are still not - purely economic, as European integration aims not only at the creation of a prosperous but also a stable and peaceful Europe. For a large part, trade, economic and financial integration aimed at the removal of all barriers to free competition has been the engine of this process. In this context, the euro is to be seen as a major contribution to the completion of the Single Market in Europe.--------
I repeat, ----Its objectives were not - and are still not - purely economic----

Truly, a new world reserve currency in the making!

Further:

The present dollar overprinting (already in the system) is enough to force the US to further print in order to stop a cascading default. Again. this current dollar strength is killing it's trade and exploding the foreign exchange deficit. The final trigger for all this is in the prices of two international goods that are synonymous with real wealth, gold and oil.

Oil now doing it's two part thrust to drive the US into hyper status. Thus ending it's reserve roll for good. High oil prices are forcing the trade deficit to alarming, derivative busting levels. In addition, these same oil prices will completely break the ability of American goods to be priced competitively. At some point our domestic economy will roll over and the above mentioned cascading defaults will begin. Rather than raising local interest rates to slow our dollar flood (as the fed would do in the past) they will, like Japan drive rates to almost zero. All in a mad attempt to save the system and keep the world away from Euros. It will not work.

Contrary to what many hard money advocates expect, In such an atmosphere the dollar / gold market and it's gold banking system will completely fail. As part of the current dollar derivative system, a hyper inflating US price structure will fracture the credibility of paper gold. The paper gold prices we watch every day will go directly to the floor!

Just as in every inflation in history, credibility only goes so far. Then it's time to settle up. Trading volume on the world paper gold market is now falling away just as paper gold derivative supply is driving ahead. Truly, even a corporation cannot continue to get away with issuing more stock privately as public trading dries up. In the same light paper gold derivatives are being inflated as volume slows. In the end it's pricing structure that always fails. Today this paper gold price continues down into market failure. At some point, a full "Free Gold" physical market will appear and it will be used by the ECB to support the Euro Banks with a super high free gold price. This is something Physical Gold Advocates know is coming.

The ECB is going to support gold in a major way. They may be doing so now through the BIS sales of Swiss gold but none of this will break into the open until the dollar begins it's inflation and it's derivatives fail.

As all of this is going on, inflation in Europe will more than likely bring their trade status with the US to an even neutral basis. But by then, the Euro (through comparison) will have become the candidate as a leading reserve currency holding worldwide. Not only will the ECB be buying gold with dollars, so too will any other positive traders with the US. Most everyone will be asked to use Euros to buy oil and the oil producers will be buying gold hand over fist with excess dollars.

Right around here, the ECB will begin buying dollar reserves from other CBs. Of course using Euros. It will be seen as a defense of the dollar, but by then such an action will be just a political ploy.

Ok, let's place this little guy back into the ground under our burial tree. We will meet here next time to see how these oil for gold deals will benefit the further expansion of Euro use.

We do live in exciting times for Physical Gold owners. Exciting times.

Happy B-Day USAGOLD!


This forum has covered a lot of ground during it's time. But in an off take from a famous saying;

---we have miles to go before we sleep--- (smile)

Talk about good words; when reading ORO (9/18/2000; 5:53:59MT - usagold.com msg#: 36874)

I am reminded of another great thinker that said
---give me a place to stand and I can move the world-----

Of course that original thought was referring to physical leverage. ORO's post is the kind of solid rock from where Another places his wealth building pry - bar. Very few will gain from using such a bar in real life, because one has to have a heap of mass behind it. Oil is that mass that's
moving the paper fraud into the open! ORO, you have said it all in that post.

ALL;
I am close to distilling a lot of input and am about to start replying to some of the comments and questions sent my way. In today's markets we are trully seeing "leverage in action".

Another pre hike talk at the trail head (as a warm up)

----------
In my view, the only people that see the Euro as weak are the ones with a clouded Western Perception. I own a large portion of my currency in dollars. But they aren't held for investment, rather just plain old money / risk diversity.

In addition, my Euros once made up almost the same amount of cash held as Dollars Prior to EMU my foreign fiat was in the form of several European moneys and some Yen. After EMU I allowed all of that portion to be slowly converted into Euros. About 1/3 went off initially and the rest followed over time. Once the Euro exchange rate drifted to the .90 area I began shifting more of my dollars to Euros. (of course physical gold is my largest holding along with several other assets) Today, the Euro makes up some 80% of the currency mix.

Why shift into a weak Euro or hold Euros at all?

Well, mostly because I don't see or value these cash assets the way Western traders do. Nor do I hold them in the form of derivatives, looking for a trading profit. As large as these assets may be, I do expect to eventually spend them for something real some day.

With this position and viewpoint I don't have to "buy into" the "Euro is weak" trading talk distributed around various forums and trading houses. I don't have too because I can compare, "first hand" the relative values of these two currencies (or at least others can do it for me). By relative I mean their native buying power . In Europe, prices of a large basket of "LOCAL" goods have not gone up in price the same 30% +/- the Euro exchange rate has changed against the dollar. Conversely, the price of US goods produced natively have not fallen 30% to reflect the dollars gained strength. It's that simple.

Notice how we word this money comparison; it's an exchange rate, not a value comparison rate! Most Western traders consider the exchange rate to be the value, but it's not. Spending the paper money in it's local economy is the value rate.

To continue my logic I repeat an item from our last trail walk:

----- The ECB and Duisenberg have it right. ------- It's the dollar that's too strong (compared to it's management policy), not the Euro is too weak (compared to it's management policy)! --------

OK; with that understanding we can grasp why I am selling dollars (real dollar holdings, not derivatives) for more Euros. The fact is that, for a bunch of reasons the dollar went up in it's exchange rate against the Euro. It did so even though the real value of these currency's "buying power" did not become an issue, rather the manipulated exchange rate did.

This process alone created the gain in my dollar holdings. I see it as no different than buying a stock in America that rises over a year or so. No, the dollar (Euro concept) didn't fall against the stock (dollar concept), it's the stock (dollar concept) that went up in value. So we sell the stock (the dollar) to retain profits! Just as most American tech stock's trading price does not reflect their fundamental worth and value, so too does the Dollar exchange rate not reflect it's true fundamental pricing value.

Further; if an across the board price inflation was raging in Europe and not in the USA, the situation would be different. But it's not.

Also; who is fooling who here with this (Friday) currency intervention? Exactly which currency power block in under the worst stress and pressing for help (in the background)? Our Western Media gives us all the details of Europe's oil and other problems but perhaps 1/10 the coverage is given to the US trade hemorrhage. Any damn fool can see that this trade deficit is the result of a currency being manipulated and squeezed up for reasons that are uneconomic. USAGOLD poster ORO explained this dynamic many times.

Prior to EMU the dollar was expanded (thru debt creation) at levels never before thought allowable or possible. But all of that debt creation in conjunction with it's demands for that future debt service is spiking the dollar "exchange rate" as Euro financing competes with Dollar financing. In other words, on the world stage converting dollar debt into more favorable Euro debt shrinks the dollar liquidity pie. As this happens, our Euro value (in relative local buying power) stay's almost the same even as the dollar exchange rate rises against the Euro.

Again; it's the dollar that's caught in a vice because it's exchange value is rising while it's native buying power is somewhat the same. In order to balance the dollar's strength, native goods prices should be falling. By staying the same, it's effects on our exchange rate process makes the local price of US goods ever more noncompetitive to sell to world markets. I think Intel is but only one large operation that just recently demonstrated how this works against our US economy.

This very dynamic creates a massive demand for Euro priced goods from outside their borders. Left on it's own, such a process would expose the dollar structure to the bankrupt / hyper inflated position it has been in for many years. The US trade deficit would grow until the flow of dollars destroys our dollar reserve system. From where I swim in the ocean (in deep water), this is exactly the unending process we have embarked on. This time it will not reverse.

Better said, the US has been forced into such an inflation by the existence of a new possible reserve currency. Something our money policy has never had to contend with before.

Further:

Go back a read the most recent speeches and comments by the ECB president, Mr. Duisenberg. Truly, the ECB is not interested in "crashing" the system, rather let's "transition" the system into a more fair order. If intervention is needed, it's needed to keep the American economy from failing too fast from the coming hyperinflation of it's currency. If the ECB is worried about the "exchange rate" being too far out of whack, it a worry about it's effect in generating a dollar system meltdown from deficit trade. Not a total failure of the Euro as so many report. When the time comes, and it will; the dollar will begin it's fall away from it's own past policy failure. Until that time, for the benefit of oil producers and many others, let's move as far down this Euro / gold trail as possible. Without a breakdown.

The very existence of a Euro today makes oil policy in America as never before. One way or Another oil production control is going to expose the "best" system for future use. The one that most values and allows real wealth pricing in currency terms. The first system that allows the price of physical gold to rise will see it's currency price of oil fall. Yet, a rising physical gold price is something the dollar cannot and will not live with. The American and world gold market trading system is going to fail with this currency transition and that prospect will leave some high profile gold owners high and dry. It will also leave some very smart physical and paper gold traders with a real wealth holding Western traders never will understand. You see, in our day, in our time oil and gold will never flow in the same direction. Both price wise and physical wise.

Many American / Western order proponents will always take a nationalist side when writing about the Dollar's position. I think it's called "spinning" the details. Yet, in today's evolving money system, it's the dollar that under stress from a trade deficit dynamic. We shall see!

Let's hike back to the burial tree we visited last week. There we can re dig some "old bones"!

Hello USAGOLD!

That Mundell is something. When reading his speeches I almost feel like I have talked to him before. (smile)

My take on his latest (in your post) is that the gold coin part is a trial balloon. This isn't the first time we have driven in this direction. So, it's not the real end story. I always knew the Euro concept would eventually contain a gold Euro. But getting it past the crowd would take some doing,
indeed.

They may try to peg it's value in Euros initially, but the thrust will be to issue it as a Market Gold Euro. Perhaps it's name will be what you, Aristotle and myself would call a "Free Gold" Euro. I know this discussion will fly in the face of every past hard money thinker, but it not only will work, it will happen. We must watch this closely.

As I understand it, the SPR draw-down is actually a swap in that at some (undetermined?) time inthe future, the refiners will have to replenish the inventories they took, presumably at the lower prices expected in the future. -------------


Hello JavaMan,

That's the way I read it too. In fact, it almost sounds like some sort of oil lending? Kind of like paper oil? Let's see; the oil is really there in the SPR but only in IOU form ,,,,,, like gold lent from a CB. No?

I can just hear the producers getting all excited at the prospects of us draining our last line of defense. I bet poster "Oldgold" is even wondering why the USA,,,,,, with all his reporting of American influence over the ME oil producers,,,,,, is now resorting to such an obvious weak ploy!

My take is that something else is exerting more pressure on our "political will" than the usual arm twisting can overcome. We pointed out on the trail and here that the Euro presence makes pricing concessions the norm. We shall see!

Our friend Goldhunter (good poster here) will learn soon enough how a rising physical gold price will make the free market in contract gold fall apart also.

Hello Buena Fe!

I'm happy you are coming to terms with all of this. It's a real broad thing to get one's mind around. Yes, we will all,,,,, in our time "ride these winds of change"!

As in all political conflicts, the actual timing of the event is impossible. The actions can indeed be there and also out of sight,,,,, but the other side must also make a choice to react to these events either in the open or out of sight. Nothing spills into public view until all the jockeying is exhausted.

I personally know the now year old Washington Agreement as an public showing that one part of the contest was now exhausted. In other words, we were as I said then "on the road to high priced gold"! But nothing happened right then. Indeed, that spike was nothing compared to what could
have happened.

We as free agents must take this time frame to prepare for the time when an uncontrollable spike closes the dollar paper gold markets for good. I would say this is in the pipeline but when will it spill out?

Trail Guide...good to hear from you! You said...

"...the oil is really there in the SPR but only in IOU form."

------------------------

Ha! Ha! JavaMan I know that oil is there now (as we speak). But, if they start draining it this time, I doubt it will ever, ever be replaced again. The US knows the oil pricing dynamics have and are changing today. Truly, fundamental supply and demand was never the driving force. Real payment
for oil was!

We have made a mistake in deciding to inflate the paper gold currency supply like it was a fiat. Today, without Europe's gold backing, that American portion of paper no longer can control the dollar pricing of oil! Mainly because paper gold is held in the same memory banks of minds that knew 1971. This play will not be performed again!

FOA. . .
Your comment: "When reading his speeches I almost feel like I have talked to him before."

Maybe because the logic looks familiar? I've often wondered about the same ideas coming to largenumbers of people at the same time. You see it all the time -- even in considerably soft scienceslike political economy not to speak of the highly disciplined hard sciences. I think it is because
shared knowledge and analysis logically leads people to similar conclusions. Sorry..........I drift .........

----------------------
I never thought of that as drifting. Sounds more like thinking (smile).
-----------------------
Your post:

-----------
If you were to go pure Rothbard (and FOA) on this thing, the coin would not be marked with a currency value, but I always have had trouble with that because, practically speaking, how do you use such a coin in day to day transactions. I can just imagine going to the scooter shop to buy
transportation and having to get a calculator out, call the gold broker, etc. to determine how many ounces of gold it would take to complete the transaction.

--------------------

Well MK, try thinking of it as a internationally secure asset you don't use for transactions. Consider; how many assets we all hold and think of as our wealth savings? Yet none of us can spend them as a currency? Stocks, real estate, oil reserves, rare pictures, antiques, violins (Strad Master (smile)? You go through life with some idea of how many cars your house could buy,,,,, how many violins
your IBM shares could bring,,,,, but never the exact amount without a quote. Why some people even own millions in 30 year bonds,,,,, an actual currency debt,,,,, but only have an idea of it's tradable worth because of market changes.

All of these items form part of our wealth and are just as much spend able and tradable as any digital currency. But first one must convert a portion (or all) of them into a modern digital transactional currency before spending. So why not hold gold the way it was always intended; not
as an officially denominated currency but as an officially declared savings asset ,,,,,, and be as a part of our real wealth in coin form?

Think further back. Back into the time of your earliest rare coins. These gold coins were the actual currency, but no one knew the street market for gold? When Marcus went into his Roman scooter shop did he know the gold price? Even if these official coins were a "gold coin of the Roman Empire equal to 25 denarii", he did not know the value of a denarius unit. No, he just knew how much weight in gold it would take to make his purchase. This many tiny coins of so much gold
weight. It's tradable value was not in the denarii, rather it was in the scooter.

A gold asset has a moving value whether it's denominated in currency units or not. That's because the value in gold comes from how much weight it takes to trade for anything else,,,,, and in real life everything else is always changing in value from our human demand.

Even deeper; again,,,,, if gold is used as a currency it has no fixed value even if denominated in so many units of the realm,,,,,, because the value of everything is always in a state of change,,,,, Therefore, official Gold value must not be fixed if it is to be worth saving as an asset. Us hard money types always promote the history example of how gold kept everything so stable. Yet, everything was always in a state of value evolution, even in gold terms.

I hope I'm not drifting alone here (smile).

From your post:
-------------------------------
But when you go on this line of reasoning, you are confronted with a major question:

What would EU put as a currency value on that one ounce gold coin? Now that's something to think about. . . . . If you do not put a currency value on it, you make exchange risk a factor in every transaction. I don't think that's what Mundell has in mind, though I could easily be wrong on that.

Am I missing something here, FOA? Each method provides its unique advantages and disadvantages.
-------------------------------------

But Michael, exchange risk is inherent in everything we own. Only a currency system that can recognize and base itself on the flexible nature of gold value can survive in the long run. As a high speed, modern, global trading society we are not going to drive digital currencies away because gold is becoming more valuable. If that were the case we would already be using stock certificates to buy our groceries (grin). FreeGold will allow us to use the timeless traits of gold wealth to protect ourselves from currency inflation.

From your post:
----------------
I'm with you all the way on this being a trial balloon. I think there are those in Europe who know what it's going to take to overcome the euro's problems and what better way to float the gold euro idea than through a Nobel Prize winner who happens to know what he's talking about. In the recent
interview of Judy Shelton (another economist I admire) by Robert Novak, she mentioned that gold was going to make a comeback as the international arbiter of value because it is the only true international money -- money without a country, as I have said before. She said gold was perfect
for the direction the world was going -- breaking down international trade barriers, etc.
----------------

Yes, I think we are well on the way to using gold as an international free asset in monetary affairs. The difference this time is that the next reserve currency has learned to use gold in the same way we have,,,,,,,, by allowing it to protect their system from political tinkering. Rather than use gold to force responsible currency creation through currency denomination of it's weight (something that
history has shown will always fail),,,,,, FreeGold will make the very best meter to indicate currency inflation. A meter for all to see!

-------------
again, your post:
---------

Another thought, FOA. . .

Either way, wouldn't adopting such a proposal virtually put an end to gold sales and leases out of Europe? Perhaps the Washington Agreement was Prelude?? Talk about logic. . .

ORO is Right! The second part of ORO's # 37224 covers "EURO Intervention" today by the U.S. FED, BOJ and ECB.It's Right On!

Well my guess it was to try to show the Group of 7 (G-7) meeting tomorrow in Prague that "We(U.S. FED/BOJ)have things under control." Because, if they(FED) hadn't taken this action today, the G-7 would have devalued the U.S.Dollar by a much larger percentage at the end of their meeting. We watch together.....beesting.

------------

Hello Beesting,

In a way I echoed ORO's nice post in my trail talk today. Truly, it's the dollar that must fall and do it in Euro terms. Our present situation is in no way comparable to past dollar problems. Our US policy must now be one of intervention as raising interest rates to a degree that would work will not be allowed.

This will be the last inflation, my friend. The last and the longest! We will find that in time all our markets will reflect this with rising prices and changing terms of trade.

If we think the G-7 cannot be maneuvered, just look at what they did to the dollar in 1985. Then it was the Yen that was so low it somewhat threatened the US. Yet, the Yen was nothing compared to the Euro Project, especially when one considers that ME oil is what helped shape it. Yes, the political will was Old Europe and BIS to the core, but oil is what made it so.

Further:
England recognized this and began making conditions to join EMU even though their public is negative. That's because they only have half the story. Britain is selling it's gold in such a strange format so as to somewhat bail out a few of it's favorite gold players. But only a few will make it.
Most of them will be eaten as the London / American gold markets evaporate. Can you imagine the Brits thinking in Euros? Ha! Ha! I have to live long enough to see this!

Swiss Gold Sales
This question is respectfully asked of FOA, but however I would appreciate anyone who would address it (and perhaps it has been addressed before, if so forgive me). What is the motivation of the Swiss to divest themselves of so much gold?

--------------

Hello da2g,

They are also doing some of the same maneuvers as the British (as stated below). But, as I understand it,,,,, that gold is also flowing in a round about way into the ECB system,,,,,, for Euros. The BIS (as the official selling broker) has many ways of moving gold between CBs without it ever being on the books. I think we will all see more of this gold trail once the dollar really begins it's fall.
Then,,,, every official gold owner in the world will be proclaiming their ownership of this bullion that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

We da2g, must accept that eventually the Swiss will become part of the Euro system. Perhaps they will enter in some two tier market plan? I don't know yet, but they will be very hurt without some form of membership. To this end their gold will best work for them if it's under ECB control in an
EMCB format. We shall see.

You put the story together, again, all in one place. I'm amazed at your patience in doing so for us, but each time I think a little more sticks to my synapses.

Question: What have the oil producers been doing with their excess dollars since early '99's oil rise? Were they still bought off by paper gold deals? Or, not really in a hurry, they could wait to phase out of those and buy physical longer-term? Or did some of them have dollar debt to work out of first, in the process of paying off now?

How cynical are they? How much pressure is put on them in other ways to give the dollar more time? Why are they so patient, so far?

In other words, why didn't physical get a jolt from them before now?

Well, I was just about to post your item. Had copied it from that day. You know, their fuel prices are changing faster than ours so some of that looks wrong. The oldest rates are OK and well before EMU, but overall,,,,,, over time the comparison is good.

But actually, PH,,, because the dollar has risen against the Euro Zone native currencies and the Euro itself, these rates indicate more of a recent uptrend in fuel costs for them (convert it back to Euros at today's rates). This is the only area where local costs have gone up in line with the dollar's appreciation. Yet, if the G-7 is forced to take the dollar back to Euro par, then their total basket will look very good compared to ours.

Their fuel prices are way higher than ours and always have been. I think you know this, your people are in Spain, no? On the surface, we must understand the uproar in Europe over fuel costs is mostly from exchange rate adjustments that are on top of rising dollar crude prices. If oil is settled
in Euros all this will change dramatically!

Do you recall your comment about the KRand and stating that because there was no currency value indicated on the coin, "they've already taken care of that"?

------------

Hello Cavan Man

Yes, that is part of the reason. They had to have "thought long and Hard" on that aspect because FreeGold was but a distant Thought then.

The other is the Legal Tender problem we also discussed. While I'm not concerned with official gold confiscation, the US and it's Australian / Canadian partners may call in all their Legal Tender in some form of currency exchange. Most of our modern Western gold is "Legal Tender"! . For this
reason alone, especially when things get rough one should have brought some of the old coins. K-Rands are better than local bullion but a better mix would include a bunch of the old fractional coins. Or at least begin building on them now.


But, as a further point:

I would not suggest to anyone that they wait for the Euro gold coin before buying gold. That would be some mistake, indeed! Gold will most likely be in the thousands before they come out. Even then, a limited manufacturing capacity may limit them to Euro Zone circulation for years. It may truly be a master stroke for MK to be operating in Europe. Looking down the road and thinking out loud,,,,,,,, CPM may be one of the few dealers that could offer these new items back into the US???? You never know how things will turn out.

Thanks for reading Cavan Man

----do you see Alan Greenspan agreeing to "play ball" now for the greater global good after having been the beneficiary of many fixed innings? Or does he believe the dollar can yet be salvaged? Or does he have no choice in the matter but to put on a brave face against the inevitable (in which case, again, "playing ball" would seem the appropriate course of action)?-----------

This nation is changing,,,,, has changed and will never again be the place he knew. How could his policies ever undo all the wrong our debt has brought and paid for and still pay off our debt?

As strong as the Federal Reserve's purpose is/was, we,,,, as a nation have tied their hands with our own doings. Blaming it on the banks and the Fed is a nice way out,,,,, but the fathers of this generation and this generation itself have built our undoing by believing the bookkeeping lies they
were told. A simple person knows we cannot spend ourselves rich, but then we do not think ourselves simple,,,,, do we?

Yes Aristotle, he will play ball now. Just to keep us out of harms way a while longer. No longer is the dollar system something to salvage, it's just become something to manage to a lesser end.


Thank you and everyone here for this time. As Another always said:

Hello Everyone:

You know, it was only a short time ago that the smart money was telling us how the Euro would never be born. It was.

When it was born, it ran to 1.17+/-. Everyone (including the ECB) got real quiet wondering it something was wrong. You see, we now know the ECB just wanted a par (1.00) opening against the dollar. The whole game plan was never to see Euro strength this early on. I expected things may have been worse than we knew then and prepared to be "off to the races". Never the less, to my relief, the Euro soon returned to par as the currency's usage grew over the next many months. We can listen to all the trader types tell us how much it has fallen, but the reality is that price inflation in that group of nations has not justified any exchange rate drop. If anything is striking about all this it's that no one clarifies why a basket of Euro interest rates are always lower than the dollar rates? If indeed the Euro is so weak why does this secaond largest world currency command a lower lending rate? We don't hear anyone working that into the value equation. At .88 today, has the Euro really fallen? It hasn't. The dollar has gone up.

Then the traders were telling us the Euro would never be backed by gold. Or the ECB would never hold and treat gold as a monetary reserve like all the other currencies they own. In fact, today they not only hold gold as a reserve, they mark it to market quarterly. By placing gold in such a
prominent position, it does truly back the Euro every bit as much as any US dollars it holds. But traders don't have a clue what would make this so? Soon after the Euro Project started, the IMF set a new precedent by receiving gold as payment for dollar debt. This very action repositioned the
ECB gold reserve assets for later use. Whether traders think it does or not, gold is backing the Euro today? It does.

Now the Danish vote comes up and it's suddenly neck and neck. Once again the Western trading community was wrong, early on by saying the vote was completely lopsided against EMU. Whether the Danish say yes or no, clearly this Euro cat has nine lives as it's momentum continues to build. But it's a dead currency that can't survive, say the traders! Yep, that's right,,,,, these guys told us that before!

Now out of a clear blue sky, one of the oil producing countries is turning to the Euro for oil payment. Funny how that is coming up right before the big OPEC meeting in South America. Euros, gold, oil,,,,,, almost sounds like these things are tying together. But the traders said this was
all a bunch of bull,,,,,,,, does anyone still listen to the logic of a trading mentality?

A lot of policy is going to be made over the next month or so. We have said many times, this new gold market is about a war between Dollars and Euros. Watch only as dollars battle gold and you will miss 90% of the action. Our dollar paper gold market is going to lay waste to the assets of a lot
of paper gold players. Listen to the traders and it should be clear,,,,,, they don't see this one either!

ALL:

As I said in some of my other writings, the valley between physical gold owners and paper gold substitute owners is going to grow. In the environment that's coming this is almost a given. As this new gold market evolves and progresses, paper players will fall behind because their leverage will be failing them. This is nothing new and has been in process for some time.

I watched Another's Thoughts tell the paper crowd long ago how they should hold their wealth in this changing market. He received the very same cacophony for paper we hear here today! The same outdated explanations based on using tools engineered from past experience. It's the same call from the wild, "these positions worked then so they should work this time"!

Gold options, futures, mine shares, etc. were all touted as something the smart money could trade in and out of, well ahead of the curve. It seemed to carry a silent message then and now that only the slow, dumb ones brought gold. Dumb indeed!

For the last several years these sharp paper players all used the same outdated tools to read what was quickly becoming a very new market dynamic. Their tools failed to trade then out of harm's way. I watched as most were cleaned out in the mining share game not to mention all the other
leverage plays. No, not everyone lost 50%. It was more like 60% to 70%+! But we don't hear about these slick trades, do we?

When we come to these forums it's important for lurkers to know the difference between our perspectives.

Hard money advocates (such as I) are positioning their assets for preservation. Their reasoning is based on the politics of currency use and it's changing dynamic. Because today's dynamic is so far out of balance, asset preservation in the form I advocate (long term building of physical gold) will also produce massive wealth gains.

Paper gold traders are leveraging their assets to create more wealth. Their reasoning is based on anything that makes their leverage work. Being short as well as long. Often they will promote the same dynamic as hard money advocates and assume it will also work equally in their leveraged
position. They feel they have the power to trade between the news.

For lurkers observing this, I submit that the loses taken by paper gold traders so far are alone enough to discourage new position in their arena. I also point out that in spite of the heavy loses to date, these paper traders will take many others with them on their ride. Mostly because both old
and new investors have not taken the time to learn how this new market is leveraging the paper game into the physical gold owner's favor.

Preservation or Leverage, Physical or Paper,,,,,,, they are not the same in this new game. Events will prove this correct. One side will bring wealth and profits while the other will bring busted leverage and loses. From what mountain will you watch the valley grow wide?

"time will prove all things" Another

-----The Invisible Hand (09/28/00; 03:46:21MT - usagold.com msg#: 37741)Marking to market ----------

Hello Invisible Hand,
Ever since the world left the gold exchange standard in 71 the rules covering reserves behind currencies has been changing. Each change has brought us further and further away from using gold as an asset. The ECB has taken a new direction. Their new thrust has not only been to keep gold
as a reserve asset (as allowed by current IMF rules) but to acknowledge it's market value. This is in direct conflict with our dollar policy of marking gold to a fictitious market of $45 to the ounce.

Holding gold "at market" creates a new dynamic that supports the Euro currency as gold rises. This new asset can now be used to pay debts (IMF precident), create more Euros against or hold for further future use. Contrast this against holding a foreign reserve currency (the dollar) that, if it rises in a fashion like
today hurts your import price structure because everything is settled in dollar prices. But gold, unlike fiat currencies is an international world reserve without a country of origin. It can rise in value without the dual conflict of mandatory usage in international trade and reserve storage.

By taking this course, the ECB is staying within the rules and breaking them at the same time. The only way the dollar / gold reserve system can function is by retaining the current price retarding paper gold trading. As we have discussed endlessly, breaking and destroying the IMF / dollar / LBMA price making structure will leave only a physical market. That new market will soar in Euro support leaving the dollar politically trapped in it's current reserve structure.

This is the reason we continue to advance investor understanding of the risk in paper gold. Even though most Western players have built their positions by using all forms of paper leverage, it's this very paper house that's about to fall. Carrying away the dreams of many.

Also:

ALL: OPEC is very much together these days. On Wednesday Saudi Arabia offered to pump more but indirectly tied it's offer to reductions in local taxes on crude products. Let's see how the West spins this one?

OPEC Blames Rich World Tax for Costly Fuel

By Tom Ashby

CARACAS (Reuters) - OPEC (news - web sites) heads of state laid the blame for high oil prices squarely on industrialized nations on Thursday and said debt was a greater threat to the world's poor than expensive fuel.

Leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries strongly denied they were endangering world economic growth and pointed the finger instead at fuel taxation in the developed world.

\`\`OPEC is not blackmailing anyone. OPEC is not a cause of poverty in the world,'' said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, the host of a summit celebrating the cartel's 40th birthday.

\`\`It is the horrific, diabolical world economic system that is to blame ... The debt burden is a greater hindrance to development than the high oil price.''

The Saudi-dominated exporter group is under pressure from consuming nations across all continents to boost oil supplies and provide some relief to escalating energy bills.

But an OPEC declaration issued as the summit drew to a close said fuel taxes that provide key revenues for Western governments were doing most damage to consumers' pocketbooks.

\`\`Excessive taxation on petroleum products accounts for the highest share of the final price to the consumers in the major consuming countries,'' the so-called Caracas Declaration said.

It said major consuming nations should consider reducing fuel taxes for the benefit of their citizens and world growth.

OPEC would aim to supply oil at fair and stable prices, while boosting cooperation with non-OPEC producers and consuming countries to try to steady the market, said the declaration read by OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman.

Chavez, promoting the cartel as a Third World champion, said a recent oil price spike had been driven by financial speculation, problems in the oil refining business and unjust terms of trade.

\`\`We have relaunched OPEC, a united OPEC for all the world to see,'' said Chavez, who helped end a price slump last year by coordinating output with Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Mexico.

The 11-nation group accounts for two-thirds of internationally traded crude oil and 40 percent of world crude production. It holds the vast majority of world oil reserves.

The declaration made no mention of sanctions, a key concern for members such as Iran, Iraq and Libya, seen by Washington as pariah states for alleged support of what it calls terrorism.

The countries deny the charge and experts argue world oil output could be up to two million barrels per day (bpd) higher were it not for the curbs on their oil industries.

Iraq Wanted Opec To Denounce Sanctions

Iraq had proposed the declaration denounce U.N. sanctions imposed after it invaded fellow-OPEC member Kuwait in 1990.

Delegates have said this was resisted by several OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia, which has been at odds with Baghdad ever since the invasion. A U.S.-led alliance based in Saudi Arabia ejected Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991.

OPEC did speak up on the environment and foreign debt, saying it wanted a more coordinated approach in international gatherings to easing the burden of heavily indebted nations.

\`\`The biggest environmental tragedy facing the globe is human poverty,'' it said.

OPEC President Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela said he was expecting contacts with the European Union before a November 17-18 producer-consumer conference in Riyadh which will see high level representation from the U.S. and the EU.

The West's energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency (IEA), has called an emergency meeting of its governing board on October 4 to discuss the world oil market.

The IEA groups 25 industrialized nations and is responsible for coordinating joint steps to meet oil supply emergencies.

France has called for a meeting between OPEC and EU countries hit by protests over high fuel taxes that provide a key revenue source for European governments.

This year's price spike has mainly been driven by fears of fuel shortages in the United States, which consumes a fifth of world oil. U.S. fuel inventories stand near 24-year lows.

Several European countries have consulted each other over the possibility of following Washington's lead and releasing strategic oil reserves to depress high prices.

Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, on Wednesday offered consumers an olive branch by declaring it stood ready to pump whatever volume would curb rampant prices.

But Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah urged industrialized nations to do their part by lowering taxes and said the cartel was being unjustly blamed for problems in the global economy.

Iraq stepped up verbal attacks on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in an apparent bid to block a big Kuwaiti Gulf War compensation claim debated this week in Geneva.

On Thursday the five permanent Security Council powers, in approving the Kuwaiti claim for $15.9 billion in compensation from Iraq, also agreed to reduce the rate of reparations Baghdad pays for the invasion.

Some oil traders had anticipated that Iraq might disrupt the market by withholding its crude exports if the Kuwaiti claim went through without any gesture toward Baghdad.

But Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan said on Thursday Iraq would not do that as it would not be in its own interests.

Iraq has frequently curtailed its own oil exports for at least several weeks between six-monthly phases of a U.N.- monitored Iraqi oil exchange.

The Greatest Conspiracy; It's Called life

We are planning later this month to have a nice dinner party for a few couples. I chose the wine to be the absolute best for complimenting each course. We spent hours and hours agonizing over the finest combinations of ingredients for our gourmet offering. The music will be perfect, lighting
adjusted just right and great conversation would engross the entire affair. All of this and for what end?

Yes, my wife and I are deep within a great conspiracy. With every intent it is our plan to entertain our guest and friends. With any luck we will pull this off and in the process show these good people an exceptionally fine time. Perhaps they will also leave here with a feeling that the evening was a success. Perhaps they will be happily that we twisted reality, changed the rules and generally created such an illusion for their benefit. I know we will enjoy it (smile)!

Such is this world of people we all are born into and live with today. It's normal and what we do. Humans conspire, plan and interact in an effort to manipulate the outcome of their life and the lives of others. We have been doing it from the beginning and will be doing it long after this present group is gone.

Whether the manipulation is with intent to gain for oneself, give to another or take from others, it is "THE dynamic" in our lives. There is little that any of us do either by ourselves or with a partner without conspiring for a preconceived outcome.

With this picture in mind it's easier for us "simple minded people" (yes I'm in that category) to understand how nothing in this life can be certain. Be it a law, a contract, a promise, an intent or just living life to death with a great deal of purpose; if humans are involved our plans end effects and that impact on others are always uncertain.

To this end I say "there is no such thing as integrity of contract"! From the days of our founding fathers and long before them, our dealings with each other are only as good as the last "settlement"! That's because no one rules the wind.

Most of us look for a "seasoned" mortgage before buying it (lending money?). We look for performance both past and present before entering an agreement (going over the books?). But our demands are in the present while we as people must perform against those requirements in the
future. And the future is always that dark space just ahead.

--------------

Hello miner49er,

We want to know who is going to win this game, don't we. Will it be Europe, China, the USA? Or will our oil producers walk away with the gold and then some? You know, it wasn't long ago that anyone even thought to ask questions along these lines (smile).

Do I know? No. I can only see their hands moving to the next chess player. One side places his hand on the knight while the other uses both hands to touch both queen and bishop. I know, that part is illegal. But in international power plays, rules are only good until someone else breaks them.
Then we are suddenly looking backwards at what history says the rules used to be.

What do I think? Well:

First, thanks for the Amen (smile) to my thoughts about Alan Greenspan I agree with you that he and most of our contemporary (American) politicians long ago inherited a lost cause in managing US monetary policy. We read endlessly where investors (and traders) try to explain away our
bankruptcy with something as simple as a change of money policy. Such reasoning usually grows from one's investment position that was taken prior to thinking.

It's like saying "my particular industry or market arena cannot fail, that's why I have an investment in it" (grin).

Using a logic that requires one to walk forward while looking backwards; they quickly gloss over our intense degeneration away from financial integrity. Then, just as quickly they slight the Europeans for such an add hock mix as the Euro Project. Truly, in reading and hearing these public pronouncements we have seen the enemy in ourselves. Our own reasoning becomes the very tools officials use to work the markets against us.

You asked me about gold confiscation. I am thinking that my view is often misconstrued with that of our host (Michael Kosares) on this issue. Actually it's more likely to be on somewhat the same level (that means i'm trying to catch up to him).

This country cannot possibly return to any semblance of a solid financial entity in out lifetime. Wading through all the thinking presented on both the internet and in the homes of major players, one cannot help but be struck by the loss of grasp for the gravity of the issue. It seems everyone is
betting we will have an "almost breakdown" someday in our system and positioning themselves for that occurrence. I think this is grounded in our perception that nothing else could take our place in the world power structure. But the history of fallen powers is all around us. Russia is a fine recent example.

This is the same attitude of "nothing can top us", also prevailed in England when the pound was king. Today, to prepare for anything of greater change than Britain underwent is to be placed in the "doomsday" camp. Yet, doomsday has escaped many countries that experienced these great inflations and power breakdowns.

If one only uses the recent bailouts of major banks and trading houses as an example and extrapolates such an action into a nation wide panic; we can clearly see how a full scale currency crisis could evolve. Something along the lines of a 1930 style banking shutdown is an almost
certainty. In addition, a complete currency recall (or remake if you will) could not be avoided in any twist of reality. We have to remember that this is coming in a context of having had, in the future the largest inflation this nation has ever seen.

I believe that "then", in a 180 degree turn from 1930s when gold was king, they will recognize gold at the value it would be trading at. Perhaps in the many, many thousands of dollars and thousands in Euros. Because the US will be the power experiencing international bankruptcy, the need to tie
gold to their currency would be utmost. In this process, they would call in all Legal Tender moneys for replacement. Modern gold bullion is in that official category. They will reissue both a gold backed fiat and copying Europe, a new gold coin.

Of course, the main agitation here is that the gold value at that time, in our modern eagles would not match what is contained in the new issues being created. Yes, I think most everyone would try to melt them down. But I bet that in that turmoil all sorts of restrictions and rules would be in place that work against an easy transition. Indeed, as I said in a thought appropriate for such a context in the future "I wouldn't have to outrun the government man, just out run you" (smile).

So, as you can see miner49er, my position isn't simply from an academic standpoint. Correct positioning requires that one should "conspire" to place their house of wealth in order today.

To do so is in keeping with the thrust and title of this post; being part of "The Greatest Conspiracy"!

Show Time!

Hello travelers!

In the world today it's looking more and more like our physical gold trail is the best place to be. Because it takes the "high road" above risk, we can watch the action with little fear of ending up with nothing. Indeed, we may end up with everything!

However, be ware, while hiking the physical trail it's easy for us to be confused with those on that other paper gold trail. When asked, "are you still hurting from exposure to gold substitute paper", I have to reply; "I'm sorry, you must have missed the climbers across the valley". "Yes I say, we can hear their problems over there, even far over on this side, but their gold is not like ours. Indeed, nor is their pain ours!

So often Western observers wonder, "why do so many "Giants" buy physical gold when it's going down"? Well, my friends, I'll use the same example we offered recently about the Euro; it's not that gold is going down so much as the dollar is being driven up in failure, and truly this end drive will be it's very last. We will not have to suffer this play much longer.

Look around the world and place yourself in many of it's other countries. Consider just how many of them have seen the dollar rise over recent years, say at least 30% against their local moneys. Yet, prior to this recent oil run, the actual cost and pricing structure of most American goods has not risen this same 30%+ within it's domestic market. No, I'm not making a case for the US CPI figures being correct, clearly they are not. But, the US has not even begun to enter it's real price inflation phase. A phase that brings to light our price inflation on a world scale.

The point we are making by taking a foreign view is that gold prices are marking the world reserve currency's domestic pricing market, not it's currency's exchange market. Just as in our recent Euro and EuroLand posts, we measure a currencies true values within it's local markets. From these positions it's clear that US goods have not come close to pricing all the dollar expansion of the last 20+ years. A dynamic that would have been exposed long ago if our reserve currency function were threatened as it is now.

Had a large cross segment of foreign nationals owned dollars over the last number of years, they would have watched their purchasing power in the US market gain some 30% or more when comparing to their various local moneys. Yet, US prices did not even drop a little on a productivity basis balancing act that could have evened out the loss on exchange against these foreign moneys. No, the whole world is not so evil or completely wrong in it's currencies and goods pricing values. Nor are we so god given productive. Clearly, the dollar is being driven up in an end time liquidity game that is more like a race between suitors. But this race is exposing our age.

As an example of value justification, had these nationals owned gold in one of these countries at say $400US; the loss of gold purchasing power on the US market would more directly compare to their average (many nations) currency's exchange loses. Take that 30% from $400 gold and you find the range of $280 gold. About where we are now. This recent price is demonstrating the world over that using gold as a real economic value scale, US goods have already been inflated in America today. Yes, our inflation is running 30%+ over these last years, compared to the world's price structure.

(Those of you falling behind, climb hard and take larger steps. We need to get to the top before sunset, so the battle can be seen!)

This is the process that we are now deep into. Our economy cannot adjust to this form of competition using it's normal, from the past currency policy. To sustain our current economic momentum we must resort to a serious outright currency inflation. Only, this time the game will be different than from before! Today, the world's only true modern reserve currency is going to price all fiats on a level playing field. That currency, by the way, "is oil"!

In the time directly before us, this level and in the open competition is going to gut our economy by exploding the US trade deficit before it explodes anyone else's. Eventually, our inability to shut down that deficit will demand a super run in our local US price structure. This dynamic will also be exposed in the "DOLLAR" price of real "physical gold".

Because they and other Giants were buying all the gold our american made paper markets would supply without driving the price above a domestic US price structure comparison. Remember, the question was never "Where" is the gold going, rather always why are we selling it?

This past inflation of paper gold would not only produce circumstances that only strengthen the exchange rate value of our dollars, but somewhat lower the price of gold in relation to our local goods prices instead of against oil. This position generated buying at the constantly lower levels this new ratio generated. Even though gold would later be priced in dollars using oil at 1gm per barrel. Lower gold was good for them (us) but demanded a currency policy above our economic structure's ability to sustain. Even as our true price inflation remained hidden in the dollar's reserve currency status, it was only a matter of time before the system fell apart. If cheap oil could only keep US prices even (not falling) then expensive oil would one day demand at least a strong economy busting exchange rate. It will be to that end (our economy will fail with our reserve currency status) and physical gold will rise from serious bidding to match any future economic supportive price inflation we embark upon. You and I know what the system will provide.

Expose a market dynamic that is delivering in your favor by taking more than can be supplied? You don't! You allow the broken system to expose itself first, then you move on. You see, unlike the boys across the valley, many of us (grin) are buying gold "the currency" not gold "the commodity". There is a world of strategic difference in how and why this is done today compared to yesterday.

The Washington Agreement was a signal as to what side of gold the ECB was on. Now, with all the players at the chess board, the clock has just been punched! All the words I and Another have written is now on the line!

My friend, it's show time!

Paris, Friday, October 6, 2000

--FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank surprised markets Thursday by raising interest rates--------

---'We see no threat to growth'' from this rate increase, Mr. Duisenberg said. He said the euro-zone economy was at ''cruising altitude.''-----------

-----The move stunned economists----------

------''They keep raising rates into a slowing economy, '-----''It is hard to see why they would have done it today other than to try to prop up the euro.''-------------

------The ECB seems intent on crushing any inflation that stems from high crude oil prices and the weak euro. It cannot afford to appear soft on inflation, analysts said, when its own credibility is on trial and the euro under pressure.------

------Still, Mr. Duisenberg said, ''We had the maximum possible degree of consensus on today's decision.'' ------------

I'll skip the hike this weekend and show up here to discuss and clarify.

Checking the view!

Hello everyone,

Before starting my discussion on the main forum today, let me begin the long process of clarifying our ( mine and the Giants I walk behind) views and understandings of the many concepts that drive our position. Indeed, these concepts and positions create and drive "the modern gold markets" of today.

By now many of you can see, that as events have proven, our gold market has indeed evolved. It's become a different sort of animal than the one we knew a few short years ago. Certainly it's response to world events is not even close to it's reply even as far back as fifteen years ago. Whether you follow gold stocks, play the gold paper derivatives or buy bullion itself, your portfolio has been impacted by these important changes in how gold is valued and priced.

Addressing everyone now with this is important, because most every investor in the "gold market" dynamic reads these words and has a perceived failing stake in the game. I also believe the entire system as we know it has reached the end of it's timeline that Another's Thoughts were always pointing to. So, today I'll make the first of many, clear and to the point posts. All done with a purpose of getting everyone into shape for the long hike directly before us.

-------------------------------

Dollar currency and paper Gold? ----- both have been inflated ----- both will fail!---

Take a brief moment to look at the dollar as a fiat currency only and forget anything about it's past or present connection to gold. Consider the dollar as being backed by the actual goods it's economy (the USA) produces and how that backing is governed by a stable price for those goods.

In other words let's assume we will allow the USA to print all the currency it wants as long as that amount matches the ability of our economic structure to deliver goods against those dollars. Further, let's say the gauge of whether this is working correctly is read in the price of those goods (in dollars) being stable.

As long as our (USA) society could make goods and deliver then for dollars in a stable price range, it should be fair to say that any and all of us would always own, retain, save and use dollars as a reasonable paper currency. If over any ten or twenty year period, the fiat prices for delivered goods stayed the same, in the minds of everyone (myself included) digital paper dollars would indeed be as good as owning things themselves.

Do you see the thought thrust of the above? By a wide margin, humans want to equate holding dollars as the same as holding goods. Like this fictional account:
### I went to a Ford dealer the other day to see about getting a new SUV explorer. The dealer I went to had a ten year supply of them on hand (he must have been a big dealer - smile) and said they went for $22,000 each. He said that he had so many of them that their price would not vary much at all and they could even fall. Further, he said that I could take my time,,,,,, no rush,,,, come in any time and he was sure the supply would be there. Well,,,,,, I had the $22K in the bank and my old SUV was still working fairly well,,,,,,, so I didn't buy. I just went home, safe in the assumption that my $22K in the bank was as good as a new Ford SUV. In fact,,,, as the weeks went buy I even told my friends I had a "paper SUV" in the bank! All I had to do was "call for delivery"! ###
You see where this is going now, don't you? Over time, America has printed and created various forms of dollars and dollar substitutes while distributing then at home and the world over. The driving force behind this dynamic is in ours and the world's perception that these dollars are paper versions of "real things". This is the bedrock of a fiat currency; that the economic structure of the nation that prints said money can deliver goods against that currency and do it at a stable price.

Our dollar currency system has drifted far, far away from this expectation. Early on, years ago as we began printing more money than the goods we produced could be delivered (sell) against, prices began to rise (price inflation). But we adapted by expecting interest returns on these dollar holdings to make up the price rises. We accepted that if in general, American price inflation was running at say 5% then an 8% return would somewhat cover it. Over time and throughout our up and down price inflation cycles, we progressed further and further into accepting some form of ever increasing extra return on dollar savings as the balancing factor. Today, whether it's the stock market, bonds or whatever, dollar holders rely more and more on trading profits and derivatives to cover the added risk.

So what is wrong with this? Well,,,, our private dollar accounts have been covered because their numbers are increasing. At least if you have done your homework and were a good trader! Truly, there are ever increasing dollars in the world and their increase is helping to reassure dollar holders that their money is still equal to "real things". But, in reality it's the ability of the finite US system to deliver real goods against these ever increasing paper demands for delivery that is in question.

Over time, we have come to think of all of our various dollar substitutes as being easily converted into real things by just calling for delivery. In other words, spending them on something.

Again:

This "spending" is the process directly before us that will default the dollar through inflation. This is how a contract system, like our dollar currency begins to fail. Everyone, through trading or just plain old interest on CDs has built up an ever larger holding of "paper delivery notices" in the form of dollar credits. Like my example above, these "paper SUVs" have been inflated even as the ability to supply real goods produced in the US, has stayed the same. In fact, "THE PHYSICAL GOODS" that must be legally delivered against these "dollar legal tender credits" cannot come anywhere close to covering the (fiat) contracts written!

In the days ahead, we will see it as price inflation as Physical goods cannot be delivered against all the outstanding currency calls in the consumer marketplace. In many cases, it's the holders of these "paper SUV" contracts (what we call dollars) that will see their savings value tumble as the underlying physical goods soars in price.

So, this is the classical price inflation that results after a long expansion of a fiat currency. From the beginning the currency is seen as a contract for the delivery of goods sometime in the future. We save it (fiat) instead of spending it because it's convent and logical. Yet, the more that people, and in general the international marketplace relies on this method of holding their goods the more the officials expand the contracts (fiat currency) as a method of creating fictional wealth. This expanded currency is used to buy services, goods and commodities, even oil! But it's timeline has a beginning and an end. Today, we are at the dollar's end!

More:

So do we see any comparison to "paper gold" in the above? You bet we do! Like hand in glove "gold the money" travels the exact same route "dollars the fiat" does in our modern banking system.

For every person that thinks their "paper dollar" holdings can be spent for goods and receive those goods (call for delivery) at near today's price,,,,,,,,,, there are almost as many "paper gold holders" that think the world system will "deliver gold" in the price and amounts they have contracted for. Folks,,,,,, in today's world that's a lot of gold owners!

Yet, the holders of "paper gold" will fair little better than the holders of "paper dollars" in the coming super inflation. Both will lag the price rises of physical goods and physical gold as the inability of the finite supply system to deliver comes into play. One will end up in grocery markets trying to spend those paper dollar contracts and beat rising prices, while the other ends up in court, waiting for the delivery of physical gold that simply does not exist.

--------------------------------------

Another (and by following him, myself also) has seen this end from long ago. We buy physical gold not for it's commodity dollar value, but rather for it's money value in the coming failure of the entire dollar system. We do not expect the world to fail, rather change. We see a transition where traders see the loss of a infrastructure that blocks their building of wealth. Bullish gold traders detest our view because it denies them their dollar trading profits. Yet, dollar profits were exactly what we were trying to avoid.

To date, Another's view and position has been and is continuing to be right. The dollar paper system is on fire and the gold paper system is failing from continuous supply. The dollar is being forced upward as oil values rise, blocking all efforts of the Fed to raise rates and contract the runaway system. Hyperinflation is directly in our path.

I'll talk more about this and other things on the main forum, today.

Comment

Hell everyone,

I wasn't going to add anything to the trail today, but we decided it was time to begin placing things in clear terms. It looks like our political posturing is leaving the "let's talk about this behind the door stage" and entering the "show us your cards stage". This is not just predicated on the recent ECB rate hike alone. Some other things are in the works and with this new climate, it won't be long before we see it on the news.

Certainly, we must talk about SteveH's recent posts. He has made a real effort in trying to unravel the gold value question. In addition ORO has some good reasoning that must be addressed. So before I begin:

Hello Hermit Club, and welcome!

I fully well know just how hard it is to see the prospects of US dollar price inflation right now. Unless one has been following this trail for a long time the present economic momentum seems like an object in motion that must stay in motion. But as I tried to present in the Showtime post, the US domestic price structure is already primed to show it's price inflation dynamic. For the first time we have placed ourselves in an unretractable situation. The dollar is terribly strong from this currency competition that it was forced into. If the Federal reserve tries to raise rates to slow our runaway expansion the dollar will only get more overvalued. That process alone will drive our deficit to the
moon. They will not are not going to allow this much longer. Yet, the fed has little choice but to stand pat or even lower rates in the face of any perceived slowdown. With the current debt and derivative stress built into the dollar system, their only card is currency exchange intervention to
lower the dollar. But we will always hear this as supporting some other currency.

As Giovanni Dioro said in #38437, " but judge them not by their words, but by their actions".

Hello GD, we do judge them by their actions. Just because the Western press, official press releases and various traders say the recent intervention is for the Euro doesn't mean it's true! On one side of the equator the drain water swirls one way while on the other side it goes the other, no? So if the Euro is up the dollar is down? Or is it if the Euro is down the dollar is up? Which perception is right?

We watch the actual local buying power relative to the local currencies to judge which way the water flows. Not only is Euro purchasing power relatively stable, it's basic across the board interest rates are lower than the US. The ECB could just as easily raise their rates to par with the US and the Euro would spike well above the dollar without any intervention at all. But making the Euro "as strong as the dollar right now is not their plan. The dynamic is to lower our over stressed dollar back to a "strong Euro level"! Now that's a different picture when one sees the Euro where it is with it's low financing rates. Rates that are building a solid foundation under their markets. In time here is where we will see who has the power!

But Euro weakness is not and never was the problem. The ball is squarely in the US court for them to lower the dollar to save their economy busting trade deficit from blowing them sky high. That will require the US to buy Euros or lower their rates and both those actions will greatly expose the
current built in weakness within the US structure. Yes, indeed, everyone is following the Euro weakness ball, but we are watching the entire dollar game. And that tells us that the recent action is part of a larger gameplan to unseat the dollar.

So, take the strong dollar position if you will, but doing so will place your bet in the right direction, but on the wrong horse. Just like trying to leverage a gold market position using a paper dynamic; good bet, wrong horse.

Black Blade,

As a point of trivia: did you know that back in the early to mid 70s a Mcf of top tier (that's heavy) natural gas sold as high as $9.50!! That's when an old friend of mine that owned the Woodlands (in Houston) started cracking it into liquids. FWIW

Trail Guide - ECB rate hike
I take it that the WAR is going out into the open. Is that so?

Hello ORO and thank you for your time here. Your ongoing breakdown of economics is to say the least, expansive! (smile)

Yes, the war is heating up now. There is simply no time left for negotiations. Officials are definitely beginning to play their cards before the betting even comes around. Don't be surprised if the US strongly stomps on the dollar at the same time they lower rates. This will smash the carry markets and probably crunch the dow. Whether they can wait until after the election is now very iffy??

All the posturing in the ME for accepting Euros for oil is having an effect and the higher the oil price goes the greater this effect is becoming. I said in the spring that $45 a barrel was coming and now $30 looks like the bottom. If we allow such a settlement proposition to go by without some action against the dollar to head it off, the eventual drop in dollar strength could be incredible. Let's face it,
the only difference between the dollar and Euros right now is world settlement support for all goods. With our trade deficit where it is, selling dollars for even third tier currencies would crash it.

-----------
your post:

Some mention has been made that Eddie is dumping Euro and that the hedgies got a green light to resume shorting the Euro from the Anglo camp. Does this mean the UK has finally decided to go with the dollar camp after Labour stating for years that the EMU membership is "inevitable"? Was this presumed turn of events the cause for the escalation?

No possible way, ORO! That's another example of trader posturing. These guys have been shorting the Euro and Yen from the get go and don't know what's waiting for them. You said it all later in your post "Euro carry has had the door slammed in its face"! Their positions makes good talk, but in reality they are just providing hedge material (making a deep market) for legitimate trade financing in Euros. The shorts are in it for a trade while the big finance is done for many years. If you finance in Euros your risk is in a rising currency, so these shorts create the derivative for you to throw off to them, your risk. Once the perception changes, these billions in shorts will not have a market to cover in. The big international positions will just keep the shorts capitol and then some!

UK is sliding right into EMU whether they like it or not. How can they not? The dollar has hit it's final timeline top and the US fed will see to it it's downhill from here on out. The only escape for the UK is to jump into the relatively closed trading markets in the Euro zone. The EMU group trades with themselves a lot more than with anyone else so being within them during a free for all in the
dollar will prove irresistible. I sold my pounds a long time ago and know they will belong to me once again in the form of Euros. (smile)

-------------------

Further to comment to your post:

I think we have only begun to hear this talk about Euro oil settlement. Some of it is shifting right now and not saying anything about it. The Russians are selling so little of anything they are a non event right now. But wait, they will follow the leader, especially as we see more of an active stance from the US bringing down the dollar.

Now, for Steve (smile).

thanks

SteveH, what can I say, you have written so much recently I have a hard time covering it all. Because my system comes on in auto mode and copies the forum at random times,,,,, or someone does it for me,,,,, I don't always catch all the imput. So, I'll try to comment on some of your thrust.

Just looking at 714's post #38448 today one can see that oil prices in gold go way back. It's no secret that in a broad term of valuations 1 gram brought a barrel of oil. We mentioned something to that effect long ago. Truth be told that is where Bunker Hunt got the angle when silver was in the $20 range in the late 70s. Then silver was hitting the old dollar gold targets that gave 1 gram gold for a barrel. He went on and on how one ounce of silver was equal to a barrel of oil.

Well, so much for then. Some producers are striving for a pricing gauge that can peg the value of oil in a modern society. A gauge that is not corrupted by currency inflation (I'm talking about the expansion of currencies not the general price levels such an expansion produces).

If someone is going to print some derivative,,,,, hand it to you in exchange for a finite commodity,,,,,, that's fine as long as you immediately lend it back to them or spend it for something. The problem today is that lending derivatives only brings in more derivatives and that process is made irreversible if the nation you deal with runs a permanent trade deficit. That's because the remedy to said trade deficit, when it is eventually deployed destroys the actual derivative (paper money) you are lending. It doesn't take a nuclear scientist to understand how this will end and how
it will affect your long term wealth. On the other hand, spending the money on something has it's limits when you are trying to build a self-sustaining economy. One that allows your citizens to market their abilities to the world. Neither can you trade your paper dollar wealth for gold wealth if the rest of the world gets wind of it?

In the end you are left to selling some portion of your oil for gold. No it doesn't happen the way our trader boys delight in degrading it; "some truck loaded with gold backs up and dumps bullion bars on the ground as the main man tells his worker bee to turn the valve"! No the oil is turned into bookkeeping currency digits in some bank's computer. Then those digits are traded for the ownership or rights to gold. When someone posted what Another said the figures were, I think that that 20 million of actual bullion in retention represented the tally over some ten years (and was growing).

You see, gold like any currency is also spent. Even Cavan Man (smile) can add up all his pay receipts over ten years and that doesn't equal his savings. That would be nice CMan but it doesn't work that way, does it? The main reason they don't take gold outright, 1 gm per barrel is that "noone" wants to bust the digital system completely. As much as everyone thinks our paper money is all bad, it really works fairly well. I think oil producers are like everyone else and only want a more fair control on the print press. As it is right now, the dollar is done and we are just witnessing
the management of it's transition away from reserve status.

To that end, oil has played the gold paper game with the best of them. No, they don't expect all their paper to return physical gold. But they do expect the gold they now have and a portion that will be sent to them (settling paper) to take over any lost wealth that occurs as the dollar grinds down. Needless to say, gold will have to jump a great deal to do this. It will. In doing this gold's
dollar value will represent all the incoming domestic US price inflation on the horizon plus all the currency inflation left over after the dollar hype's out. Again, that will be a lot. Much, much higher than anyone with Western eyes can now see.

But selling (inflating) paper gold to keep the price down (so oil can flow) had it's draw backs for the dollar system. Yes, it creates a two tier paper market that will send gold to the most favored first (in case of failure). But the left over contracts (held by hedgers both large and small) will have a huge disproportionate impact on the financial structure. Not only will no gold be delivered because
enough doesn't exist, but the price rise of physical against such paper will drain the books of many major financial houses. And at the price levels we are talking about, official intervention will be an absolute. At least until the wipe out is done, then gold will come to the forefront. Further, in today's world of molecular speed trading, all of this initial crisis will happen in a heartbeat. Blink,,,, it's done!

--------------

Steve, like I offered in an earlier post today, what perception of value is true? With all the dollars and their derivatives that are around today (80 trillion??) how can we know where the worth of oil is to our modern society? The continuos printing of dollar derivatives and gold derivatives makes the whole question a joke. Even supply and demand cannot answer the question when our supply and demand use dollars to create both sides of the equation. This is where physical gold comes in. It's the only denominator that is money in and of itself and no one can inflate it. We say, OK, one gram per barrel is where we are going. What currency price per barrel will that be? Who can tell? Will that much gold flow in to cover all the barrels produced? Of course not, all of us have bills. But some small portion will be retained and it's that portion that has become the ticking time bomb for the paper gold world!

This is the reason Another said they would eventually burn the paper markets. His implication was if the Euro failed at birth and later if the Euro succeeded. Once the Europeans began their withdrawal in 1999, it would be left to the US to act in it's own best interest. Just as they did in 71,
they will print paper gold currency until it's trading market values it at zero. Going back in time, I remember when the pre 71 dollar was being sold (inter CB trade) for 1/10 it's gold backing because everyone began to expect that no gold would be delivered to settle international trade
balances. I suspect that our present gold markets will do the same thing.

The Europeans have tried to structure their new currency to be prominently displayed as all this unfolds. Any breakdown in the dollar paper gold system will drive people away from dollars and into Euros and physical gold. Because the ECB / BIS is committed to a FreeGold market, the sky will be the limit in dollar terms. I fully expect the ECB to begin it's assault now because as Mr. D has said, our Euro is now mature and can walk into battle. We shall see!

thanks SteveH

Now THAT doesn't sound good. Please, Trail Guide, for the common man, would you care to expand on "the US fed will see to it it's downhill from here on out"?

JavaMan, Hello!
Well, the US economy is going full blast now even as the dollar is at it's peak. In the past, at this stage the dollar would have already rolled over from the effects of fed / treasury / government intervention to slow the boom. In fact, contrary to everything we read and hear, they have been trying to slow this thing down for some time. We only hear it as; "it's the new computer, highly productive, new wave, next economy that's driving all the money into the US and their markets"! But, in reality something was out there driving the dollar higher even as the brakes were being
applied.

Now the government is in a box it's never been in before. It they raise rates or slow reserve creation this will just drive the dollar ever higher while at the top of a boom phase. The explosion in deficit trade balances would at some point cause a crack up from where there is no escape
(deflation?). They can only play the intervention card to lower the dollar and that (because we are the dollar creating entity) will cause an inflationary run. Further, in conjunction with intervention, they could also lower rates. This will have the same effect in this overheated marketplace. Either way, the dollar is going to drop to the level of the Euro.

Note: again, I ask how are we going to know that? It will spin as "the Euro finally rose to dollar par"!

Then and only then will we all have a look at our respective US and European financial structures on a relative even basis. I expect to see the Euro Zone taking off with some price inflation and a declining trade surplus heading toward deficit. All the while the US goes hyper with mountains of
dollars coming home. And I don't mean coming home for investment. I mean coming home to exercise delivery against real US produced goods. I expect that before this is over, we (US) might be forced to use our gold card to help devalue the dollar. That would involve a forced restructuring of. the gold markets so as to make gold rise. A few political heads would roll if this takes place. Believe it!

So, will this all begin before the elections? The fuel certainly is in place. We shall see.

It seems since Sept. 22,2000 the up and down movements of the paper Gold markets close-ly follow the up and down movements of the Euro value on the FOREX markets. Is this movement a coincidence or is there some sort of correlation going on between the (perceived) price of Gold and the value of the Euro?

Hello beasting,

I know that somewhere,,,,,, out there,,,,,,, some smart brains are starting to put a relative value on the Euro using it's relationship to gold. It's only just starting, but it's almost like using Euros in place of what Gold stocks used to be. Indeed, if the Euro becomes established as the premier settlement currency and fully allows gold to price out to whatever level,,,,,, then in dollar terms Euros will return an awful lot. Just look at it like a native holding dollars during one of the Asian meltdowns?

As time goes by gold and Euros will most likely run together. Again, we shall see.

Last post.

ET,

Your question about oil and it's continued use in this unfolding drama is a whole chapter's worth of replies. Oil will some day be priced very cheaply and this will make an end run around fuel cell technology and what have you. It's not the supply of oil that's been a problem, rather how we pay for it in real money.

Thanks all
Until the next time on the Gold Trail

Our Position -- Their Position ----- From Which Mountain Will You View The Valley Battle

Hello once again!

I see that our little group of "Western Minded Physical Gold Advocates" is growing by leaps and bounds. I have added Western to the phrase as a way of distinguishing them from most of the world's other physical buyers. It seems that outside our American way of understanding wealth, gold has always been a savings currency for other peoples! Only now has the Western mind begun to see gold as real wealth. Anyway, each week's walk on the trail has more hikers than the last. No doubt the ongoing failure of paper gold substitutes must be taking it's toll.

Many new travelers here once held long term beliefs (myself included) about physical gold and it's relationship with various leveraged paper gold substitutes. I understand how easy it is to consider these relationships to be solid, valued historic perceptions. But today, they are not.

Most of the current gold market and it's industry has only recently matured to the present state of paper sophistication. If I had to venture a guess I would say it all began just 28 +/- years ago, in 1971? An even better estimate would tie it to the early to mid 80s. In any event, this is the period (from then till say 1996) that most gold thinkers use to build value relationships into paper gold from physical gold. In other words, if gold is at "such and such" price then typical, traditional trading has historically valued paper prices (mine stocks, gold options, futures, etc.?) at "such and such" price.

What so many failed to understand was that all of those old dollar gold values and their paper relationships were created during the dollar "near failure" of that time (70s?). Not the dollar failure that's coming (00s?). The great dollar inflation, back then in the USA and it's impact on our world was hardly an inflation by historic readings. Truly, what our Western minds saw as a colossal explosion in gold prices was only a "blip" of size and substance relative to the "blip" of inflation that occurred then! Again, the physical - to - paper context of today uses those same conditions and trading results to reach value conclusions and extrapolates these into our future paper gold substitute's prices. A process that I submit will find our paper gold traders running far behind the real price inflation that's coming. Yes, these paper gold plays may indeed go up, but they will not gain the way bullion does relative to the currency destruction that's ahead.

The only lasting impact the historic 70s dollar price inflation had was to set off a search to create a replacement for the world's greenback reserve system. A "political will" was created to hold this reserve system together at any and all cost and for whatever amount of time was needed to build said replacement. If the "will" was not strong enough or "time" not long enough, it was easy to see that gold would be the fall back reserve. Indeed, that would be quite a fall back, especially for those people (governments included) without gold.

We make the point for physical gold today because today is different! There is a huge difference between controlling an "ongoing price inflation" and battling an ongoing timeline failure of your currency. The first is controlled through printing restraint, while the second is managed to a bitter end. Some would sarcastically say "it's manipulated for it's longest lasting effects".

So, we walk this trail to build an understanding of "gold the savings" not "gold the dollar account multiplier"! Thinking as the "Giants" walking before us think;
"we don't want more dollars as a result of gold gaining permanent long term value that will last a lifetime, we want more gold"!
Onward!

Our Position -- Their Position ----- From Which Mountain Will You View The Valley Battle

Once again, I'll expand further while we walk so as to make our case more clear.

Last week I closed by saying; " " We do not expect the world to fail, rather (to) change. We see a transition where traders see the loss of an infrastructure (paper gold market place) that blocks their building of wealth." "!

It's a clear choice for anyone walking this trail; use paper gold derivatives to gain more dollars or hold physical gold to gain more wealth?

This is the presentation we offer. This is the wisdom you must decide upon.

Will our dollar show a strong price inflation as it did in the 70s? If it does and does so in a slowly building fashion, then the current paper gold market and pricing system should work. Allowing it's participants a chance to "cash out" into more dollars. Dollars, I might add that should gain somewhat in goods pricing value as the system cycles through one more price inflation phase.To date, this outdated trading strategy is not working, is it?

Truly, this is the race most paper gold players are betting on. They point to the fact that gold bugs have been calling for dollar destruction and hyperinflation for a long, long time. Yet, it never happened! I agree. Indeed, we (modern Physical Gold Advocates) never saw the dollar as ending it's reserve roll then, either. Nor did we figure that the USA or it's dollar empire would fall. We brought and held (long term) some gold, but mostly sold in and out of the cycles as best as possible.

But as time traveled on, dollar debt exploded in a fashion none of us could understand. Over this same period, my relationship with several world thinkers helped me to grasp the changing dynamics of our money system. Placing all of the "Oil for Gold" and "Political Games" in a lesser dimension, I learned where we were headed over the long term. Indeed, ongoing national financial strategies are only something to observe along the trail.

A transition away from our dollar reserve world went a long way to defining the process we witnessed over this last decade. There is simply no possible way the dollar debt load could have been expanded to it's present scale without a massive worldwide helping hand. Yet conversely, to help explode dollar assets was clearly and end time maneuver that would destroy everyone's assets. Unless some other system was on the wind, ready to take over.

This is really where our modern gold trail begins, the early 90s. Mostly because this is when the logic began to leak out from behind closed doors. We can see the influence of "Old World" hard money in this new fiat reserve creation, where gold can be the fall back if the system fails. We can now openly see the slow destruction of our dollar's mainstay in creating it's value illusion; "the dollar based, world paper gold system".

Clearly, this system had full international support for many years as our paper gold pricing helped to maintain dollar demand and use through it's illusion of dollar value. That mirage was always a steady to falling gold price that not only helped price oil, but strengthened dollar savings demand. Starting in the mid 90s, we began to see the very first cracks in this support as it became clear to us that paper gold market support would fall away as the Euro was born and grew. Once established and with the Euro "walking on it's own legs" support for the dollar, in lower gold prices would fall ever more heavily upon our US financial structure. A structure that ironically is heavily built on the British LBMA. Perhaps explaining the struggle to keep England out of EMU for as long as possible.

Knowing full well that they could not sell US treasury gold into a BIS sanctioned currency reserve transition for fear that foreign CBs would simply consume all the gold, they opened the paper gold flood gates in a fashion similar to printing dollars prior to 1971. Today, our old disgraced system of non redeemable 70s dollars backed by insufficient vault gold has been replaced with "commodity market contract gold". Any increase in stress would require Paper gold to flood the markets in ever increasing amounts so as to stifle any rise in the system. A dollar gold paper system that sets the price of physical gold trading. Indeed, as our good poster on the USAGOLD FORUM (SteveH) (hello Steve, smile) notes it, they are using commodity gold markets to influence world monetary gold values and reserves.

Is all of this a surprise? No, at least not to Modern Physical Gold Advocates that have been watching "Events" these last few years, as Another asked. Clearly, this is the guide map for an ending currency system. You explode the currency substitutes (debt?) worldwide, to save your banking system for as long as traders will accept it. When international "political will" begins to walk away from your fiat, you take up the ball of last resort and run with it; "you inflate the gold issuance for all you are worth"! Indeed, you sell it into destruction!

Let's rest a minute and look around!

Now do you see why major players are buying physical gold as carefully as possible out of sight? Now do you see why they are also buying paper gold, in sight so as to make a market and slow it's destruction decent. The longer the system can work, right up to the end, the more small amounts of gold can be brought. Eventually, even a tiny amount of gold will more than balance all the loses in dollar gold contracts.

Further, do you see why even gold mines will suffer such a loss of share value as the paper price descends. Yet, once to it's (gold's) final destruction level (and the share prices follow it), the rise in physical will come in a full scale crisis that demands crisis nationalization of all paper trading. Not Physical trading, just paper contract trading! Paper market shut down for adjustments?

Because the new fiat competitor for our dollar system has based it's strength on a functioning free gold marketplace, every nation will be forced to do the same using bullion. To compete they will have no choice but to free gold for their citizens, even as they lock down in ground reserves with grandfather "windfall profits taxes"! All enacted while share trading and paper bullion trading is halted for months on end.

As I stand here, my view is:

I do not hate gold shares (I own some) or gold derivatives (I own three of those also as an experiment on the main forum).

My only offense to paper gold traders is that;

"I place these gold substitutes in their proper perspective in our changing world". "Another" has challenged you to do the same.

Hello SteveH,

I had time away from gardening this morning, so reading your directives and TownCrier's recent good thoughts gave me something to say.

I read your recent long post that organized (in your own mind) all the goings on in the currency / gold world. It is some mess, isn't it? A lot of the better understanding of all this has been hidden for years as it was covered up with "goldbug" oratorio from the broker / trader camp.

You see, our world of physical gold thinking has been influenced by these Western trader thoughts and convictions for many years. Physical gold advocates didn't know how much the "gold - is - wealth" story was being diluted until only recently.

Now as we watch reality sink in, events are distilling the gold story and burning off all their paper trading theories. Suddenly (for them it's suddenly) gold is not "to the world" what traders wanted it to be or played it for. Leveraged paper gold substitutes and their lot, such as mining shares are no longer as good as physical.

This is a hard truth for most Western hard money thinkers to accept. They predicated their investment position for years (and some still do) on the past record that is; "as long as paper gold multiplied my dollar account in more or equal fashion as bullion, then paper is as good as gold".

But the truth always was that a dollar account will never keep up with physical gold during a currency war where the fiat is defeated. This is the final outcome that hard money advocates have waited for and positioned themselves against for many years. Yet, when the game is at hand, they find themselves having taken a hard money position that advocates more paper trading (instead of riding physical). They
brought the leverage story and it's suddenly become a leverage against them. All the while we knew that the most fantastic leverage available was really in holding physical.
After reviewing some of the posts on other forums it's clear they are drifting now. Traders (such as "uptick"?) entered this paper arena and operated in it most of their hard money lifetime. They analyzed it like it was a stock or commodity. They did this over the recent life of our semi free gold
market since it was born. Sometimes with success and sometimes not, but now that gold is entering it's real explosive stage their game plan cannot read it. Paper trades don't work when this thought comes out into the open; "gold - is - an - international - money - and - manipulated - in - fiat - warfare - just - like - currencies"------.

The gulf between those that have "physical and can stay and master the play" and " those that will be driven out with paper loses to great to bear" is widening now. The once confident trading opinions we all read are being burned out of our gold world and truth is replacing them. In some
ways it's good to have these outdated thoughts still posted because even "new to the game" thinkers can see this is not the way to go. Even though sharfin is not a newcomer, he is smarter than than most. Here is part of his post:

The comments weren't mine but from the other side. As to your last comment re paper gold.
I think exactly opposite.

There's no way I would touch paper gold till after this coming correction. All the signs are there that paper gold is slowly being destroyed. To commit assets to paper gold in front of a meltdown is a lunacy.

After the washout perchance it will be different. But to do so before is pure gambling.
-----------------------------------

Steve,
Our modern gold market is set to bankrupt itself. All the political options have been put in play now and it's showtime. We must grab all the physical possible without disrupting the price setting mechanism. Lean back and watch as the US (our) dollar / gold structure cooks away in it's own stew. "NOONE" is going to grab any gold at the bottom of the turn because it will not be for sale then for an extended workout time. Once the real dollar price emerges (many thousands) only physical will trade. Only at this time, at and after the turn will paper gold be fully discredited in a total default. Don't look for many posts saying this thinking was right, those traders will be too
despondent to even think much less write. I don't feel to badly about saying this as most of these guys were never hard money advocates in the first place. Many of them never stood back and looked at what their actions really entailed. That being; they mostly wanted to use the physical gold
advocate's actions to make some leveraged money for themselves then move on. Owning real wealth was never their philosophy.

So, every investment era has it's beginning and end. We (I assume you are a bullion holder like myself) can stand back and watch this paper gold system dissolve while gold the real international currency moves on. Our wealth in gold , whether large or small will weather this storm and produce
some spectacular gains for our living standard. All because we made the hard choice to stand aside the misguided torrent that was an unavoidable river of Western thought.

To use an illustration from an old Robert Redford movie I state my own verse;

"the land is pure from peak to peak
it is we that must choose our gate
from where to view this nation's thoughts that flow
this river that runs through it will decide our fate"

thanks

Hello Knallgold,

I will never finish my fresh herb garden if I continue to read these posts. Good health and a strong spirit from fine wine with food is much better than gold, you know (smile).

Yes, I also own some gold shares. It's quite an amount, even at these prices. But it is in a reasonable proportion to my other assets. Should have never said anything about it because I knew very few people would understand the rational at that time.

Brought the companies for their philosophy, not their current (at that time) share values. This was done with an eye on the future, on the other side of this battle. From the beginning, it was fully well understood that the paper price of gold would fall until some convulsion crushed it's credibility. Where on the dollar gold price range this would occur depended on the players at the chess board. But, the ongoing dollar price was never to be the gauge of success, anyway.

With this in mind, the very best shares were chosen (there are only a few good ones around the world). Both bullion (large amounts, still accumulating) and shares (small amount and one time buy) were brought with an expectation of a zero price in dollars. In other words; we brought shares for
their possible survival and we brought bullion to own ounces outright, not dollars per ounce. This is a far different and stronger mental position than you read from leveraged traders, no? If gold soars tomorrow, good! If it plunges tomorrow, good! I am on this trail for the destination, not the game. Even though, the sights along the way will be incredible to behold.

For better of worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and good health,,,,,, this is the path I follow. After reading that line, you are correct to assume I am married to this position (smile). I can tell you it is a very large ongoing wedding, because none of us ever walk this trail alone.

Further:

I have to say that had the mining industry promoted it's product as a wealth holding and pushed for investors to buy gold first, ahead of and in greater quantity than their common shares; there is a good chance the markets would have changed long before now. No different than watching Ford
push their vehicles and ending up with people owning and always buying more of their product. Never hear of anyone saying their ford shares can carry just as much as a new ranger (smile).

But, by promoting paper leverage (of all kinds) as being the same or better in value than what history taught us about gold, trader advocates played themselves and their investors right into the slaughter of open currency warfare.

It would be great if these markets would break, right now. Giving some type of paper run that allowed many regular people time to reallocate. It may, but political will is against it. As it is, many such as yourself (?) are striving mentally to adjust their diminished capitol so as not to risk it all.

By the way,,,,,, the very old investor I mentioned some time ago,,,,, the one that was slowly allocation a decades long ride in the dow into bullion. He is now completely out and in cash and bullion. He trusts gold and knows nothing about oil or the Euro. Yet, still strong in his feelings that a
big inflation may lift the dow further. I don't dare debate him because his record is flawless for some many many years,,,, and his wealth is truly great.

good luck
(now back to my hobby)

Let's settle by the outdoor hearth for heat and conversation. I even see Michael Kosares back there with a warm cup. The fire is aglow,,,,,, the talk is about the trail before us:

Aristotle, said this today:
--------------------------
Aristotle (10/19/2000; 5:44:45MT - usagold.com msg#: 39386)
Do you heed your own advice? Thoughts on Trade deficits--big and small

"""""As for the U.S., we are in a unique but temporary position in which we haven't yet had to pay the full price for our past trade deficits. Until that day arrives (with severe currency devaluation), we might be inclined to stand the old terms on their heads and describe our current trade deficit as a FAVORABLE trade position because we are receiving real goods and services from other countries with partial payment (required in excess of our own exports) made in typically depreciating paper of our own easy creation.""""""
-----------

Aristotle,

In this post you also made another very good point (see full post) by directing Hard Money Advocates to pursue their own often stated doctrine. I think that perception is a given; that when the crisis hits, everyone the world over will be buying gold for depreciating dollars! Indeed, if your Chimps, Champs and Chumps (see his #39302 on the main forum for definitions) are really forward thinking, they would be wise to follow their own strategy by buying physical gold now. Before the winds blow?

Further to ALL:
Following on Aristotle's above:

The dollar deficit is truly the main money destruction tool being forced to function in our modern "killing fields" of today! In the past we saw this trade deficit function operate for only short periods as it constricted growth in our US economy! Now, they have not only the US economy but also it's currency caught permanently in this long term trap. For the first time since we left the gold standard while making them play by our rules, they now have us. Once before, in 1985 (look at a dollar chart then) we were well on our way to the same problems, but the difference then was that "noone" had a potential alternative reserve currency system to run to when we induced a recession. Today they do and this "waiting in the wings system" is the hatchet tool in the hands of our world markets that will do us in. As the ECB says;
""" it's not the Euro is too low, your dollar is too high ,,,,,,,, so go ahead, make my day and fix it"""! (smile)
Indeed, no intervention by the US now is a stab in the heart of the dollar economy.

The US has had the rest of the world in somewhat of a trap also. For a long, long time. Perhaps from when we told them that the world gold exchange standard bearer would no longer ship gold for dollars. From that point on we (USA, my country) could inflate our money without consequences.

In fact, we had to inflate in this "Darwin" fashion over all these years! Truly, if we did not inflate long term and ship liquidity (created dollars) outside the US, our dollar's value would always soar above other strong currencies. This is because of it's world settlement function. Notice I said soar over their value instead of they would fall away from our value. There is a difference. As in our recent hikes, we saw that the internal basket of goods prices for both dollars and Euros dictated that these currencies are at opposite extremes in value and should reverse. Further; I use Darwin because everyone came to think that our sending money overseas was part of the "natural order of things" (chimps (smile)). They thought and still do think that the world just craves our money! They will have a different opinion later.

We must reconcile with the truth of this process by looking at the dollar world from 1971; the one time the dollar soared too high for too long it began killing off our economy. Forcing us into the same printing policy other lesser nations must employ to keep their exchange rate level. Yes, even the USA must sell overseas to create jobs and profits at home. A huge trade deficit in a reserve currency nation, induced by an overvalued currency like we are seeing now, raises the currency's value even further above other strong fiats. This is the way such a reserve system naturally reacts when there is no local reduction in liquidity to check it.

A regular (non reserve currency) nation's money would suffer a different fate if they inflated the native currency the way we do. It's non trade settlement function begets a falling exchange rate. That in turn drives then into the same policy of hyper inflation but it's effects are felt in higher prices, immediately.

Again, conversely, a reserve currency always rises in exchange function from this forced "liquidity draining" trade settlement. Once on this trend, over time, the higher it's value goes the more people finance in other mediums (yen carry, gold carry, Euro carry, oil carry) This further dries up the fractional reserve created dollar reserves as the demand for dollars grows ever stronger from it's ever higher cost trade settlements. Settlements dictated because IMF / dollar protocols demand dollar use as settlement.

In the past if the system began driving the dollar too high and forcing US trade deficits, the Fed would raise rates to throw us (USA) into an economic recession that broke the vicious deficit trade cycle. Knowing full well that it would be a short recession policy because "noone" would jump the dollar ship before the medicine could work. Looking around back then and we see there was no other reserve currency ship to jump to. We either lose jobs and profits from an "overvalued currency" or from an induced recession. The first can lead to a financial breakdown, the lasts corrects things after only a short while. Naturally, we embark on the quick fix of a fast recession.

This is why our times are so very different now. What the "chimps" came to know over this 20+ year period as a strong America in a high dollar, was always something our money creators were striving to fight against. We truly have always been inflating our currency for these many years in a attempt to keep the natural effects of the IMF reserve system from spiking the currency too high up. Again, if we had a regular currency, our policies would have been reflected in sky high prices for everything. What most of us "smart chimps" know as price inflation reflecting money supply inflation.

OK, let me sip some starbuck's:

Ever since the Euro was seen in by US policy makers as an eventual success, our treasury has tried to put it's best "New York Spin" on the ongoing process. Simply stated; from the early to mid 90s we are in favor of a strong dollar policy. In reality, with the advent of the Euro and the evolving stance of the BIS, this has made our "economy killing" strong dollar unavoidable.

There is no way the Fed can create a new recession now without everyone jumping ship for another currency reserve. There is no possible way the Euro Zone will suffer as big a downfall as the US in another policy induced recession. Just looking at their closed economy and debt structure tells that story by itself. Any US slowdown means a run for the Euro, yet weakness in the Euro means the US must inflate at a torrid rate. We now stand toe to toe and wait to see who will fall first. All the while our world dollar gold markets are caught in the cross fire!

This is where we have been for the last decade. This explains why the DOW and all it's paper cousins have enjoyed the effects of a massive, ongoing dollar expansion worldwide without any official policy interference. Right when we were to the point of changing policy to slow things down, the Euro was to be introduced in a year or two and risked taking away or sharing the dollar's standard.

The "lesser chimps", lost in Western thought keep waiting for the fed to induce their deflationary policy. (I was monkey - ing around in this area for a while myself) (grin) It is not coming. To do so now would commit the dollar to non reserve status in a hurry and produce a massive price inflation at home (right now) as all these unneeded dollar reserves come racing home. Remember, the ECB does not need dollar reserves! The Euro is a stand alone currency representing an in house trading block. They may have to buy dollars for oil, but others must also buy Euros for European produced goods. If the Euro went to .10 to the dollar the EuroZone economy would not stop. But all international dollar trade would grind to a halt. The USA could not sell anything internationally, at all! Every other nation would simply abandon the IMF protocols and use their native currencies to trade directly with Europe. Even Arabia would break their SDR basket peg and trade oil for Euro goods, either using their currency or directly if needed.

Our outdoor fireplace is getting hot, lets step away.

The lesser of the two evils today (and this is the one the ECB / BIS enjoys watching) is our current frozen policy. We can no longer cut off the strong dollar / growing deficit circle by raising rates and invoking a recession as in the past. This time we must continue to pump the reserves at all costs in a process that only floods the world with more dollars. It's called a currency hyperinflation and is one we (as US people) have never witnessed in modern times. The pressure has built up full volume now as all escape valves are being closed. We are well on the way to a derivatives exploding event that will break into the open with a cascading dollar and full force US price inflation.

This is the "why" for the gold derivatives policy that Physical Gold Advocates are now enjoying. Also one that leveraged paper gold investors are being tortured with. In effect, we "gold buyers" are trading 1971 style dollar derivatives contracts for the physical gold we never could get then. And doing so before a 1971 style gold event that comes in the form of a denouncement of the contractual viability of all gold contracts. Let's call it "no gold for dollar derivatives"!

All the while, just like in 71 other "chUmps" (smile) are saving these same paper gold substitutes to protect themselves from this same crisis.
Further; many of them have sold their physical gold for use by the BBs. I think SteveH calls it OPG (other peoples gold). This is where the real supply that fills a Physical Gold Advocate nation's coffers (and mine) comes from. It's truly a good deal in light of what's coming. Let's not mess it up by talking about who is buying all that gold, rather just point everyone to watch how much is being sold!

The US cannot walk away from hiking our ""gold trail"" now. Because "this process" is one of the few tools available to them for keeping the dollar perception in a good light. In effect by slowing the currency transition process they are doing exactly what world dollar holders need the to do. They will inflate these derivatives until in effect; our modern gold market bankrupts itself as supply is exhausted. I say, good! (smile) But once we get to that stage, I expect that a super US economic downturn will ensue. Then the fed will go wide open and cover everything in sight to keep us going! The ongoing price inflation will be driving everything from physical gold to real estate through the roof.

I submit that many smart hard money thinkers like Traveler and Thai Gold (and many others) are walking forward but looking backward. I (myself) have tried this before but usually run into something I didn't see in front of me (smile). That something today, for modern hard money followers is in the form of an internationally induced transition away from the US dollar as a reserve currency. Such a policy evolution has the effects of driving the lead currency's creator into printing press mode as an only option to maintaining the viability of our economic and financial structures.

Yes, it eventually breaks everything! But this is nothing new for us gold history buffs and it's what has happen in countless modern national fiats around the world today. Nations that don't have a reserve currency to play with. We will do like their citizens do, continue to use dollars but carry in our pockets whatever new reserve is in fashion, as a backup! Be it gold or Euros or both. In addition, our entire financial structure (like in these other nations) will change to operating in an inflation economy. Money will be lost, big time and made big time, but things will still be financed, brought and sold. Houses will double, triple then double again in price, even as financing rates approach 35%, 40% or whatever. We will also follow the (then) prevailing world policy concerning physical gold, solely because it will make economic sense to our officials.

As such; like today, everyone uses dollar reserves because it keeps us within accepted international policy. Across the currency warfare valley our "gold trail" is coming to, we will also use gold as a free reserve medium. Mostly because it's what the leading reserve policy of that time will dictate and that will keep us on good trading terms.

No, we will not confiscate gold again. Perhaps if it is designated as US legal tender and caught up in some kind of currency change, that will pose a risk! But that's just following the same fiat rollovers so many other countries now must employ and will have little impact on most gold owners. Besides, PGA's know how to avoid such a trap through physical gold ownership diversity! US Eagles held along with a diverse group of new and old coins fit my pocket just fine. I don't worry about the premium on any ounces I buy today. In the future, the total price we now pay will probably be the premium anyway (huge smile from ear to ear!)

Again, as international trends follow the use of physical gold into the free trading asset realm, no longer as an official money, then it's value and ownership will soar the world over. To date this is the future before us as the dollar fails it's function.

Truly, a relationship with an honest international physical gold dealer will no doubt place oneself at the center of this exciting new financial evolution. (I'm trying to think of a dealer that would fit that description? I know I just saw one on this page. Somewhere?) (smile)

Lastly:
Don't tell me an inflating dollar economy doesn't work this way! I have lived in many, many lands and have witnessed and used such inflating systems. Look around for yourself at how non reserve moneys are impacted by their native policy today and the effects of those policies on all real assets. There are few examples that do not follow this regular fiat price inflation mode. Our dollar use and function is about to revert to a lesser more common level, suffering it's drop away from reserve need. In doing so it will change as never before in our time. In fact, it's only the current gold pricing system that may experience a larger change. Not only in use but in Western gold value perception.

I enjoyed the brief detour of the forum on Monday (and some previous days) into the realm of personality types -- with the Gold-related hypothesis that Gold advocates are most likely of the *NT* type. Dabbling with a linked on-line testing page revealed me to be distinctly a type INTP --for whatever that's worth to anyone keeping score.

Which brings me to my point. Any population can be divided and subdivided yet further based on the presence or absence of any given trait. In one rough cut we can focus on those who think independently about monetary affairs, and the remainder will be those who just go along with the flow. I call this latter group the "chimps" in this post because they see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil regarding the dollar, and are contentedly guided by the credo "Monkey see, monkey do." They follow the directions of their neighbors, whom at this point in time have been conditioned to consider Gold in low esteem. Obviously, this post is not written for the chimps--they aren't visitors to this forum.

Of the group of thinkers who see the problems with the dollar and the special merits to be found in Gold, we can divide them further into the physical "champs" and the paper "chumps." The champs are the ones who stand behind their thoughts by acquiring the Metal that they support in principle. This post isn't written for the champs, either -- they're already on the right track.

Hello, chumps. You guys comprise the sad group that is "so close and yet so far." Your good independent thinking has steered you toward the merits of Gold, yet you have undermined yourself in an attempt to capture additional paper through leverage based on the proclivity of me and my fellow champs to drive up Gold prices through our wise demand for Metal. Sorry. It doesn't work that way--as I (and many others here) have explained time and again, and most recently this past weekend.

What you chumps fail to recognize is that the Gold itself is the objective and desirable monetary wealth--as a safe and meaningful alternative to dollars which are subject to devaluation and collapse. And most importantly, you also fail to recognize the true role of your leveraged paper gold (futures) within the Gold market. The crux of this entire post is contained in the next two sentences, so open your mind and think objectively, setting aside briefly your indignance that words on a computer monitor have called you a chump.

Long positions in paper gold are NOT used, as you might like to think, as a "fire insurance policy" among institutions having vested interests in the status quo, whereby such a long derivative position would be expected (by you) to compensate them for rising Gold prices and weaker dollars. Instead, these institutions use the offering of paper gold (and its influence on price discovery) as a WET BLANKET to keep Gold from catching fire in the first place.(!)

By allowing yourself to miss the big picture, you are being played for a chump. The tragedy is not that you are throwing your paper currency away on paper gold, but rather that you approached so close to the brink of truth, and yet will likely have nothing material to show for your journey and efforts. It's not too late to stop beating your dead horse and take your place on the growing bandwagon headed down the Gold trail--that is, if you're not too consumed by your own pride and determination to stay with your horse until it regains its breath. My prediction is that the vultures will have your flesh too, because you'll let them.

Gold. Get you some. ---Aristotle

Snippet from above link (even the-Privateer is getting on the Euro for gold band wagon now):
-----------------------

Hello Steve,

I'm hearing more and more where various commentators are allowing for a change in this direction. Most of them still do not think it's a real plausible event, but can at least see the pressures building in that way.

When I said a few days ago that it was showtime, several major moves came out of the woodwork.

Paris, Friday, October 6, 2000 ------- ECB Raises Key Rate ------ 'We see no threat to growth'' from this rate increase, Mr. Duisenberg said. He said the euro-zone economy was at ''cruising altitude.''----- "the forces underlying solid growth in the medium term remain in place"-----

also:

Dubai Monday, October 09, 2000 ---------
Mr Jacques Santer, former president of the European Commission, has called on Gulf Arab oil exporters to price their crude in the euro rather than the US dollar as a means
to stabilize the oil market --------- "It could be the instrument to consolidate oil markets" and would be less affected by US foreign policy, he told a Gulf-Euro conference in Dubai. ------ "Trust and partnership spirit between the Union and the GCC could well increase if we were to consider trading the barrel in the euro" instead of the
dollar,-------- the future will certainly offer us opportunities for a move in this direction," he said, describing Europe as the world's biggest oil importer. ---------- "My contention is that the euro will move again toward parity with the US dollar by gradual extension of
the euro in international transactions"--------

Also:

BAGHDAD (AFP) - - Iraq's central bank has begun to buy european currencies, following Baghdad's decision to stop using the dollar, the INA agency reported-------Iraq's cabinet commissioned a team of economists on September 14 to prepare a study on the possibility of using the euro or any other currency in Iraq's trade instead of the Dollar.----

Steve,
These were powerful diplomatic thrusts and they received very little commentary in our media. Santer's proposal is "in the works" as we speak and will impact the dollar now
and for a long time into the future. It has to be appealing to the producers in that region because the bulk of their supply goes to EuroZone countries. Why do you think
Duisenberg is playing his hands off policy so openly now? Market traders don't have a clue to the "whys" of his recent remarks. They think he is some fool. He's offering them (producers) a completely independent currency, exactly what they wanted and lobbied the ECB / BIS team for during pre Euro formation. We in the US are standing on our heads trying to explain how the Euro has fallen against the dollar. Stand on our feet and it's easy for anyone to see that the Euro is fine and in a strong position. It's the dollar that has risen far above other hard currencies lately.

This whole scene is playing out in a fashion that will allow producers (and ultimately many others) to shift (sell) out of dollar reserves while it's over valued. I cannot stress enough how important this development is or it's influence on American money policy in the months and years ahead.
Everyone thinks "showtime" means a spike in gold. In reality, it's all about a currency war that is setting the stage for a crushing failure in our gold pricing mechanism.

I remember when we used to get post after post of Middle East experts telling us how the US had all these producers under their thumb. We would never allow them to raise prices, they said! Again, that's walking forward while looking backwards. In the early 90s desert storm era, this was true to a degree. But, I point out that the Euro was not available then and most everyone said it wouldn't even be born. Today, it's a whole new political initiative because money always talked louder than guns.

Here we are with $30+ oil (who of these poster experts would have believed it, back then??? MK knew!) and the prospects are for it to go much much higher. So, what is our heavy handed, massive influence in the region doing to change this? Well, we take a serious, strong approach in the matter to show the world just how much our US military might can buy in production increases: "we release oil from our strategic oil reserve"!!! OK! That should send a signal that nothing has changed in the affairs, right??!! We rule that part of the world, right?!

Steve,
the whole notion that we would back out of any military conflict in that region because they dropped our dollar is ludicrous. We must defend their oil production at all costs, no matter what currency they use. We simply cannot afford to allow that supply to completely fund EuroZone development at a cheaper price than we can get it for. That is exactly what would happen if we do not continue to back their governments and economic systems. Without free military and funding for
their economic structure's longevity, we would ultimately lose all influence in the region. This is strategic planing not discussed in the open by any of our want to be experts. For us (USA), keeping all oil, worldwide, priced somewhat par (in any currency vs the dollar) is extremely important to US vital interest. Both military and economic.

So:

Today, all Euro oil supply is headed to being priced and settled in Euros. This change will greatly impact world perception as to the value of holding US dollar reserves. It is a change that is now "on the table" and producers are not taking the decision lightly. Once the ball starts rolling, it's good buy dollar overvaluation,,,,, and hello US hyper inflation. Especially if we want to keep our DOW and
financial structure away from bookkeeping failure. Roaring prices for goods, yes, but bookkeeping failure, no! This is how a real inflation plays out!

ALL:

Again, ThaiGold, Traveler and others make good points, but these positions do not factor in the political will that's now in process. ThaiGold's argument that physical gold will be confiscated has been around for a long time. It has often been used as a reason to buy paper gold substitutes (mine
shares, ex?) because of their past response to such an action. But, today taking such a position is not working, is it? That's because it doesn't factor in the new "gold market direction" Another pointed to long ago. I only recently understood completely the ramifications of it. Anyone reading my Trails posts also understands it now. As far as to FreeGold and Legal Tender problems; our discussions about these items are numerous and date back to pre Thai days. Most of you long time readers have followed it as ORO, Aristotle and many others debated these issues.

Whether our paper price making markets take contract gold values higher or lower here is not the complete issue. The whole presentation is based on an utter failure of the entire dollar markets for gold as they now exist in paper form. The little physical gold that trades relative to the gargantuan paper trading today, will be completely overwhelmed as the dollar is transitioned from reserve
status. This "crushing of credibility" of paper gold will have an extreme impact on market valuations of all gold shares. "Semi hard money paper gold bulls" used to tell everyone that they would hold these shares through any crisis. Now we are finding out just hard their claim is in the face of the real ramifications of dollar destruction! The facts are that paper gold only functions well in "regular inflation's" like we saw in the 70s and 80s. When "real events" start marching our currencies into open warfare, paper gold is worthless. Unless you can hold them through a complete trading shutdown where their mark to the market value would be "ZERO"!

Many market watchers have always said that the battle was between the dollar and gold. That was true until another digital currency could take it's (dollars) place. We have been putting this private discussion in front of the public for a few years now. Recently with the help of Aristotle, SteveH, TownCrier, ORO and many others posters (too many to mention), Michael Kosares's USAGOLD forums are blazing the trail for all to see.

All of the many items ThaiGold posted today about government control of gold pertains to past policy in a different ""gold is official government money era"". The use of gold through that era is riddled with failure. In the future (see my latest Gold Trails) currency reserve competition will
require a country to keep gold free for private trade. Making price discovery a physical affair only. This will come about in a completely different atmosphere from today where gold is still manipulated as a world "official currency" asset. Mostly now manipulated by a failing IMF/dollar system. The next reserve currency, the Euro will not compete with gold and will require it to find it's
FreeGold value level. The US will have absolutely no incentive to controlling gold to defend it's currency in that era.

Traveler,
Hello sir! I certainly do respect your thinking and have agreed with some of it for some time. However, I believe that Another is very right in that "Events" are telling a different story than the one we are used to. I doubt we will ever see a real restrictive money policy in this country again. We shall see.

Sir, I know oil from it's "down hole operations" into and "far past" the influence of the old Texas Commerce Bank! If those" Cherry Wood" wall on the 40th(??) floor (if they are still there) could talk, some tail they would tell. Indeed!
But those days are long gone and far removed from today's
reality. I don't think we could have ever had a very private conversation at the petroleum club, it you did know me you would know exactly why. (smile) :)

Some people think I'm MK (hello Michael (smile)). Well, in my current time and stature of life, if two people saw a picture of Michael and myself, standing at "Roy's" for dinner,,,,,, You would most likely hear:

-------------
"OH! OH!, I know that one,,,, saw him on TV! He is in the movies!

"NO! NO! he's Michael Kosares, very famous and photogenic ,,,, but I don't think he's been in hollywood" ,,,,, Who's the other one ,,,,,, standing kind of in the shadow?"

OH! OH!, I know I've seen him before,,,,,, can't think of where,,,,,, Now I know,,,, saw him the other day ,,,,,,, He's Michael's ,,,,,,,,,,,,,, gardener?????????????

Hello and welcome to the golden vehicle upon which Apollo is the Charioteer!

Oh how much indeed does your driver's fame precede you, sir. Few here count a god of poetry, music and most importantly prophecy as their close advisor. (smile)

I enjoyed your post, as it's content showed no indolence of spirit. Certainly a quality inspired during your streaks across the constellation. Yes, we have all seen bright starlight before.

Apollo,
The political and social ramifications of the changes before us would take a large book of posts to discuss. Perhaps titled the History Of The World, vol. 6 thru 8. But for the benefit of brevity can we just keep it down to something in the order of a James Chavell novel? I think Gai - Jin (foreigner) would do. OK, I'll work on it. Nice to talk with you.

My spelling and punctuation is not right? I don't know what you mean? (smile)

This reminds me of an old reply someone put to me when I asked him to clarify himself on a strong position. "What do you want, he asked? Good flavor or good taste? Because you can't have both from me at these wages! (Ha! Ha! What a guy!) He later took time to explain everything.

You know, hearing every comment today and with posters comparing my speech here:

I used to give talks at small meetings all the time and they never complained about my spelling! (laughing again)

You see, one of you was right, in that I have never tried to publish or write anything. My notes from meetings are what I work from and they are an outrageous hodgepodge of foreign writing no CIA agent or secretary could ever crack! (still laughing).

I'm much more of an eye to eye, face to face, quietly making my position known, kind of fella. Take MK or Mr. Turk; these men can write. Im not kidding when I say that in their presents or in the company of other smart / important people I would typically blend into the shadows.

First and foremost, my reasons here are to simply keep the path warm until the real play comes into view. If my poor writing skills don't make things clear enough, it's ok because soon enough events take a hand and clear the path enough to follow. True, talking to me in person, you would say the same thing others do; "Trail Guide, you don't sound anything like you write"! (smile)

Well, that reminds me of the guy with an extremely large nose. He went into a plastic surgeons office to get his leg burns fixed and they asked if they could also fix his nose? He said absolutely NOT! If you did that, I wouldn't be me!

So,,,,, in that light,,, if I gave these posts to someone to edit, or had someone else translate most of Another's thoughts to english, it wouldn't be me. (smile)

===========

Holtzman wrote a good piece some time ago and I lost it's location. In it he made the distinction about how we were arguing about the difference between paper gold and physical gold, along with all our other debates. I think he said that it was all useless and some of us risked embarrassing
ourselves if paper / real gold spiked together. We should just diversify and watch the show, he said. ( I think that's what he said?)

To a degree I do exactly as he mentions, except that I don't trust paper gold at all when the going gets rough. Our differences is the same valley that separates PGAs (Physical Gold Advocates) from many modern hard money followers. It's a difference of "learning location".

You see, it all has to do with how one orients oneself in the world today. Indeed, understanding the word "orient" provides some of the answers. Interesting word, orient.

The old romans didn't have compasses and they depended on the position of the sun to gain location and direction each day. Every morning they would watch to see where it rose. They gave the name "oriens" to this location. In other words, the east. Later, "oriens" obviously a latin derivative, was slipped into english and it became orient. Not only was orient used to describe one's positioning in the world, it also referred to all the lands east of Europe. The Asians, etc..

In time, most of the world's thought could be broadly divided into Western and Eastern. How well one understood such thought and the people forces that created them, depended very much on how well we could orient our own thinking! Are you still with me? (smile)

For myself, I have placed my feet squarely on the ground that faces East to gain a better understanding. Because from here not only do the majority of the world's people live, there also resides most of the reserves of oil. Remember, "oriens" became "orient" and that traditionally was all the lands east of Europe. The Middle Eastern oil fields included!

Now, over time and across the space of human experience, Europe has become much better "orientated" to the "orient" way of trading and thinking than the West. To this end they will always meld better with them economically than the US can.

Indeed, this is something Mr. H had better "orientate" himself with because I suspect he is British. You see, I say this because only the Brits use "orientate" and that back - formation of a word has been in use there for about a century. Truly, plenty of time for him to understand why the Duke of Edinburgh once said,,,,,,, "the English are much more culturally and emotionally "orientated" towards Europe". Check it out for yourself? Perhaps that fine gentleman also knew the "oriens" from where oil did flow!

and that my friends is why their English paper gold is going to one day burn.

Now, did I get those letters and dots in the right places? (smile) I don't think so!

The Traveler (10/24/2000; 0:25:21MT - usagold.com msg#: 39771) Deflation Scenario II
Greetings and warm regards to all.

Tonight, I will address the inflation or deflation debate that was highlighted this weekend by the formidable and never to be dismissed Trail Guide. Forgive me as I tell you my view from 30,000 feet. Much closer and the details would get in the way of full understanding by many here.

First, I thank Trail Guide for referring to me as a smart hard money thinker. His companion comment that I and many others walk forward down the gold trail but are looking backwards is similar to saying generals always fight the last war during a current conflict or that you can't see the
economic pot holes down the road if you are always looking in the rear view mirror. Fair enough.

I however reply with a well-known admonishment from Lord Acton. This Cambridge historian of the 19th century wrote that those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. I have devoted a professional life and investing life to knowing "something" of economic history - both domestic and international history. My summary viewpoint as expressed @ 39423 is reproduced below.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The economic lesson is ... ... ... ... ... .

Deflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon -- a lack of sufficient currency and CREDIT in the economy to support prices. When the growth in credit slows or turns negative due to higher interest rates and higher default rates, then the above illustration [about the collapse of real estate] plays out.


================Mr. Traveler: conversely: the "real" inflation I point to is largely a cash phenomenon, where all the past massively over created credit instruments are brought up by the money making authorities and paid for with printed cash or allocations to the owners digital cash
accounts.================= more


Some wise ones here state inflation is the curse waiting for us over the horizon. I doubt it because we are already highly inflated. I point you to the NASDAQ's PE, home prices and auto prices for but three easy references.

================ Sir, your three examples are the beginning "price" results of our highly inflated financial credit structure. However, as I pointed out above, that structure today is in the form of "highly reproduced" (inflated) credit instruments. In addition add to that mix all the vast
paper derivatives in place and we can see how very different our present money inflation has been. Even as it only begins to raise prices.=============more


For hyperinflation to occur, even more credit would have to flow from Mr. Pump.

============Not true, sir. As your own examples pointed out above, rising prices in your examples above indicate how we are already receiving the effects of a hyper inflated credit system. Again, these are only an advance example of price inflation that's beginning to reflect the "real" amount of "credit money" we have created over 20, 30, 40 years. ============more

But to whom? The consumer is over leveraged already. The consumer has binged on easy credit to the point that debt service now takes more than 90% of disposable income for 80%
of consumers according to the St. Louis FED. See why the economy has soared. If the above illustration does play out, most consumers -- still anguished by their recent credit traumas - will avoid the credit trap and thus Mr. Pump will be "pushing against a string".

Remember, the consumer represents 65% or so of the GDP. As credit goes so goes the economy.

=================Good point! It's one we have used to explain why deflation in a credit inflation is always a real possibility. But, hyperinflation cannot happen in a credit society unless the credit starts being made into cash.. Our (yours and mine) "pushing on the string" scenario is
predicated on pumping more credit to those that don't need it.

However, in the real hyperinflation that's coming as it follows our current credit inflation phenomenon it's not the borrowing class that's liquefied, it's the lending class! Remember, out there in our vast dollar world, for every dollar a consumer has borrowed, some entity holds the other
side of the credit instrument. Our classic deflation begins when these holders are no longer being paid, resulting in the write down of their assets. Across the land, banks, credit unions, citizens with lend able funds and every other form of lender no longer own a credit instrument that's sellable at par. That's 100 cents on the dollar.

Hyperinflation begins when pushing on the string no longer is an option. As you pointed out; "the consumer is binged out"! But there is more (smile).

We would not embark into such an obvious currency destroying process if we could drag the rest of the world with us into a cleansing recession. Call it an "almost deflation" where we start the inflation / deflation circle over for one more credit cycle. This is our record from most the dollar's
life.

No country ever hyper inflates for the pleasure of the ruling class, as many want to believe. They / We inflate to keep the domestic system in use and do so because it's the last resort. In other words you are forced into it! Today, the advent of the Euro has created a currency competition that will allow world investors to run from any deflationary, restrictive policy the US can offer. Our
currency will be lowered to non reserve status no matter what route we take. Just as in many other historic examples and present examples around the world, nation states always choose hyperinflation when no other way out is offered. No nation on earth has ever cascaded themselves into deflation once they are off the gold money system.

Below Traveler addresses some of the very aspects I detail in the above.======================== More:


Our worthy Trail Guide declares in his fireside chat along the Gold Trail @ message 43 that it will be different this time. It may be but as Cavan Man, a Missouri resident, might say: "Show Me". In part, Trail Guide states:

The US cannot walk away from hiking our ""gold trail"" now. Because "this process" is one of the few tools available to them for keeping the dollar perception in a good light. In effect by slowing the currency transition process they are doing exactly what world dollar holders need the[m] to do.
They will inflate these derivatives until in effect; our modern gold market bankrupts itself as supply is exhausted. I say, good! (smile) But once we get to that stage, I expect that a super US economic downturn will ensue.[*] Then the fed will go wide open and cover everything in sight to keep us going! The ongoing price inflation will be driving everything from physical gold to real estate through
the roof.

[And a paragraph later... ... .]

Yes, it eventually breaks everything! But this is nothing new for us gold history buffs and it's what has happen in countless modern national fiats around the world today. Nations that don't have a reserve currency to play with. We will do like their citizens do, continue to use dollars but carry in our pockets whatever new reserve is in fashion, as a backup! Be it gold or Euros or both. In addition, our entire financial structure (like in these other nations) will change to operating in an inflation economy. Money will be lost, big time and made big time, but things will still be financed, brought and sold. Houses will double, triple then double again in price, even as financing rates
approach 35%, 40% or whatever. We will also follow the (then) prevailing world policy concerning physical gold, solely because it will make economic sense to our officials.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Do read the complete message for a fuller context and more vivid understanding. Your wealth and your grandchildren demand this of you.

Perhaps the point of debate between us is: (A) Does severe deflation come next at [*] above followed sometime later by inflation and eventually hyperinflation, or (B) Does the US go directly to hyperinflation? This debate has many, many dimensions and is complicated to map. But let's give it
a whirl.

ORO @ 39481 has stated that the FED will do the bidding of its owners (the banks) if events don't get too far beyond their control. I agree. Do banks and other holders of debt instruments (loans, mortgages, gov't and corporate bonds) want their wealth withered by hyperinflation? I don't believe for a moment that the creditor class is this egalitarian.

==============No Traveler, I doubt the creditor class as a group is seeking to remove the financial inequalities that separate people through this coming process of hyperinflation. Far from it. As I stated above, the credit hyperinflation has already occurred. It's there, in place as we speak.

What is now faced by this non egalitarian lending crown is the choice of: having their debt instruments defaulted on and losing everything,,,,, or playing let the fastest runner win the game!

My friend this is the choice you get when the currency your assets are denominated in hits the end of it's "timeline".

Human nature has followed this path for thousands of years. You know the old joke about out running the bear? Well, these lenders will influence our financial policy as such. They will try to get their debt securities liquefied first, spend the fiat and in this process out run you and I. Leaving anyone they can beat to the mercy of the hyperinflation bear eating their remaining fiat assets.

Your point above about deflation and then inflation is still valid; if we cannot get the borrowers to borrow more and in doing so stop the economy from serviceing "OUR DEBT SECURITIES",,,, ! But we cannot risk the markets, in this particular time and place to make that decision.

Here, we and the world would for the first time make a "judgment call"; ---can the "dollar fiat system" our wealth is stored in endure the deflation / recession that must
follow?---

To date, everyone stayed with the only reserve currency available. Tomorrow they will not because they have a choice.==================more

According to the IMF, foreign holders of dollars (including Central Banks) have a $6.5 trillion stake (roughly 60% in debt instruments) in protecting the value of their dollar holdings. Do they wish to see their purchasing power drop TO 25% or so under a hyperinflation adjustment

============Again, dollar holdings by foreign CBs are worthless anyway when the nation issuing them does and must run a constant trade deficit. The money can never go home, only build further on digital account.

This is the reason most Hard Money Advocates fall so short in evaluating our present gold values using only the commodity use of gold. They completely miss the fact that current dollar pricing of gold vastly understates it's wealth asset value.

Especially to CBs if their dollar assets dissolve in bookkeeping form, the way they would do in a hyperinflation. No, the billions in assets they hold in dollar debt instruments would not disappear, only be transferred through a massive devaluation of the dollar against gold.
================== more

or increase TO 175% or so under a deflationary adjustment?

=======================Again Traveler:
My above explained why a deflation cannot be in the cards. But if so, foreigners holding even government guaranteed paper debt in a deflating currency is little more than bookkeeping wealth if the actual goods buying power of the currency is compromised.

Yes, our US would continue to print dollars to service it's debt, making the accounts look good. But, in such a deflation situation, foreign exchange controls are a 100% guarantee. Foreign held dollar assets would not come home, at least not at the same exchange rate one needs to become
financially whole!

When the world begins to abandon a currency at the end of it's reserve timeline, deflationary gains on debt instruments are an illusion of bookkeeping. There would be no 175% real purchasing power gains allowed. ========================more



If those wise monetary strategists and Euro creators thought that the dollar would go "up in smoke", why do they continue to hold on to the US$ at an INCREASING rate of accumulation?
The ECB holds nearly 80% of its assets in US Treasuries (with 15% more in gold and 5% more in Yen). Is this the position of a shrewd central banker or wealth builder who is nervous about the future purchasing power of the US dollar? Why have not foreign dollar holders transitioned more
rapidly away from the dollar and into the Euro, gold and other vehicles that would protect their wealth from the confiscation of inflation and later hyperinflation. Given that its "ShowTime", one would think that the transition would be more complete than still having $6.5 trillion "At Risk" of going up in smoke. (Actually, it is "ShowTime"but physical gold is a sideshow in the unfolding three-ring circus). I suspect all those foreign held dollars are still in the USA because of an explicit promise -- Your dollars will increase further in value as we deflate the debt bubble and you are able to buy hard assets for dimes on the dollar.

====================Traveler, I addressed this in the above. Still, their asset base is safe in any circumstance.Their gold sales are largely to each other and much of the very gold they are delivering to certain clients will return for Euros once a dollar transition begins. Indeed, there has
been massive ongoing physical gold buys the world over. Who do you think has been buying all the gold non official "Paper Gold Advocates" have been divesting themselves of? The key to understanding the scope of this is in seeing through the dollar paper gold pricing system. Had the
prices of paper gold been rising all these years, it would have indicated a continued support of the dollar based gold markets. As such, the world today expects this currency system to fail, taking it's paper bullion markets with it!

These "shrewd central bankers" are no fool to the economic world nor the political world. The US is still a major military and political force and will continue to be for some time. Allowing the US to destroy our own system and offering an avenue of escape for investors worldwide is a master political play. Why dump your dollar reserves when such an action would make you the bad guy? Buy some gold quietly, yes. But, better to let your dollars dissolve and have your assets transformed by a dollar / physical gold devaluation. FreeGold will do just that! ======================more



To RossL, Nickel 62 and others, your question is thus answered. Those dollars sent overseas by the trade deficit have ALREADY returned to the USA in the form of capital flows into debt instruments (60% or $4 trillion) and to a lesser extent equities and other assets. This gleeful
repatriation of dollars is historically unprecedented and has been done for a reason. Like those of "Giant" domestic wealth builders whose dollars are now sitting in debt instruments, these instruments will be converted - in the fullness of time - into currency to purchase hard assets ("old economy" companies with captive customers, positive operating cash flow, little debt and little remaining CAPEX, or trophy real estate or certain other proven factors of production) once the deflationary spiral has exhausted itself and driven the price of all these factors into the ground.

ORO stated that the banks want the gold mines and telecoms on the cheap. The above is the process for setting up the BUYS of the CENTURY. Perhaps a real time illustration would serve us well at this point.

================= Your presentation shows a lack of understanding about how exchange rate risk works during unsettled times. Failing nation states that have opted for a fully """""fiat currency"""""" (the US dollar) do not simply stand by and allow ownership of everything in the country to be transferred to foreigners. Or even local creditors for that matter.

Truly, the vast bulk of overall debt assets standing against US credit extending institutions dwarfs our ability to service with real goods. Even at vastly deminished prices. These debt structures are held for further fiat accumulation only. Truly a Western Thought concerning wealth. Once an
economy begins to get into trouble, everyone flees these very instruments you stand by in your analysis. Truly, people understand political risk as it pertains to the fleecing of constituencies. It doesn't happen in powerful states and investors know it.==============more

In the late 80's and early 90's, some banks liquidated land at an average 24% of the then CURRENT appraised "Fair Market" value, incoming producing properties at 50% of replacement cost or about 60% of then CURRENT appraised value and residential homes at 81% of the then CURRENT appraised value. Less than a decade later, most properties had handsomely appreciated from the FED induced credit expansion. Boom then bust then boom is the age-old
cycle of wealth transfer TO the plutocracy.

========= These cycles end when the currency timeline ends! ==========more

Does the US Government want hyperinflation? A close call depending upon timing and how events unravel. It could silently default on its outstanding debt and contingent liabilities (such as EXIM and SBA loan guarantees, FDIC insurance, etc.) by passing out wheelbarrows of FRN ala Weimar Germany. On the other hand, so many middle class welfare programs (the Big 5 are about 48% of total outlays) are indexed to inflation. They could never be met from the current tax code which has indexed rate brackets -- Thank you Ronald Reagan!

===========This is exactly what many people see and are preparing for! ==========more


Many models have =======more of Traveler's examples of possibilities=====apostles of Jenny, Jerry and Ophra.

Physical Gold Advocates fear not. Gold historically has done ITS BEST during a deflation! Yes deflation. When all other assets were spiraling down in value because defaults soared and collateral sales pressured the prices of all hard assets, gold alone increased its value. It has no liabilities (no one to default) and is portable to destinations without domestic deflation. See Professor Roy
Jastram's The Golden Constant (Wiley & Sons, 1978) for a 416 year history of gold under four major deflationary periods of the past. If you are a bit lazy or pressed for time, simply recall that gold in the 1930's went from $20 to $35 during that deflationary depression. One caveat: All four
were under some form of the gold standard.

=============== OK, now you say: """"One caveat: All four were under some form of the gold standard.""""
Boy Traveler, that's some caveat! (smile)

Four hundred and sixteen years of history examples can be toppled by one little caveat. Truly, that little point is exactly "the point" for today's time!

Our modern dollar world has created a fiat debt structure money system of biblical proportions. Nothing like it has ever been produced in the annals of time. We got to this point because our money was gold in the beginning. Then we allowed our confidence in gold as wealth to grow into
the abilities of mankind to continue such a money system without gold. The result is a massive debt against every thing except gold! Every asset that exists in the USA is fully covered by such debt several times over. Either directly or indirectly through various official government debts.

There is simply no historic example in the history of mankind that shows where everyone surrendered their assets to satisfy such debt. Yet, this is the process you Traveler, fully well expects from a deflation. A deflation by the way, that no gold standard today says must happen?

Truly, had the dollar advocates allowed it to be devalued against gold long ago we would all know where we stand. Free trading Physical gold would have slowly risen in dollar prices in an ongoing process that would have taken gold prices into the heavens. But, it didn't happen and an imploding debt structure (caused by pushing on a string of consumer credit demand) will be "QUICKLY" countered with debt instrument purchases from the official level. The old 1980 monetary control act is already in place and allows our fed to buy everything down to your shoe laces in order to stop any debt defaults. ===========================more

Is not deflation the very outcome that the Austrian economist Mises predicts following periods of rampant credit excesses? Furthermore, if one has escaped indentured servitude (being a debtor)through hyperinflation, how likely is one to "re-up" by borrowing at floating rates of "35%, 40% or whatever". What could one invest in and reasonably hope to make a positive spread (return on investment) if this is your cost of capital?

============Well Traveler, if you go to just about any third world country today, there are many extreme examples of what "re-uping" is all about.

Further, deflation's following the credit excesses Mises talked about only happen when people believe the currency system will last and opt to stay with it.--- OR -- They escape the bad credit risk inherent in remaining in such a deflating system by jumping to another system of younger
stature. Still, it leaves the choice of hyperinflation as the only route after a fiat expansion.

When such processes unfold today, people look for security in a fiat. One that will back itself with gold valuations conducted in an ongoing nature. Something the US fought so very hard to avoid all these years!===========more

Let's try it again?

ALL:

HA! HA! Oh Boy!

I was just rolling up through the posts and came across the tail end of mine. I thought it was some kind of reply from someone else. I thought, what in the world is he talking
about with all that Rods business?????

Then I saw it was mine. Guess it was too long and got cut off. Don't know where the rods in the sky stuff came from? Must be those funny people in Colarado or is it Calf.? (big smile)

Oh well, here is the rest of it from where it went haywire:
****************

With respect to Trail Guide's "living in many, many lands and have witnessed and used such inflating systems," I would point out these key differences in economic profiles.

Unless he was economically alert during the last time a reserve currency "fell from grace" (the pound sterling following WWI), then the experience of Mexico, Argentina, Russia and other commodity based economies are not on point.

==============Well, the pound opted to have the dollar back it's "transitioned" currency so the effects are not the same. Further, their debt structure had not come anywhere close to what we currently have. So they muddled through. The same could be said for the dollar if it took the Euro
as it's reserve backer. However, comparing the debt levels of Britain then and the dollar now is like comparing a baseball to the universe!===============more


Furthermore, hyperinflation is difficult to introduce when a country's government, businesses and citizens are already overly leveraged and are having trouble meeting debt service obligations ($2 trillion annually as recently posted by ORO). Total debt in America is often quoted in multiples of
record high GDP. It is one thing for the FED to pump money vigorously into the economy. It is another matter all together for the banks to find credit worthy or semi-credit worthy users of this fresh tidal wave of liquidity. By some estimates, corporate America has already leveraged up from
a conservative ratio of 25% debt to 75% equity to a precarious 75% debt to 25% equity ratio. That is almost a 10 fold (1,000%) increase in debt!

============= Traveler, every time you bring another log to our "Gold Trail" fire, I pour gasoline on it and burn it before it becomes of use. But keep trying, sooner or later I'll run out of fuel. (smile)

Again, hyperinflation in our economy will (as I demonstrated in the beginning) begin with our government buying the debt from creditors and changing the terms of it's payment for over leveraged citizens and businesses. Further, a rising price structure of an extreme nature, such as this, quickly raises all wages and income levels. Allowing everyone to service easily what seemed like a mountain of debt before. No different than looking back to when minimum wage was $1.00 and now is $5.00+/-. Only happening on a super accelerated scale. =======================more


In summary, he who has the gold makes the rules. The creditor class -- both the domestic plutocracy and their foreign cousins, has the gold -- both literally and in the form of debt claims. They would rather convert their paper claims into foreclosed hard assets following a deflation and
at worst loose a billion or two from poor collateral valuations while reaping trillions in new purchasing power. That beats passively loosing 20% - 40% - 60% of the value of the entire debt portfolio from hyperinflation.

=============== Exactly who in the voting public do you think is going to sit still for this paper conversion? You,,,, me,,,,that man behind the tree? Ha! Ha! """NoONE""" leaves their debt claims laying around in a country where their citizens are being economically tortured by huge, all
consumeing debt claims! At least not without massive risk returns. That's why rates soar so high. You either run for it or take a big chance in staying,,,, most run if a stable medium exists. Providing that medium in either Euros or a Free Trading gold market is where the ECB / BIS can play the
good guys============more


Furthermore, if the word came out that hyperinflation was the policy of the USA, who would lend their funds for the prospect of receiving less purchasing power later? I for one would rather take my chips overseas to an economy that is stable and offered good returns for definable risks.
Domestic usury laws can only be raised so high and bankruptcy laws tightened so tight before the great unwashed revolt.

===============My feelings exactly!===============more

The major risk to the scheme of the plutocracy is a revolt of the masses -- whether politically through election of populists who pass legislation such as foreclosure moratoriums or violently though protests, strikes, lynchings, pogroms and the like. Thus inflation followed by hyperinflation will be instituted by the FED at the instruction of its masters once the fear of loosing it all exceeds the greed of gaining another prized asset on the cheap.

================Very good!=================more


Lastly, consider this. Current wealth of creditors only increases during deflation as each dollar now held becomes more dear.

=============That used to be true before the volumes of debt securities began to dwarf the universe. Today, most asset holders are true to nature players of the trading mentality. If inflation becomes the risk, they will exit the door in an attempt to out trade you and me (and that man behind the tree (smile))! Most of them will simply run up the inflation ladder seeking the next higher return. In the process marking the market down in existing holdings until the government must also buy those items at par. ===============more

Inflation is a wild card for everyone. For example, my one ounce Maple may be worth $20,000 or $30,000 once deflation is turned into hyperinflation (and former creditors have switched to being net debtors). But what is that $30,000 worth in today's purchasing power - $3,000 for a 10 to 1
return or $300 for a big waste of time and energy?

==============ALL:

This is one of the major flaws in Western Hard Money thinking. We tend to view the dollar price of gold in a static purchasing power light just because it's bookeeping priced through paper accounting deals.

Lost in our perception of all this is the fact that current bullion prices must rise into the thousands just to reflect the US credit inflation that existed 20+ years ago! Much less reflect it's value relationship to the current trillions of debt.

Our modern dollar paper gold derivatives have masked the true gold values all this time. Start with a base of gold holding it's international wealth value at $3,000 to $10,000. Then extrapolate that to handle any future money printing to buy our already hyper inflated debt! Now you have an idea why PGSs (Physical Gold Advocates) are so quiet as they buy bullion today.

The current marketplace has so understated it's true dollar value, physical gold must rise far beyond any price inflation that's in our future. Only Western commodity traders using a thought process that says; """the dollar market price of anything is correct because the dollar price says so"""" think gold today is a "one - on - one to price inflation" proposition. Nothing could distort the picture more. ==============more



Truly, what waits for us economically just over the horizon will be calamitous and stunning for all but a few.

TownCrier,

Thanks for explaining about the long post cutoff limit. I think in the future I will address other posts with short clips of their items in mine. Then none of these will get so long.

TC, I'm going to read all of your recent clips as they do address a lot of the things happening now.

I also want to summarize my discussion with Traveler as it came across too broken. I do accept many of his points but am really trying to explain clearly what forces are in play now that will alter those same.

Thanks for all your work, Trail Guide

Hello TG,

I saw your msg#: 39809. No that is not entirely what I said. I think if you read the latest James Turk article here in the USAGOLD system you will see different. He does a nice job of explaining some of it. You see, assets can go up very big in an inflation but still come no where near to keeping their purchasing power. I'll cover this more when I post a summary on the Gold Trails.

Two replies, then a story.

ALL:
I'm fighting a cold bug,,,,, trying to write a small novel of a reply to Appolo's #39611,,,, preparing a summary to Traveler,,,,,, and then I smell the stench of paper gold burning! So, I hurry up and look under my chair cushion (need a ladder to climb up and get in it now because of the mound under it) to see if it my gold bullion had also burned up in the flames,,,,,, it didn't. Boy, that was close (smile).

Mr. Holtzman, thank you for that reply and excellent explanation. I'm glad to see that you have "orientated" yourself into a position of understanding. My position in the currencies is a bit more thin in the diversity department.
I am now down to just the Dollar and Euros. Having recently changed the ratio far into the Euro's favor (around .88/.86). My advantage, of course is that I can just spend them there for any number of fine, much better valued assets if the dollar never goes south again. You know, in poker they say "anything is possible, it's just not probable". So, I do give the Dollar a .00000001% chance of never going down to Euro par again (smile).

I heard Eddie George is also becoming "orientated"! He went out of his way in Paris not to rock the dollar boat too much. Calling the Euro "substantially undervalued in terms of the medium-term 'fundamentals'. Oh boy, it must be killing them as the Pound is clearly in the same pickle the dollar is in and that trend is in motion.

Suddenly everyone must talk out of both sides of their political mouth and the ECB has got to love it. England / USA need to sell to Euro Zone or their already tiny profit margins are going to completely disappear. Not only that, the Euro exchange rates sets the competitive margins everyone else must mark against. Soon, if the dollar doesn't drop, taking the pound with it, we are going to have a very hollow backing behind an already sky high economic
structure.

To back up that contention, the same Reuters article said " Tuesday showed Britain enjoyed a trade surplus with the rest of the EU in August for the first time in almost five years, despite the strength of the pound versus the euro."! But then confirmed that "there is evidence that British
exporters have been cutting their prices in sterling terms to maintain their competitiveness in European markets in spite of the strength of the pound. That has hit corporate profits."

So, Americans openly display their strong dollar saying the Euro is week,,,, while knowing full well that EuroZone is outperforming on a long term basis and their currency is really strong in that fact. The pound is being drug up with the dollar, yet both countries know their money's overvaluation is a bad sign. Killing their markets.

It won't be long now and everyone will be talking out of only one side of their mouth,,,, and it will be saying drop those interest rates Alan, you must get that dollar down. Big inflation, here we come!

I bet the UK is into the Euro before we know it. They missed their chance (worried about a little minor inflation) and now will come up with some ad-hock tracking system, you watch! Eddie is already throwing off hints; "For the time being our best bet, it seems to me, is for both the Eurozone and the UK to continue to pursue macro-economic -- both fiscal and monetary -- stability in parallel" Did you hear that one? Trail Guide

ORO,
you have placed so much fine information out here and I never go into as much of it as I would like. I saw your #39804 "Debt to equity, according to Noland, is at 83%". Not good, my friend!

I'm doing an abstract fiat money example and hope to use it as a base to construct some discussion with you. It' so hard to talk here with everyone using such closely related terms, we often don't get our point across. At least I don't.

Story:
Was traveling a while back. I stopped and tried to tell a fence post (there are a lot of those scattered across this great planet of ours) that there is a difference between "the price" and "the value" of things when fiat markets are involved.

I said that the efficient market theory is skewered
when there is an unending supply of new fiat credit for people to bid with. In such paper markets, the paper money price cannot represent the real value of things in the course of our lives. Take away the ever expanding paper pricing mechanisms and replace it with a fixed amount of bidding units and the real worth of things in our lives becomes known. Of course I'm not just talking about gold vs paper gold. It's most all things, except gold is the most extreme example today.

Know what? That post didn't say a word. Just stood there holding the fence up. Either I'm dumb as a "____ post" for talking at all or that sun-of-a-gun is smarter than it looked.

You see, I think it knew something was wrong below him that we couldn't see,,,, because next morning he was at a
phone booth calling Colorado about something. This really happened!

The moral of this story is:

"you can't turn a wood post into paper then gold,,,,when even "knot heads" know it's rotten two feet into the knoll"

(smile)
Stranger, yes?

Hello Steve,

Well, it's never as bad as it all seems. Remember, people, nations and empires have been doing this from the beginning. We are, as a people much stronger and tougher than we think ourselves to be. Us Americans and all North and South Americans will survive and be better for it. So the
Europeans may come out on top for a while? Good for them. They are good people too!

As I said long ago; most everyone takes our thoughts as major gloom and doom. That is totally wrong. I expect the US to change, not die my friend. Great doses of reality force us into a better life, a stronger life.

Again, the secret to navigating through changing times is in not allowing others to control you. Indeed, 90% of that power comes by controlling your own financial assets. None of us has to lose to experience change, but we must change not to experience loss!

This chess game is a long one and we will have time to discuss this further. Until then, consider following a conservitive trail that puts you in control.

@ Trail Guide From your 'fence post' story,--------

Canuck, if I could deliver this message in 50 dialects, write 20 books on the subject and use every possible literary devise, it still may not spread the word in it's fullest understanding. There would always be people that must conduct a disquisition after reading and even then still never grasp it.

This is not said to disparage you, it's a recognition of the vast diversity of how our minds work. To reach a diverse group one must present their thoughts in diverse ways. You must already know this? In addition, some people and cultures grasp a riddle faster than plain speech!

The fence post story had many meanings, none of which were conveying a secret message to someone and certainly not inside info. The fence post analogy came to me naturally. In the past I have sat around campfires, under the stars, late into the night where the whole conversation involves the passing of riddles.

The use of "fence post" as in; "hard headed as an old post" or "dumb as a post", etc. is an old American wild west expression. Maybe even Euro/Asian, I don't know! It's often used today. During yesterday's discussions, I got the distinct impression in several of the exchanges that one of
them was acting like said post. The usage was done with that double meaning and also portrayed how wood is used to make paper and paper gold is traded for physical. Somewhere below the surface (post below ground,,, knoll) that which becomes paper (gold) was rotten to the core and even the (paper players, BBs, etc.) knot heads (as in knot in a tree or post) knew it. Stranger's only part in this was that I tied it to his "new fence" making he and everyone here talked about the other day.

Further:

So, you need to know my status in order for any of this to gel? Well I can tell you that a lot of high powered people through out the entire currency and gold world have had it all figured out for a long time. And they didn't mind telling you about how to play it with leverage, I might add! Yep, serious credentials, had they,,,, of a kind that one could just follow their thoughts without even a doubt. Know what it got them (followers)? Smack dab in the middle of a currency war and a very diminished portfolio to show for it.

Think of me as the garbage collector that you talk to every wed. over the back fence. That way I am sure you will not take what I say as an absolute. Like SteveH or Sharefin put it; they kept thinking (hopping) I was just a good story teller. You see, it's not knowing me or my level of
involvement in this that will make you any difference or do you any good. It's the process of turing around your thoughts to see all sides in this game,,,,,,, and that will place one in the best position to make decisions,,,,,in the end.

ALL: I willnot in a nutshell just tell everyone; Hi, I'm Mr. Main Man and I know the King of England, Frank Sinatra, Ton Cruise and Jane Seymor (no I don't really know them!),,,,,, and I am buying gold bullion so don't you think you should too? Not much of a foundation building in that is there? That's right, it's just a bunch of unneeded buildup that hollows out ones credibility far more than building it.

So, on this forum, in this format we bounce from point to point along the way and try to explain our reasoning. This whole game has a thousand parts and everyone wants to see their least understood bit discussed. Now, there are a lot of talkers on this and other stages and everyone has their
position to explain. Good! But in the end, all this discussion will get more and more distilled down into just one,,,,,, the right one. The one Another said that time would eventually prove. Knowing my private life (or anyone else's) will add nothing to further this learning experience..

I (and much more so Another) said one should consider buying just gold bullion and only gold bullion for what is coming in our future. Not any of the white metals, not paper gold, not paper gold substitutes in the form of gold mines, not even leveraged gold contracts from dealers. But every time we (or anyone else) said gold would soar, most listeners just heard that one "bit", then used their own understanding from the past, to further invest for the future.

Another always said to buy bullion in proportion to your understanding of the changing market! And that learning became relative to unfolding events. For anyone not listening that was a "forward looking statement". We were supposed to watch and perceive and learn how our new gold market was evolving differently from how traditional hard money thinkers thought it should. People heard "thousands per ounce" and their brain stopped working right there. They immediately raced to buy the same outdated products used to track gold advances in the past. They didn't want to hear the rest of the story, preferring to invest first and ignoring the points we further made. Didn't want to hear about what could happen between "now" and that "thousands per ounce" later! Knowing my background now, is not going to change those mistakes.

Now many "Western Gold Bugs" are deep in the mud with no easy way to reconcile to the changes we said were coming? Who knows? Especially as things keep progressing right along these lines. In their position it's hard to reverse yourself. If one sells out all his paper for bullion now, then some spike guns the stocks and such you just sold,,,,,whether a meltdown later happens or not,,,,, it's a
killer for you mentally!

I don't know exactly where it will go from here, never said I did. This could be the lowest point, futures stay together and track an easy advance over a month or a year? Or, as we have been driving home for a long time,,,,,, the political situation may develop into a full blown currency war. Then we may find official institutions literally dumping margin money into paper gold so as to sell gold paper worldwide. What all the "fence posts" out there don't realize is that a few billion in short margin can have the effect on derivatives of hundreds of billions,,,,,, and they just need cash to do it,,,,, no gold at all. Are they at risk of being called? HA! HA! You be the judge? If you got caught buying 2,000 contracts for example at $250 an ounce strike price (and even had the money to take it) would you stand strong for delivery if the price got hammered to $100 in two weeks or so? I don't think so! You would be like all the rest of the trading crown,,,,,, dumping your position and reestablishing,,,, over and over!

Further, at that point, everybody and their brother would know that a cash only fixed settlement was coming, because enough gold wouldn't exist to make everyone whole! That very thought would drive a premium into the bullion price that every paper trader in the world would swear was a conspiracy by the coin dealers (and bullion only dealers). I can hear it now on CNBC:

" Once again on Cemex, Landon and other major gold centers bullion trading (they won't say paper trading) was tightly controlled to limit the effects of what is believed to be manipulation of gold in Europe and by coin dealers worldwide. In an effort to help the market makers cope with the constriction of gold flows, trading is allowed for 30 minutes a week. During that time only some 300 contracts could be settled each day for cash at a fixed spot price . As a result of this limited trading, the premium on physical gold has been driven up well above it's real price designated on official markets. In some areas it's over $2,000 an ounce. Virtually shutting off all official center
gold trading,,,,,, on to other news!!!!!!

The above sounds like a joke doesn't it?

Lastly,

I have said this before and will again for the last time. I want all paper gold to soar. Such an outcome would be the very best thing that could happen. None of us hard money or gold industry advocates would lose with this. However, as a private individual I am not planing for that outcome. I am not, because of all the reasoning I have laid out in the past and will continue to do in the future.

Here we have eleven completely different country's and each one operating under an independent government. They all still have their own internal currencies and banking systems but set most or all of their trade settlement and pricing in only one currency unit. With all the in fighting and at odds views, how could it be expected to last? To this end I completely agree with all the negative sentiment people today have! I completely agree,,,,,,,,,the dollar will never work! (smile)

Can you imagine any success at all when these nations try to use such a currency scheme? The countries of Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Japan, Peru, Argentina, Taiwan, Venezuela and Hon Kong all have operated for 20+ years under a Dollar system not much different in effect than the new Euro Project is birthing today. In fact, most of the world has used this ad-hock dollar reserve system for a long, long time!

So when we hear all the stories and reasoning about how the Euro will never last, just remember, the very same reasoning was applied to the dollar's future a long time ago. It's still here.

On the main USAGOLD forum I saw a post by Salmon (he must be hiking with us today) that asked a very relevant question I want to expand on; "People conveniently have short memory. I remember not that long ago $US were trading 80 on the US Dollar index."!

Boy Salmon, I agree some of these people must have been too young to have fully financially participated in the great dollar scares of the past. Either that, or your are right that their memories are short. I remember endless articles, discussions and books that all pronounced the death of the Dollar as we knew it. Each and every thinker all saw that the dollar would fail and their forceful commentary made today's Euro bashing look like sweet cream!

Yet, the dollar made it anyway and for all it's incredible misuse and global hatred is still the most widely used unit in the world. Over time all the dollar bears had to simply "be quiet" or risk being totally discredited as it's value climbed endlessly. Remember the mid 80s when the dollar was off the charts, making today's strength look week in comparison? What happened people? Dollar debt, money growth, price inflation all never stopped. Slowed down off and on, yes, but stop, no way! Every reason why the dollar should have stopped was / is still in force, nothing changed.

The very same people that voice their views against the Euro today would have, using the same criteria, said the dollar is toast at half the debt level and political contention it now holds. But it didn't toast well did it? That's because the world's "political will" all came together and supported the Dollar's use for better or worse until something else could be formed. You can turn this "notion" upside down, sideways and throw it against a concrete wall and still not present a sound argument that can topple this as the fullest explanation of the matter. All the grand US economic explanations only sidestep explaining the negative monetary issues that have traveled hand and hand with the dollar through it's ups and downs.

Besides, listen to the bashers for their reasons as to why their own native currencies are still in use? Even after watching some of their local moneys change even more than the Euro. Kind of silent commentary in that sector, isn't it? They hate the prospects of the Euro and say their (Europeans) people will dump it, but I ask why do you still use the Canadian dollar for example? Why is that money still in your pocket but your discussion precludes that others (Europeans) will dump theirs. Use their reasoning against the Euro and one must conclude that no fiat currency today can last.

Our reasoning in advancing Euro success is based on what is happening, not what must not happen according to fiat trading theory. To use the position that the Euro will fall because the dollar has risen so high against it begs the question: why did not all of the European currencies fail in the mid 1980s when the Dollar soared against them then? Indeed, so much higher than even today?

========================

The Euro Story May Be Offering Something A Lot Of Paper Gold Investors Don't Want To Hear!

The Euro Project is changing the outlook for gold in a way many gold industry investor didn't play the game for. Not one of them ever factored in just how a reserve currency transition would impact "not only physical gold", rather the gold market itself as it exists today in dollar contract form.

It seems everyone was in complete agreement that any fall in the dollar would be bluish for physical gold, including myself. Yes, one day the dollar price inflation would return and bring with it the need for investors to once again buy all kinds of gold vehicles. However, as late as the mid 90s none of the hard money advocates thought of the Euro Project as a system that would change gold thought, use or valuation. The new currency was seen as just some new currency that would be tried out in another part of the world. Like a new Peso in Mexico?

But, Western traders had fallen asleep in their basic understanding of gold and certainly paper gold substitutes. Over the years, the very dollar system they expected to fail had been slowly transforming the pricing mechanism and the nature of world gold holdings. As contract gold was inflated to meet the needs of ever more sophisticated traders and hedgers, paper gold was seen as having a physical gold tracking longevity every bit as good as the dollar. No one expected the dollar to be displaced, so leveraging non physical gold in the form of dollar based contracts must be an easier, cheaper, more highly leveraged ticket. Sure, the dollar would be taken down a bit and price inflation will return, but the world was never going to leave this reserve system. In this stupor type reasoning, it made no difference whether real gold was behind the paper so long as it tracked the physical price. For confirmation of this reasoning, just visit some of the gold forums and listen to the traders. Even some on our forum are completely unbiased toward paper gold's worth. Is it no wonder that, in time paper trading grew until it became the physical price.

Again, no one considered what would happen if the dollar was transitioned away from being the reserve. Well, they must have thought; if it was to happen, what ever new reserve that came along would just offer the same paper system and we would all trade over into it. Wrong! Suddenly, the ECB has in it's charter the marking of gold to market, at what ever it's worldly price would reach and in Euros no less.

But, here, we have the entire American dollar based contract gold market predicated on a limited commodity price range policy, pushed by the US, that kept gold in a pocket of dollar valuation. Not allowing it to leave this range allowed the growth of paper only gold because the outside extremes of price risk (both bottom and top) was known. Now we have a real threat that the Euro could unseat the dollar and allow gold to seek what ever level physical demand may allow. Can you say, "unlimited risk"?

A complete breakdown of the worlds only current contract gold market would slam the dollar very hard, indeed. It would also completely disrupt and financially fail the entire gold industry. Most every player that is "playing for a move in gold" will lose his playing vehicle in a currency transition the system is not structured for "limited price moves"! Hence the reasoning for our "physical gold" only approach during the rough period ahead!

I'll close now, as we walk a little further. Then we can discuss what currency is "in abstract form". You have heard us say many time that the price inflation is already built into the Dollar, well, this will help you understand why.

Onward: next stop in a little while

The inflation is already around us!

ALL:

Let's stop walking and begin here by using one of Traveler's thoughts (USAGOLD poster).

-------------------------

"Deflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon."

The "Traveler" was absolutely right with the above remark. This perspective has been around for some time and describes to an extent our paper money dilemma. However, reading from a different angle would require another question; what kind of "monetary" are we dealing in"? Even better to ask; do credits in any monetary system always try to deflate?

-----------------------------

Well, in most kinds of fractional gold money systems there is an absolute end to the amount of credits (debt) that can be extended. Even when banks are allowed to make loans at some multiple beyond their gold holdings, eventually the relatively fixed gold stores in their vaults stop all new credit creation. Usually this process is quick to react as a shut off valve and creates somewhat of a deflation before the credit expansion impacts the economy too broadly.

So here we can say that "deflation most likely is waiting around everywhere, all the time", but it becomes most apparent just as soon as banks begin lending too far beyond the fractional limits that gold places on them. Somewhere between point A "gross amount of debt created" and point B "gross amount of debt created", physical restrictions force a stop to further credit creation. That forces the economy to begins it's failure response to service some of said debt. Deflation is then in the air. Most of you hard money buffs have heard this explained before in several variations.

--------------------

Today, fiat money systems operate outside gold's control and do it on two levels to destroy savings. Both of these levels work to pull wealth away from you in a way that's out of sight and out of your control . Further, the matter in which these processes are discussed tends to hide the wealth destruction by placing it's eventual effects as always happening more in a future tense. That's not the case and much of our presentation for physical gold now, is based on understanding how much a currency owner has lost already to said money wealth destruction.

---------------------

So, try to place yourself in a different position, using a somewhat abstract view that may allow you to see what is happening "underneath". In an off take from Traveler's above, let's try to look at a different kind of "monetary" to see if anything changes with it's use. First, we consider the fiat as it is in use now.

-----------------

Once we leave a fractional gold system, nothing changes all that much. In place of gold, banks are given strict percentages of credit creation that in some ways follows the same rules gold imparts. In a very basic sense banks can only create so much credit unless the central banking authority sanctions more bookkeeping reserves for them to lend against. In many respects, if those in authority kept to their strict rules, our fractional reserve paper currency system would work just like the above gold system would. We would indeed experience "deflation in the air" as soon as said lending limits are reached.

But in a fractional reserve fiat system, people make and break these money rules and use whatever advantage gained to overlord others. Some of us explain this by saying it's this faction or that faction doing it to all us in another faction. But power groups-are-us and indeed our whole political process is but the playing of factions against each other. So, I leave out the blame placing, preferring to see our actions as a people's will. Or political will in the end.

It seems that in our human experience, there is no end of reason why we should not avoid most losses and expand credit just a little more. War, special circumstances, social need, emergencies all add up to a constantly expanding debt system and changing the debt creation limits to meet those special needs. Simply put, a fiat system run by humans will not cut off the arm of single dynamic group when it (the system) can be engineered to cut off the finger of everyone! This is the monetary loss phenomenon we must understand and deal with today. It's the only deck of cards we can play with if staying in the game is a desire.

Every time excess credit is created it robs one of us of a finger of our wealth. Even though we cannot immediately see the general price increases such a money expansion creates, it's dilution of our own wealth is all the same and very real. As an example:

===========================
Work with me on this?

Say you owned a plot of land free and clear with a barn on it. You even had a deed to show it. That deed was a paper derivative of your real wealth holding, the Barn (and land). Worth at least $100,000. Now you may say that the Barn was yours and it alone represented your assets, paper deed or not. But just try (under current laws) to sell that land without said deed? No go, right?

Now lean back, close your eyes and imagine that deed as a type of fiat currency you own. Then, one day you try to sell the Barn at auction. You come to the auction house, deed in hand and offer it for sale. Suddenly, you find out that the county clerk has created nine other deeds against your land, placed them in the hands of others and those other deeds are also for sale by said holders. The auction takes place and instead of your one deed bringing 100K, the extra ownership forces your sale down to a real value you never knew existed. That being $10,000 as it represents your diluted derivative's share of the Barn pie.
===========

So what happened here? Examine not only the facts but your misguided emotions as well. You, as a fiat currency owner may for years own a currency (deed) that you know has a buying power or worth equal to 100K. Yet, all the while you were saving this money for later use, other money deeds were being issued by the officials. An observant watcher of the financial scene would know that other money was always being created, but even the best of us never fully feel that those other deeds apply to our portion of the Barn pie. In other words, from the beginning and over some 20 or 30 years, our savings were diluted away by the continued issuance of new money. We always feel, emotionally that we can sell our barn near full price. That we can spend our money for something that brings in our perception of that $100K in purchasing power. But in reality, once we enter the marketplace in mass, rushed on by a sudden recognition of what the county clerk has done, we find our wealth was diluted away long ago.

This is what Another meant when he said, "your wealth, it not what your money say it be"!

---------

Now open your eyes and think in currency terms. Why shouldn't we think our money is not holding it's value? The fact that prices are not rising only confirms that our part in the market economy (represented by Barn ownership) is not being subdivided, yes? No, the fact is that your wealth has already been inflated away by past currency inflation. You see, currency inflationist want you to perceive that your savings balance against equivalent buying power in the future, not today. The fact is that your deeds are being inflated and the value is lost, today! Never to be regained by gaining additional account balances in the future. The very extra balances you count on to keep you ahead, only dilute the pie that much further.

Are you with me?

The secret behind the over creation of fiat currency is in the fact that most of the holders have no way of knowing how much their wealth or buying power is being diluted. Except at auction! The auction that is the marketplace for all goods produced and sold.

Again, as long as the MAJORITY of owners hold the deeds without taking them to auction, the loss of value never shows up in the real market auction place we call "spending"! This is how a huge credit expansion in a fiat system hides the dilution. It entices owners to hold the deeds as near money in the form of interest bearing credit instruments. In this process everyone can lose a bit of a finger every so often and never know it. With all this background in mind I continue our discussion:

=====================

Once our regular fiat system expands debt well beyond a point where gold reserves would have forced it to deflate, our economy demands that we enter a constant slow debt expansion that stops deflation from taking hold. In this sense, deflation is always "in the air" the moment we stop adding reserves. The system slows down whenever new credit flow stops. At this point Travelers statement takes on more meaning and has an expanded context. "Deflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon because; we create the monetary ourselves and do it with no controls over our desires not to lose as a group". The dilution of all our money holdings is constant and real, yet none of us wants the system to tally up as long as we can slowly share the pain. Suddenly, monetary phenomenon is really a social phenomenon when Fiat is used.

At this point, one the dollar world has been past for some time, deflation is no longer the consequence of over debt creation. Deflation is now determined by our hand as we adjust the fiat reserve supply. Often, in order to slow things just a little before we start again the fed stops it's manufacture of deeds (err,,,,,, currency reserves). It becomes a cycle that many have identified as the inflation / deflation cycle. It seems to have no limits to it's life in our modern world.

But it does. At some point, deflation becomes a socially impossible event because the credibility of the money system is rendered second behind recognition of real wealth loss. Here, we will lose the wealth anyway, but our books will still balance. This is our future in a currency at the end of it's timeline.

Consider this a while.

Then I will summarize my reply to Traveler, using the above.

Thank You

Real Inflation

Good Morning ALL,

It's nice to wake up on the trail for a change. In fact, change is in the air on this morning so rare,,, do you feel the wind beginning to blow? I do.

The other day (back in town) I responded to one of a series of The Traveler's posts. His was offered on 10/24 #39771 Deflation Scenario II. My reply was on the same day #39784 and (because it was broken off) #39794.

Before carrying my reply further, I wanted to establish a base of thought for reference. This was done in the last two talks (see below) of this extended hike.

So let's begin today, Onward:

Early on in that discussion I said:

================Mr. Traveler: conversely: the "real" inflation I point to is largely a cash phenomenon, where all the past massively over created credit instruments are brought up by the money making authorities and paid for with printed cash or allocations to the owners digital cash accounts.=================

This above comment should clearly point out what we see coming on the horizon. Over the last 20 or 30 years analyst have always explained our US inflation process as being one of continued credit expansion. If the economy began to contract from too few credits being created, we speeded up the credit making machine. This has been true and is something I agree with. But after so many years and cycles of this process it has largely become a continuing operation that never stops or any longer slows. Such an evolution into constant money inflation has and does slowly change and condition our perception of it's dynamics.

Back then, many years ago, slowing the money pump may have entailed actually bringing the paper creation down to zero or even into a negative creation condition. But, in keeping with the explanations I have pointed out on the Gold Trail; currencies have "timelines" that upon close examination are really just an expression of the changing social expectations of the society that uses said currencies. Earlier on this extended hike we heard:

========It becomes a cycle that many have identified as the inflation / deflation cycle. It seems to have no limits to it's life in our modern world. But it does. At some point, deflation becomes a socially impossible event because the credibility of the money system is rendered second behind recognition of real wealth loss. Here, we will lose thewealth anyway, but our books will still balance. This is our future in a currency at the end of it's timeline.=========

This ending process becomes a natural "next event", not only in our minds but in our culture's actions. We no longer think of the currencies credibility as being at stake or even an issue. Now, well into an expectation that "expanding credit" is natural and acceptable because the world (and ourselves) needs more of it; just the act of slowing the increase is enough to trigger deflation talk and thoughts of economic slowdown. The whole process of what we once knew as "real inflation" the monster, becomes an acceptable, wanted event.

Yes, we lose the wealth into price inflation anyway, but our accounting tells us we are keeping up, so everything is ok. Gently, the notion of a slowing of credit creation is good, evolves into a constant rising expansion of credit that is not moving fast enough! This is the realm we have been in for most of this decade even as it has been masked by an overvalued dollar. Now we begin to move into the next stage, "real inflation". From my Traveler reply:

=====However, in the real hyperinflation that's coming, as it follows our current credit inflation phenomenon it's not the borrowing class that's liquefied, it's the lending class!========

Because so far it's only the financial structure that's been inflated, the rise in real good prices is just a partial reflection of the "account inflation that's all around us". Already it's built into our rising accounts and denominated in digital currencies. Yes, we have been beating price inflation on the books, but only beating the portion that's been reflected against our partially liquefied super inflated financial structure.

I the dollar falls, and prices start to rise, we will demand that our accounts continue to beat price inflation. The officials will grant our request by making sure none of this nations financial assets fail. Because our money has been built as a debt money system, if you only just carry or use dollars, you are part of the "lending class". The very class most point out that will demand deflation. Clearly, our holdings out vote the perceived evil "world order" that we fear will collect! A world order that is really just a reflection of ourselves in the money pond.

Maintaining our perceived wealth, if only in bookkeeping form will require these officials to liquefy everything. The recent derivatives bill now being passed in congress is only another step in this cashing out process. A process for us, that can best be described as; someone standing in an elevator while the building around them moves downward. In our eyes, our accounts (as the floors around us wiz by) seem to be going up as they beat a new rising price inflation, in reality the entire financial structure is going down as all the credit instruments from our past are cashed out by the printing press.

Further

This is why people run from what was once perceived as a strong currency and the social system that created it. This transition from "credit expansion" to "credit buy outs" acts to place real numbers into the economy and those real digital numbers will start bidding in the marketplace. Suddenly, as in my "Barn Deeds" explanation; everyone is forced to reconcile the fact that their previous buying power, held in various "credits in account form" never could equate to real buying in our truly limited goods marketplace. Their loss to money inflation was always with them over many years, just never quantified at auction.

In such a process, even foreigners, important people, bankers and such, do not retain their debt claims on society. They join in the mad scramble to sell out because they are just as unable to change the process as is anyone else. Deflationary gains never come to anyone that waits. From my reply:

=======foreigners holding even government guaranteed paper debt in a deflating currency is little more than bookkeeping wealth if the actual goods buying power of the currency is compromised. Yes, our US would continue to print dollars to service it's debt, making the accounts look good. But, in such a deflation situation, foreign exchange controls are a 100% guarantee. Foreign held dollar assets would not come home, at least not at the same exchange rate one needs to become financially whole! When the world begins to abandon a currency at the end of it's reserve timeline, deflationary gains on debt instruments are an illusion of bookkeeping.===========

Further

This is why we don't watch traditional banking numbers or official money supply Ms for future directions. These will become reactionary items, reflecting the coming changes well after the cashing out event begins to unfold. ORO pointed out in what I view as a good description of how out system will spiral in such an event. Over and over, credit will be liquefied in an unending circle. Parts of his post:
====ORO (10/24/00; 23:00:45MT - usagold.com msg#: 39827)
Trail Guide and Traveler - bankers liquidity
The banks themselves can not survive a credit crunch where more than 10% of debt is unrecoverable. That would wipe out the whole of the banking system.

In order to save the banks, the Fed must print enough funds to bring back the banks to a point where they are at least liquid, if not solvent. Meaning that as banks sell surviving assets to meet withdrawals

The market value of these assets from distressed sale will fall substantially below what it otherwise would have been. In order for the banks to survive, the Fed must pay above market prices for bank assets till bad bank assets are at a low enough level that they cover remainingliabilities.

Since the market value of bank assets (not the fictitious book value) under current circumstances (higher general interest rates and high spreads) is falling, while bank liabilities are still growing at an interest rate similar to that of treasuries, Bank capital is falling at 10 times the rate at which bank assets are falling===============
Even though ORO was describing a deflationary event response, once a real price inflation is accepted and expected by people at large, the rising rate levels force the government into this same circle of events.

Looking at all we can see today, "inflation is in the air" as never before. Expecting traditional credit cycle events to save our financial structure this time will be asking the system to do what no one wants it to do. The very best and clearest early indicator that a super inflation is upon us, will be seen in the next "one way" fall of the dollar from it's overvalued level.

Our system of hiding past dollar currency inflation within a falsely valued credit structure is about to break wide open from a falling exchange rate. In the era before us, understanding the failure of our dollar at the end of it's timeline will require little more than knowing the price of bread at a grocery store. High finance is about to be "distilled" down to it's true worth; knowing the physical gold price an honest bullion dealer that can deliver at the same.

Now, let's hike back into town to continue on the USAGOLD forum.

Hello Mr. Gresham,

Your $40263:

-----you are basically saying that the official targeting of a gold price was a game that could be played only until the remaining "goldbugs" woke up to the shell game, and stopped playing the Comex/LBMA markets. Betting their margins against officially-sanctioned and guaranteed margin
money.----------

You know, a certain amount of the action in these markets is very real and based on the give and take of actual legitimate metal trading. I think this is what gives so many of the convinced (paper = physical) paper traders fits in understanding how the other parts are little more than cash against cash bets. They don't see any of it going wrong just because someone is legally bound to deliver the goods. Yet, if push came to shove, there isn't enough material existing in the world to cover all this betting. The only way these guys will grasp it is when it all shuts down and settles at some forced fixed level while people outside the betting game bid physical prices through the roof. But, by then
these paper boys, along with everyone they talked into this game, will be out side, looking in.

In this process, large institutions can literally and very legally sell the daylights out of our paper arena with no gold at all. Hell, it's free money as long as the game has a currency to mark itself in. Mr. G, when you have a market that (relative to volume) almost none of the players execute against (take delivery), even when they are way ahead, it's a dead give-a-way that they won't execute when they are under water! You agree, right?

My goodness, even a lot of the mines settle their short commitments for cash and roll over to keep the game going. And they mine the actual gold! Some of the biggest (most vocal) Western Gold Bugs, run like mad to sell any bullion they get held up for in a delivery. They get stopped after last notice day, and unless the metal is for a commercial use, it's sold right then and there.

In this environment, one that has existed for some time, is it no wonder the major "political will" (in favor of the dollar) has such an easy time drafting paper sellers? Is it any wonder that with every player alive using their tools to dig this hole as deep as possible
(for the good old Red- White- and- Blue!), the ECB/BIS is standing back as long as able. Watching to see just how far (deep) we'll dig ourselves?

I have to smile when thinking how; one day, a few CBs and other dollar holders are going to place a serious bid on physical. Don't worry, at your age you'll live plenty long enough to see it (smile). They'll say, we want a little gold now. No, no paper, just all you got in your little warehouse. That's all you got? Good, take it all! Right now!
Ha! HA! Soo-Long entire dollar gold derivatives market, forever!

--------------------

You point out: -----Until this moment, I just assumed the paper gold market was a normalphenomenon of markets instead of a recent put-up job just to absorb physical demand, but now Ican't recall actually hearing of any other locations for it.----------

Good item Mr. G.! Stop and think and ask anyone that same thing. Truth is, the entire gold market on this planet is a huge derivative of just the LBMA! Even our Comex. They all mark themselves to dollar settled contracts and prices out of London. Just like oil. You want to know something
Another told me? The moment oil pricing begins it's full shift away from total dollar pricing, that very same moment, gold will do the same! Because oil and gold don't flow in the same direction, they can't settle in different reserves!
And if Euros become the predominate fix for gold, it will be based on predominately physical trade. What a change this is going to be, ha, ha!

------------(Hmmm... What a choice!) I should learn more about art works,collectible coins etc,---------------------

Mr. G., you read about the great German inflation's, read also about what they took when in Paris. When huge transitions of power mediums happen, money becomes things. Violins, paintings and antiques are good, but gold coins rule the roost! This idea about rare and almost rare old gold coins was not invented by MK or anyone else, the market made it so and will do so again.

-----------The boom in some real estate markets------------

Well, I expect that once "real inflation" comes to town, no one is going to have any problem holding onto their residential real estate. All other forms????? But individual houses will zoom right with the money meltdown and stay right with it all it's failing days. How long? Could take years.

But, remember, Real Estate will be hard to keep leveraged. You risk having the banking rules change as the whole economy switches into an inflation mode. Sure, houses will go up, but you may have to sell or refinance if it isn't paid up, full. In addition, houses will not come anywhere close to making you money once this starts. They will only keep up. Bullion, on the other hand must roar way way ahead, just to come up to the starting line! This is the real reason so many paper players cannot understand the leverage in physical gold today. But, boy, I'll tell ya,,,,,,, there are a few other quiet people out there that understand it.

So tell me, do you think I'm bullish on physical gold? Ha! Ha! (smile)
OK, enough for me, time for important things, gardening!


Good Luck, my friend

Euros here to stay
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=003718264633038&rtmo=aq9XJ6dJ&atmo=tttttttd&pg=/et/00/10/30/wger30.html

My points are:

Professor Hankel argues that the currency has failed to meet the key constitutional criterion of stability
--------but-------- Professor Hankel --------(is the same gadfly)----- who lost a court case to delay membership to the single currency two years ago,
-----------so-------------While embarrassing for the government, his case is unlikely to succeed.




Consider these good points:

The German government has recently insisted that the euro was bringing stability and growth to the economy, in sharp contrast with the instability of America. -----------

Hans Eichel, the Finance Minister, told MPs in the Reichstag that the situation was the best it had been for a long time. He said: Economic growth remains strong, unemployment will fall and inflation will stay under control." -----------------

Mr Eichel suggested that the real problems for the world economy lay across the Atlantic. He said that growth rates in America were unsustainable. The danger was of an American "hard landing" that would bruise the global economy.-----------------

Mr Eichel said: "You cannot have sustained economic growth with such a high balance of payments deficit and such a low savings rate. I hope this problem for the world economy reaches a gentle resolution.-----------------

As Mr Eichel spoke, ======= Washington was preparing to announce a rapid fall in economic growth from 5.6 to 2.7 per cent in the third quarter of this year.

Quick (but dumb) Question

Hi Leigh,
I'm kind of dumb, so guess that question fits my level (smile)!

You know,,, the world is awash in derivatives,,,,,,one of the biggest gambling paper schemes of all time,,,,,,and it's all based on the continued use and stability of the dollar! In fact, that is the one area no one ever questioned when derivative stability considered.

Now, suddenly we have a perfect setup and presentation of a Euro / oil trial balloon,,,,, using a country no one would fault for doing it (Iraq),,,,, and the US literally walks all over the heads of Congress,,,,,,,,,,, leaving shoe prints on their backs in the process,,,,, to get HR4541 passed????

Like Zenidea says,,, just couldn't have nothing to do with each other, right? ,,,, silly huh????

I think Zenidea smells the same thing quite a few others smell,,,, a rat.

Then we have smart Western thinking players like Goldhunter lining up support for investors to buy even more losing paper trades! Hello Goldhunter! (smile) Keep talking sir, this is all setting up very nicely. Yes, I still have those 3 December contracts for our experiment. Before this is all over, I'll be using your oratory just like some other people are using Iraq,,,, laying the groundwork for a big
surprise. Bet I play the game of chess better than you,,, specially political chess! (grin)

Now, if I can just get my French Sorrel to perk up in the herb garden, everything will be perfect. (smile)

Iraq gets OK for euro account
Iraq Gets UN OK for Euro Account


Hello Chris,

I hope you guys keep following this because it's eventually going to open the books of more failed derivatives than any law suit ever could. This is it, right here,,,,, the whole play being laid out in the open. How fast this moves dictates how fast paper gold manipulation is destroyed as dollar use shifts.

Did you notice that little blip in the Euro,,,,, almost the exact same time the HR bill was passed and the reality of UN passage in Iraq's favor. Not much, just a little tremor in the ground marking the floor of the exchange rates. Actually, the HR bill may also mark the lowest point paper gold can trade. At least there may be very little pressure on the downside from new supply. In fact, the much more ominous side of all this may now begin to take effect. That being where real,, serious,,,, gold bulls that really wanted
the exposure to demand physical gold, find themselves holding HR paper instead. If they start dumping contract paper into a demand void, the price will suddenly plummet into a trading suspension.

On a larger view, this could happen the world over in any derivative that was created as a proxy for other items of real use. Not just cash settlement. Tell Bill to keep talking, I know it sounds thin to say this but he has already broke their credibility backs just by doing what he has.

On a lighter note:

I wish you guys could buy physical as you unfold this story (smile). A little of that alone would pay the bills and make up for all the aggravation. Ha! HA! Next time you're face to face with some of the paper boys, hold a gold coin up and say "when this hits HR 10,000 we'll be even". Oh, they will laugh at you, but watch em out of the corner of your eye as they run to the bathroom after you are gone!
Ho! Ho! Ho! (big grin)

BIS/FED/Mr. Howe Revelations

Hi Cavan Man,

You make a good point. I thought a shift in American gold policy was in process summer before last, 1999. The fact is gold is still in somewhat of a range. Look at the (now old) IMF ploy, using gold at a market to market (marked to market) price and using it as a real currency asset. Can you
imagine, the IMF accepting gold as a currency payment while gold is not an international official currency anywhere? Now I hear they may do it again.

You are right, the US could be shifting itself towards the inevitable, a Euro / gold world.

I don't worry too much about the BIS being on the Anglo side of things. You know, boards all have factions within them and just because the US has two seats means nothing. The dollar ability to expand and represent all world commerce has limits and that board has know this for a long time. Long before Alan came on. They never wanted a "neutron bomb" transition, rather a recognition that it was time to go. The way our J. Welch is leaving GE. Nice and controlled.

But. the players have all taken the last stages of maintaining dollar use too far. They took the trend and ran it into the ground, especially gold. Now the only way to work it out will be some sort of cash settlement, but that is becoming sticky as most of that will be in dollars and dollars now look to be at risk.

The next stage of this will most likely come when the fed lowers rates in the face of our overheated economy and sets off a big dollar slide. Then watch oil line up, first behind partial Euro pricing, later followed with full pricing.

What a mess, yes? What an interesting event to follow.

Thanks

LeSin,

Thanks for the tip and invite. I didn't know you people knew anything about French cooking down there! (huge grin)

Watch those miners, they are really in a pickle now. If your dollar stays down as gold spikes they will be in a vise grip. The more time goes by the more I think good mine investing in the future will involve identifying solid reserves, selling equity, then never mining it. Just sit on it. Give us your thoughts and experience when back on line.

Request for clarification from Trail Guide/FOA

Hello Canuck Gold,

I think your handle is new here, so welcome. I can't keep track of everyone anymore, nor answer all posts.

In a very humorous way I must say: ---- It took me a while to scrape the thoughts surrounding your question off the floor. You see, we pounded that subject into mush on several occasions. (smile)

OK, your words:

-----1. The first paragraph above appears to assume *********** their prices do not appear to need much encouragement to rise. -----------

CG, It's my understanding that most every miner the world over uses various official and semi private financial institutions for ongoing business. They use regular banks, bullion banks, investment banks and government banks to sell and finance their gold trade on both sides of the transactions.

In many cases, their freedom to sidestep their gold sale contracts are severely limited. In fact, I bet just about every form of loan contract against them, whether in currency, gold or equity based, has covenants and restrictions that tie all the mines assets up in any form of financial dislocation.

Now, a dislocation can occur on the banks side as well as the mines side. If some of these BBs or other financial players get into trouble and must call their loans / financing arrangements for renegotiation, it can back-play into all the other tie-ins on a mines books. Most everyone thinks that in an emergency, with physical gold soaring, the mines will just be able to snatch their gold up and peddle it into whatever market they choose. Don't count on it. In a crisis, the banks will snatch the gold and they will peddle it into whatever direction they choose. And more importantly, they may force the gold to cover derivatives at what will be officially sanctioned settlement prices. Paper
prices that is. Because in the fine print, most coventants express what market is the right one to identify an accepted price! We shall see if my thinking is right?

You see, in addition to that thought, we also fully well expect that initially a locked paper gold price will be touted as the real price for bullion, while the free physical traded price will be labeled as having "premium robbery". In other words, paper may show $300 in a very limited (locked and controlled workout) trading enviornment while physical will be reported to be selling at $300 plus a
$2,000 premium.

Are you with me? Not a good situation for any form of paper gold substitutes, mines included. Will this happen, exactly? Good odds, my friend. We shall see.

---2. Windfall taxes have not been introduced following the recent jump in oil prices. Why do you assume that governments will impose grand fathered windfall taxes on gold profits? --------

CG, go back and read all the stuff about the Texas Railroad Commission. OPEC was modeled after them. The recent runup in oil was nothing compared to the huge rise that happened in the 70s. (price adjusted). Besides, let oil gun past $60 or $70 and see what happens. It ain't over yet.

Further, the value jump in gold we discuss is off your radar screen, I'm sure. The amount of rise will be huge and certainly drive a lock down on traditional mine to market sales. Yes, the free market in existence then will trade. But it will trade mostly existing gold and trade it because international competitive trade settlements will require gold to act as a non officially decreed currency. The US
will be forced to open gold for this purpose. But it says nothing about gaining the windfall of newly produces gold as a taxable asset. Sure, such a tax would mean nothing now, at today's prices. But then with gold in the many, many thousands, rigidly controlled mine production the world over will produce some mighty fine taxes. And don't say they (officials) can't do it. Oil production and price was very well controlled in US for a long time. It can be done with any asset that's ground based and fixed.

-------3. After suffering years of depressed gold prices, do you think that shareholders will stand idly by while governments confiscate their investments? -------

CG,,,,,,,No, I expect them to stand idly by while governments "tax" their investments! Hey, they do it all the time, what's new about it now?

---------Most of these people have suffered enormous losses and would rightly expect to be rewarded for their years of patience and loyalty to, and support of, the mining companies.----

CG, while I am sorry for their loss, this story has played out in countless industries from the beginning. My only comment is that had management promoted their product (gold) as something to hold in a 9:1 ratio above mine stock investment, the gold world may not have been able to arrive
at this moment. The paper gold game may not have ever got off the ground!


-----4. I just cannot foresee Michael Kosares continuing to trade gold in a quickly falling market because he would go out of business. ---------

Clearly, you underestimate the political will of having a physical market to survive. Truly, MK would do more business under these conditions. (Just my thoughts Michael, I do not pretend to speak for CPM)

-----The end game of your scenario would surely occur within a very short time frame and at some point, all gold dealers would suspend business until the dust settled with the expectation of enormous windfall profits to come. ------

Short time frame? Could be yes, or no! All gold dealers stopping trade? Some yes. Enormous windfall profits to come? Most private citizens are not in the business of mining a product. Owning gold is not a business venture so taxes are not an issue here. They are holding private property that
is no longer official money. Therefore, there is no incentive for the US to again treat gold as money again, like it once did. Private asset, yes! Money no! Perhaps the Legal Tender Eagle could be a problem, but it's not a big deal.

-------However, if a windfall tax was imposed on mining companies, how could a government politically avoid imposing a similar tax on gold dealers and individuals?-------See above!

ALL: One of the big roadblocks in the minds of Western investor is in the perception of gold as an asset in and of itself. They have seen it remain in a political value pocket for so long that they can only view the trading of gold as a means to an end.

This too shall change!

Hi elevator guy,

No, I didn't directly answer Leigh's question and if reading closely one can see I don't directly answer most questions. Yet, I somehow think my "subject title: Comment" got Leigh and others to thinking real hard.

Mr. Turl got it (hello turl): Trurl (10/31/2000; 9:16:51MT - usagold.com msg#: 40318)

Here is some clear wording:

The HR bill confirms a lot of what we have been pointing to: that all the massive paper derivatives created over this past decade are little more than leveraged bets of accounting.

All done to simulate a defensive position so people can operate in our dollar world. Therefore, supporting the view that dollar value and the world trade that depends on it will continue without entailing much currency risk.

Our position always was that:

Their (derivatives) value will go up in a cloud of smoke just as soon as some financial crisis demands their conversion into useable cash retaining it's value or end product. Yes, they will be liquidated for said cash, but this accounting cash they are turned into, will lose it's value to super inflation faster than you can blink or spend which ever comes first.

Within this mass of trillions in digital creations are our gold derivatives. Though much smaller in number than their currency cousins, their risk is "unlimited" in a real inflation crisis and could literally bring the dollar banking world to it's knees. These little items are the real object of the HR bill.

Why?

Because a real crisis in today's world will entail a dollar breakdown and loss of it's trade use that comes with such a breakdown. During this transition of currencies, the thinking world outside "Western financial perception" (much of Europe and Asia) will want physical gold, not just an
accounting lock on it's rising dollar price level.

Why?

They know "American Political Will" and how it reacts to real inflationary crisis events that appear on the horizon. Our HR bill is exactly such a reaction. It appears well ahead of the actual event it is replying to and is usually not understood by most investors.

Such a bill allows "hard money" positions to be liquidated into "cash only money positions" thereby delivering the owners directly into any paper inflationary fire without physical holdings that divert international exchange rate risk.

That means:

Your dollar holding values plummet, taking all their contract cousins down the same exchange rate river. While everyone defaults on gold deliveries because gold holders say "so sue me, I'm keeping the gold"! It's the only money asset you can't print.

The result is an ongoing official recalibrating of paper contracts that HR makes viable and is but one more confirmation that paper gold derivatives today do not equal and are not a substitute for physical gold.

Quite clearly one should conclude that paper gold will burn and physical gold will soar during the next crisis. I know because I now have Mr. G, Mr. S and Mr. R all on my side saying derivatives were never what we thought they were.

Are you with me, now? (smile)

-----If, let's say, I wanted to pay a plumber or school tuition or some other bill, could I offer gold and it be readily accepted? And would there likely be no tax on the transaction?--------


Hello Chris, Leigh,

You know, if I wanted to pay anyone today or in the future, I could offer just about any medium. Gold, silver, bearer bonds, cash, stock certificates, car, truck, boats or chairs would all work.

Gains taxes would be due and we all would report it. But you have to ask yourself; in our world tomorrow, with inflation running away wouldn't it be the lesser of two evils to have and use major assets that held value against currencies than not to have them?

Our whole argument today isn't about anything new to gold bugs. It's just about realigning our holdings so the paper money inflators do not take us any further into their paper gold trap.

Yes, physical gold will trade at super values, but stocks trade at super values today too and our life doesn't change all that much. If new capital is needed, we sell some appreciated stocks and use the proceeds. Today and tomorrow will be no different as we use the fiat for trade and hold the asset for savings. Ages old game with an new twist, at least it's new to us; use real gold for savings! So, what if one gram of gold is worth $300 dollars (or whatever) tomorrow, this same game is played out the world over using failing currencies every day.

Again, the great battle now is in seeing how Western understanding of Hard Money issues was convoluted by getting us into using an industry and it's paper product as an inflatable substitute for the real thing. A lot of people lost in this and are still losing. My point is that there is a way to catch up, square the books and get back as this all unfolds.

It's not glamorous, but then again winning a game isn't always about being in style. Look at me? Hell, I still have all my leveraged Western friends, even though I beat them all. They just don't know it yet.

Very sociable of me, don't you think? (smile)

------With such a dislocation taking place, the price of physical would explode further. And if governments can get away with taxing the investors, what makes you think that they won't introduce onerous capital gains taxes or other 'fees' on gold transactions? Could you please expand on your final paragraph to 'ALL'. How will it change?------------


CG, From my #40316:

---ALL: One of the big roadblocks in the minds of Western investor is in the perception of gold as an asset in and of itself. They have seen it remain in a political value pocket for so long that they can only view the trading of gold as a means to an end. This too shall change!------

CG, Governments aren't "getting away" with taxing anything. First of all, they do today and will tomorrow tax companies as needed. What assets are left over after the government taxes a company is what you brought in value as your stock holding, nothing more. Their gold in the ground can never be yours as all you own is the cash derivative residue left at the end of them conducting a business operation.

Every company in this country is invested "in" with this clear understanding. Real assets are nothing more than the cash they can produce "after taxes". The fact that traders bid stocks for takeover prospects or some notion that they are worth more than what they can ever return in real after tax earnings has nothing to do with real wealth. Remember, in a fiat economy, the market for anything cannot represent an assets true value, only it's inflated trading bid!

So, they tax gold mines X times. What's new? Suddenly, sometime in the future gold becomes a real international asset (not a currency) as it recovers all the years of it's paper price understatement,,,, and governments want to impose a tax on this new reality.

But, then international trade protocols change and requires gold to be freely traded, demanding it's worldly citizens can trade it on equal footing with all other invest able assets (only just not leverage able). So, they tax and control it's production. OK, we all paid too much for the end assets of most mines, based on this new structure? Well so too did investors in the oil industry once oil shot up in
the 70s. They paid fat premiums on the expectation that reserves could be pumped at increasing amounts and at higher prices. But they never factored in how governments would through the TRC would impact their stock's PEs. Almost the very same thing gold stock investors did, recently.

Did they prevent our access to oil? No, global competition and protocol cut off most government initiatives in this area. Even today we find there is a limit to oil tax amounts so as not to prevent free competition. I know this is not a real or valid comparison, but it does give you think food, no?

Further,

When the Western world returns to thinking and using gold in a savings perception,,,,, the way it was for a thousand years and the way major players think today,,,,,,,, and stops waiting for governments to ordain it as money before it can be saved,,,,,,,, the sooner we will be free the
shackles of fiat money control. Keep using fiat digital for trade, yes! Keep trading assets so as to keep up with fiat's depreciation,, no longer needed!

Rockgrabber Questions

Hello gidsek,
Nice work in working through the Rock's questions. I have one off the cuff point to inject.

My observations:
Why is it so many points are made referring to the Euro (or any other currency) not literally being backed by gold? Usually it's implied through the structure of the question or statement that somewhere, somehow, investors are buying Euros or expecting Euros to be strong again because it's "backed" by gold. Further, that backing description is meant as a throwback to official gold being exchangeable into the currency at a fixed rate.

Now, come on? That term "backing" is never meant to be taken that way. In that tense I know of no fiat backed by gold today. We all know fiat is not backed by gold today. The whole world knows that fiat is not backed by gold today. In fact, I have it on good authority that most of the
universe knows that fiat is not backed in that way by gold today (smile)!

So,,,,, exactly who or what group of people is this reference of "backing" perception pertaining to?

The truth is,,,,, no one! None of us see it in that light and none of us buy any currency thinking it is in some way offering a fixed gold return,,,,,, or even a limited fixed gold return!

How is it really seen?

If a military general is at war and walks to the middle of the battlefield to talk turkey with another general,,,,,,, his men usually stand with him. In the course of conversation he will point to his tanks on the hill as "backing" his men in battle.

--------and------------

No different than if you just lost all your money in a business venture and the banks are after your now broke self. Needing a little breathing room, you produce a certificate of account that indicates you have 60,000 ounces of gold bullion in a private vault in Argentina (or whatever) and ask if this gold "backing" me is worth anything to the banker?

Are you with me? I thought so. I knew so. (smile)

Sir Trail Guide @ "Aussie Miner's Pickle in Vise Grips"

LeSin,
Thank you for the URL. I book marked it and will study. Have a huge Herb garden and regular garden for all types of gourmet cooking. We entertain a lot. Always brought sorrel, never grew it.

Gold Miners

You know, I own some miners and so do a lot of big physical gold advocates. What separates us from most other mine investors is our long term view. Actually this (our views) is something the CEO worship us for. We pick them carefully, don't trade and hold for their rebirth value after the
dust settles. All the cock sure traders never would accept this before but now they are listening.

Eventually, even with all the destruction most mine stock values will have, their new value will rest on the profits they gain over and above production controls and taxation. Yes, gold will go so high that the mines will still be left with some slice off this super high top. And that slice will be big!

But, before running out and loading up, we have to remember that these are not savings or hard physical holdings. They are business risks. Right from the beginning we buy and expect their values to drop. How far I didn't know then and don't know now, maybe this is their bottom. At least for
the super strong unhedged ones? Yet, to maintain this strong holding concept and deflect the risk that was coming I hold in a correct "very low" percentage of assets and expect a zero valuation for a time.

If they run tomorrow, good. If they run from zero, good. I don't care. Now you see why most hard money paper advocates cannot stand the pressure when the real blow off arrives (as it may be now). The real event always was much larger and different in scope than the 70s precedent we all learned how to play from. Success in this hard money stuff is for real savers, not shoot the moon rocket riders.

I think most average people will be very surprised at how bullion reacts to the coming party. It has an excellent chance of keeping up with any mine holding or paper bet. It has an even better chance of gunning well past both of them. In the end, most people will lean back and ask, "why did I work so hard at this". You see, old Saud knew how to count his chips and let the paper boys wear themselves out. So do I, so should you. (smile)

Tree of Life (11/01/00; 22:02:53MT - usagold.com msg#: 40415)

Hello Tree of Life, and welcome!

Nice posts. I have a few points to comment on.

------Now how did gold get involved in all these. You may say. I believe the gold carry trade took on new meaning in 1995. Originally, it was the European banks legitimate way to earn some income from gold leasing but to ---------------

ToL, there are all kinds of explanation making the rounds as to why the CBs lend their gold. I agree that they did and do participate in some lending. But that was only in the beginning. It helped precipitate a market for other motives to hide in. We must look at the nature of the beast to
understand why it's just a smoke screen.

From the very beginnings of capital markets, no one lends their assets for free. Actually, I say it's from the beginning of time, but there is some argument against that one. Some people have even gone so far as to say that the banks lend gold based on it's booking value, around $50/oz (pick any low number if you will). Then, the 1% or 2% they get, based on the selling price looks good.

Then some tell me that gold is like holding Yen reserves and that 1% is about the same? Indeed, I know some of them do lend with this perspective, but that analogy is based on a very, very small reserve comparison and only a tiny amount of gold would be used to balance this.

Well again, none of these guys lend anything for free and that is what 1% is when lending in at least a 4% world. It just doesn't happen

The original "gold deal" as it first came into play involved lending the gold, the borrowers (BBs) selling it for cash and then they (the BBs not the mines) pooled that cash in a holding account. There it was held in interest bearing instruments, not delivered as financing to the gold mines. That pot of cash grew with it's added interest and became the ever increasing per ounce price the mines sold their production to in later years. Fulfilling their contract.

Having entered into these contracts that guaranteed a pot of cash to buy their gold production, the mines could use these contracts as fixing their profit margins to borrow money against and expand their operations. OK;, so this is how it started. I think American Barrick was the pioneer of this
back in 1986??

But, as I opened with above, this was just a lead-on sanctioned by the governments to create a market for paper gold dealings. All the rest that followed we have discussed endlessly. However, my main thrust in this is that the CB did have a political return to gain by starting this, it wasn't done for free.

Now, if this was a real lending operation with the intent to get some return on their idle bullion, they could have easily structured it far differently. As it is they lent the gold into a contract scheme that gained them far less then the actual rate returned. The mines would have been happy to create the deal even if it fetched a static guaranteed gold purchase for them. Thus giving the CBs a much higher return. You see, the mines motive was not to receive a higher than market price for gold, rather receive a stable price for gold so financing could be arranged. The fact that gold prices fell made Barrick (and many others) look real good and their staff stood for all the praise. When in fact
they didn't know it would work this way (back then).

Today, and over the last few years, with gold ever falling, all sorts of gold deals have bee worked out that have no connection to the CBs. A lot of it is completely outside the mine industry too. It's been carried so far that much of the stuff is just naked financing based on gold's price. The real return was in playing the official stance that gold must fall a little every chance it had to encourage
dollar settlements for trade. It's that simple. Drawing up a gold contract didn't have to have but a little gold selling involved and could be done just lending mostly fractional cash, borrowed at close market rates. The falling gold price did the rest. That's why so much of the value in a lot of current paper is worthless if gold rises. There is no physical to cover it! Why do you think they can trade
more paper in Britain than actually exists? What a mess, huh?

I'll tell you something else and this applies to Farrel's earlier post. All you have to do is dig real deep in that miner's papers to find where they must post more margin to back their deals if gold rises over $600. This isn't just my little guess, so ask them to see if I'm wrong (smile)? I bet that thing is back worded to include equal treatment for all creditors in a crisis and has an escalator clause in it that could take that whole co out if gold gunned to $2,000 in a week? Of course no gold delivery, just an accounting adjustment that would change some ownership. You see, they (and all the other hedgers) bet big time that the IMF/Dollar group could keep gold in it's paper price pocket forever. They never thought about what would happen if gold got priced in Another medium, a Physical only Medium!

HO! HO! HR 10,000 here we come! (smile)

Thanks

Foolsgold51,

I bet even my little saying in #40442 would get knocked off. Looking back at it they would probably think it was a slur against miners. It wasn't.

Mine investors slam the only people that can help then (physical buyers) while encouraging leverage traders to take short term plays in their favorite stocks. They say they invest in the industry for all it's positive fundamentals, then laugh at the fundamentalist for buying such a slow investment???

They want everyone (governments included) to stop selling gold, but when these gold holders decide to leverage up (instead of owning gold) the traders cry at how stupid the sellers actions are.

One quick post
Hello all,
I'm still working through a few private things. But, rest assured that I'll be back before this election is over.
I think (smile)?
You know, both Bush and Gore are good guys. I bet they are at least equal to the best members of your family "in laws" (huge grin)!

Below, I'm perhaps saying the same things in several different ways. Give it some thought?
--------------------

All of us are them,,,,, those two guys!

Looking out across this national stadium, filled with millions of people, I ask myself; "does everyone here, expressing their views publicly, understand that "they & we" are this society as a whole"?
Mostly, I think that deep down we do and our brash accusations are a form of posturing for our own self interest.

But, when some negative people speak or write the same challenges over and over we can't help not to place their private sincere position as being the same as their divisive public stance.
If that's true, then fortunately for the rest of us, large societies do act as a mass and the finality of their
political choice always drowns out these vocal few "trying their hearts out" to speak for "US ALL".

The citizens of this great land are far smarter than the media or many private speakers make us all out to be. I know, because I hear and talk to our "regular people" all the time, just like they were family. Ha! Ha! Many of them are (smile).

We "regular people" know a thing or two about real life and how it works---------
Truly, in western democracies, no one controls group think, even as many would have us fear that some power players can. We, like the great herds of buffalo of yesterday - year, move in a way that makes observers think a shepherd directs us. But just watch them media boys dive for cover when we go that way instead of their way!

So here I am,,,,, here we are,,,,, right in the middle of this, the largest mass of opinion in our human group. Feels good and safe here, doesn't it?. I'm happy here and think most all of you readers feel the same.
We all move together, sink together, swim and sometimes succeed together as a nation,,,,, for better or worse. Thank goodness we have so many around us that our strength is so
strong. In this light I always say; "god bless America but heaven help the world"! (smile)

This evil society?-------------
Why, it's us, we know it! So please, sir don't keep repeating Gore's and Bush's bad traits so loudly? You're talking about "us". you know.

Does anyone writing here think we as a political people are not an awful bunch of self centered manipulators? Ha! Ha! I didn't think so,,,,,, so what's the problem?
We take our own little self interest as far as possible until the larger mass puts a stop to it. Good! Because then we all become governed by the larger mass's self interest ,,,,,, and that becomes the strongest trail we can follow ,,,,, as a group ,,,, for better or worse. At least they create "our" lawful order, as bad as that may be. And in that structure we live "kind of" peaceably, even if it's not the same moral choice for all of us.
Still,,,,, bless this nation from sea to shining sea!

In most modern western societies political power has no strength without wealth and that's good. So it takes us off our usual course of chasing money for a while. That's ok because their control of public wealth is not conceded to them without a good fight and a good fight comes second behind this winning the majority of human support first. So, during these brief power transfers, the nature of, control of and longevity of any particular nations wealth assets is subjugated to lower status while winning the greatest number of votes comes in on top. Not winning the support of the most moral, mind you, just getting the votes any way one can. It's a terrible way of doing things, but that's ok,,,,,,,, it's us! We accept that privately when no one is looking, right? I thought so. You newcomers to this, that think it's all so unlawful, remember, we been doing it for over 200 years.

Taking this high ground for a firm footing----------

I now point out and ask; "no leader can ever do everything promised, nor can they accomplish our agenda while being everything moral for the greatest mass of this self centered nation,,,, So why do we place them upon a platform that not one of us can stand on ourselves"?
Yea, I know,,,, you already knew it's the best we can do and the best they can do. I thought you grasp that.

But, reverse the tables in our current presidential election and ask yourself; "would Mr. Bush not do the exact same thing Mr. Gore is doing? Don't answer that out loud or someone will hear it in the other room (smile). If he (Bush) didn't, then he would not be fighting his best to represent the best thrust of our national will. Right? So why can't Gore scratch and claw for all he is worth?

You see, we expect, demand and need a leader that is most like us. So don't be presenting Gore or Bush as something they cannot be to the mass that eventually places them in power. If you do, then your opinion does not represent the greatest strength of our nation. That being;

"the power of a people to govern themselves by finding a leader strong enough to win this no holds bared fight, for the support of most of us good people".

Ruthless? You bet! But knew that already, didn't you?

Crooked? Yes! But knew that already, didn't you?
Moral? Probably not! But knew that already, didn't you?

Honest? Only to the extent that our desires will allow him to be!

So, myself and the greatest majority of Americans I stand in the middle and say;-------
"let the best person win the hardest fight over the longest mile. We demand it because we are one tough bunch to govern. So be it and good for us"!!

Further:
As a national family we choose to shake the walls of our house as we please and damn the outsiders looking in! General Patton said it best: " Americans love a winner and won't tolerate a loser"! Indeed, when this is all over we'll all be winners, like it or not.

Closing---------
I say to my fellow Americans,,, my good friends and bad;

"put up your dukes and let's go for it,,,, after all I'm the best neighbor you ever had or ever fought with ,,,,,, Oh, by the way ,,, how are the kids,,,, God bless you and yours ,,,,, and do you need anything from the store,,,, I'm going that way?

---from one of "us" that's just like "them"---

thank you all for reading and happy thanksgiving

An analysis for the time ahead.

The Perspective------

The world is not going back in time for a repeat of gold's historic money function. The future of gold is before us and that future holds it as an asset of great wealth, not a currency for everyday spending. Indeed, it will be more than money, perhaps a wealth beyond money!

Hello friends and readers:

For many long years I have been following this new evolution in gold. I have also been following how that evolution is changing Western hard money thought. It seems that our new gold market has only now started forcing hard wealth investors to reconsider their long held beliefs about bullion vs. substitute gold. Many of you, have also followed the Thoughts of Another from the beginning and have recently concluded that this evolution was not only a long term process, but as much political as it is financial. With years of those early writings under belt, it's easier to now see where "the events" Another spoke of, always were "fluid in political dynamics" and their impact upon the gold market's structure left little firm ground for "historic investors" to stand.

We are, today, still standing on moving ground as a new monetary dynamic works it's way through world financial opinion. Not yet completely understood nor is it often spoken of in proper context, it's effects are, all the same, very real. Half of that dynamic is the ongoing destruction of the paper currency system our entire house of wealth is measured with, dollars. The other half of this evolution is within the "transition to" and "development of" the next paper measuring system our trading economies will use. Yes, as this process is played out in our time, it seems that the Euro will perhaps be the system we will all one day use. This transition will have a tremendous impact, not only on physical gold value, it will dismantle the way gold is traded for decades to come.

Our part in understanding this--------

For the casual observer and participator in this evolution everything around us, that is financial in nature, will seem to blur as events write new rules into our once static money history. I believe this storm will become worse as many paper assets are buffeted by it's destructive winds. During this time the transition of currencies will place a more proper price on all the paper values we now hold to be so true.

In this light we should know that our real things in life will not change all that much. Your tools, chairs, cloths and cars will remain yours. Houses and land, TVs and boats, all will retain the exact same "value" they always had. What will change is our ability to use our currency and paper assets as a medium to measure the "real value" that's always so inherent in these items, yet so well hidden in our perception of today. Yes, the currency price of things will greatly change, even as their "use value" moves little. Such is the nature of dying paper money systems. Such is the ending of a currency timeline!

We of Western thoughts and values---------

The world of "Western thought", of all things financial, that we have lived in and with for so many years, was slow to evolve into it's current state. Over time we came to accept that; because "paper assets" were so often used to measure and price the "trading value" of real goods, that these paper items must be equal in "use value" to these same real goods. Holding one's wealth in CDs, contracts of delivery, stock ownership and IOUs of most every form; all constitute owning "trading value", not real ownership value. Never were they equal to the real wealth itself, for only during long-term, major inflationary expansions of money substitutes could such a fraud be hidden. Further, it could
be better said that the "trading value" our fiat money system places on these paper assets is more of an illusion immersed in "conceptual economic value", not the "use value" real ownership implies.

Yes, it's true that accounting books say we can convert all these various paper holdings into their "use value" by just selling them and buying real things. But accounting standards fail to evaluate what a "world money medium change" has done in the past and will do in the future to the holders ability to "convert and buy". As in the past, the world will deliver "real things" against "paper trading assets" as long as the medium is accepted at par with "use value".

But once a nation's medium of exchange is placed in transition to Another nations medium, and subject to revaluation, wealth denominated in the failing over expanded paper mediums must be delivered as "more of the same currency" in place of real asset settlement. This is the true face of hyperinflation.

Behind years of massive paper wealth creation, there is never enough domestic production capacity to settle "in kind"! Relief in the courts from the fraud of real goods settlements reverting into paper settlements is rare in hyperinflation; as "fair value" is often seen as also being the same as "a fair value in legal tender". During such periods, legal tender can buy equal "use value" if only the real ever changing world values would just hold still. It never does because the more intense the transition becomes, the more intense the exchange crisis and the more quickly real world values (costs of goods) will move away from the paper holder.

Reading Western Thoughts---------

Truly, there is a big difference today in Western views of holding wealth, from the "gold coins in your pocket era" from the past. The longer it has taken the marketplace to challenge these differences the more human opinion mutated them into one in the same. We see this perception firmly grounded in written opinions today. The security of holding gold substitutes in leu of physical gold has never been stronger. After 30+ years of children growing into adults in a Western paper world, only delivery default and gold industry bankruptcy will change such paper minds.

The new future of gold is directly before us as our changing money dynamic will find paper wealth illusions running in circles. Paper assets will continue to set the price of things even as the currency price of things rises faster than paper wealth can reprice the same. Round and round we will go as our system outruns itself and strains to match the illusion of past paper wealth creations against the real world of taking delivery. Stranded on the money trail of past precedents, millions of investors will lose fortunes by holding what they thought were gold substitute assets.

Nowhere will this process be more vividly seen than in our physical gold markets as they reemerge from a total paper default. During the initial default stage, the entire gold industry as we know it, both paper trading and mining, will utterly fail to perform it's function of tracking the real value of physical gold.. But once the smoke is cleared, physical gold will first soar beyond every other asset medium, both precious and not precious, then it will be at the starting gate with all other real things. Then it will again run the fastest race against the onslaught of hyperinflation.

Nothing will change the trail we are now on------------

Today, at the end of a long history of dollar use, we say that this currency's timeline is ending. We repel from the popular thought, perhaps common thought, that some foreign political order is killing the dollar. It's easy to use war like terms to describe the dollar battle as one side losing the fight against another. I, myself, use it often to make a clear point. But, in truth, it's out of context to present the transition that way. Truly, the dollar is dying from it's own old age and it's debt burden is the final disease.

The arrival of a new system to take it's place will eventually take on all the appearance of a victor plundering the vanquished. Perhaps this is the way it will be played out in our media. Indeed, the stories will be ripe for telling as investors caught holding "dollar system" dependent paper assets will no doubt paint this transition as unlawful. Perhaps even avoidable, if only somehow the right team was at the helm. Yet, reversing this timeline change will be like stopping a surging river at it's historic height of flood. Still, history is perfect in showing that no government, team or individual has ever controlled a transfer of wealth measuring power on a scale such as this. Never has and never will.

So the evolution of hard money opinion will continue and much of that change will be witnessed as the timeline ends and people learn from watching and talking. Much of that evolution will be presented on forums such as this. Some on each side will line up with their wealth bet on their best perceptions of the outcome. Perceptions built on the solid ground of history, but riding our "fluid political events" of today. It will sweep us all down the same river of evolving money history. Down the surge we go, some drowning as they cling to paper based hard wealth illusions, others surviving the trip with the heavy weigh of physical gold for ballast. All in all just continuing the interesting journey we call life.

Thoughts spoken with a background of coming hyperinflation--

It's almost impossible to compare our (FOA & Another) outcome of all this to other opinions because we have built our actions and testimony upon the one-way flow of this timeline transition.

We say "one way and one way only" and waver not! Own physical gold and position one's other
interest with regards to a changing reserve currency dynamic.

Most every commentary written that is somewhat at odds with us, uses a foundation of a continued sound dollar financial structure as it's base. Be it; deflation alone and / or deflation with some return to a gold exchange standard OR a total failure of other world bodies to reach for other acceptable alternative structures. Some say a little inflation will arrive and lift all boats within a "more of the same" dollar world. Indeed, their boats include a paper gold system and it's ongoing use by the gold producing industry. All of these concepts are yesterday's outcomes and will be washed away in this great storm.

We say the timeline is ending and will do so in a great transition of dollar use. None of these other opinion's positions can reconcile the dollars inability to compensate it's debt load at par based on it's exchange for the goods of daily life. Truly the economic structure of the US cannot now, nor ever can in the future pay the costs of supplying real goods as payment for it's debt. We, as a financial nation, have gone that far over the cliff.

Even the most unsophisticated player on the world financial scene will agree that their wealth would be subjugated to a lower par of matching the US's output ability. Today's paper wealth, if held during any pay down period of deflation or the further debt expansion a "little more inflation" would require, will be substantially destroyed. I allowed to happen, the dollar would be dumped in an accelerated fashion as a world trading medium. Indeed, the world today may float in the same economic trading ocean and our goods exchanges may depend on a somewhat level sea for movement; but we no longer all float in the same "medium of exchange" boat.

Yes, it's to everyone's advantage to see the dollar transitioned with the least disruption, but to think that our international governing power structures are all in bed together begs the rhetorical question; governments only represent a following when their private constituency's debts can be settled? I submit that the power structure that offers the best dollar debt transition settlement will receive the most support and use of it's currency bed.

A new reserve currency with gold valued at super high levels will support debt transition into that next currency system far better than a restructure of real US economic production repayment ever will. Such an avenue of escape for investors and world traders completely cuts off any attempt by the US of engineering a deflationary landing. Such a landing can be explained and distilled into many esoteric forms that bear little resemblance to a classic deflation. But all, in the final measure, require deflation and a lesser settlement of debts. It will not happen.

In our time and for the first time in the modern US dollar history, the US will embark into a classic hyperinflation for the sake of retaining it's own lessened dollar for trade use. As destructive as that might be to players in this financial house, it is better than immediate total economic failure. It will evolve in a form much like the course of any other third world country, if it's currency too was suddenly deprived of world reserve status. We will, like people the world over, learn to live with it and live in it. Truly, our dollar and economy will not go away, but it's function, use and value will change dramatically.

U.S. and EU Economies May Be Moving in Separate Directions
http://www.iht.com/articles/5686.htm
Hello Everyone,

A while back I had to stop writing. Several important things have taken most of my time and continue to do so. I let MK know of the uncertain nature of my continuing these discussions at the same volume level as in the past. But, as time presents itself I will update as able. I hope to bring up to speed several past discussions that were left cut off.
To do this, I'll have to conserve what writing time available by posting on the Gold Trail "as able".

Here is a very good writer that has offered an excellent update of the Euro situation. Please enjoy his clarity. Link is above and a portion below.

---------------------

U.S. and EU Economies May Be Moving in Separate Directions
William Pfaff International Herald Tribune
Friday, December 29, 2000

" " The explanation for this emergent autonomy of the European economy would appear to be the creation and coming of age of the common currency, the euro. Before monetary union, European exchange and interest-rate policies were largely dictated by the defense of relatively weak
currencies.

This usually meant maintaining national interest rates at levels that depressed overall European domestic activity and growth. The EU countries' economic policies were indirectly determined by reaction to U.S. policy on the dollar, formulated with reference to U.S., not European, conditions.

A pluralism of economic power has been on the way to restoration since the Europeans established their single market in 1992. Its achievement would mean that the world economy has two strong and autonomous supports, and that now seems nearer than ever before." "

Greetings and salutations to all posters and lurkers of the best Gold site on the entire Net........Many thanks to everybody for all the great posts, with a special thanks to FOA/Trailguide for sharing his monumental mental acumen with all of us.....Anyway, I nearly spewed out my coffee this morning as I read.......

GULF COUNTRIES TO CREATE COMMON CURRENCY

Leaders of six oil-rich states Sunday approved steps to issue a unified currency. The move is part of a plan by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates for a regional currency and a unified trade zone.
It is designed to help speed up free-trade talks with the regions biggest trading partner, the European Union. Currencies of all the countries, with the exception of Kuwait, are pegged to the U.S. Dollar.

As the old song goes...."Signs, signs, everywhere are signs"........I thought I had read somewhere that top EU officials were in the Mid-East over the weekend....2001 is off to a Golden start....

Euros: -- the breaking of dollar derivative gold! ---

Randy,

Thank you for the comment yesterday on USAGOLD's main forum.

I have to say that everything is working out well as the new "Power Euro" begins it's displacement of our dollar. Right on que, the gold derivatives are taking a beating as that portion of the dollar market is dismantled. Hyperinflation, in most dollar economic zones will eventually gun gold much higher. But, not until gold has out-run everything on the planet so as to get to that inflation price starting gate!

It seems people will learn about "this new gold market" in two fashions; they buy gold and await the dollar / derivative failure or they buy substitute gold (mines and derivatives) and watch this entire dollar gold structure sector get destroyed. Either way understanding will be gained.

I know you have opted to own real gold while watching this all unfold. Truly, physical gold will explode in an unbelievable fashion once the Euro has supplanted derivative gold trading with physical gold trading. A process that allows us little time to buy more gold as derivatives descend. The wash out of trading in paper gold could take their paper values to depths unseen. While a virtual explosion in physical buying, happening at the same time, will make the physical run-up un-buy-able during the first several hundred percent.

If it unfolds more slowly than this and starts from these levels, "good for physical gold advocates". But, as I understand what is happening and the political preasures in force, physical gold is about to become the only portion of the gold sector that will perform,,,,, and perform as no other asset in history ever has!

Oil producers / backing Euro Zone development / backing super high physical gold / will change the trading dynamics and gold perception as never before. Between then and now, those gold substitute players, who are waiting for past historical paper performance to lead the way, will be forced into financial oblivion. All the while betting on a paper horse they thought was a Golden Arabian.

I'll have more as able, on this trail, our trail into the future.

Michael and Randy, today is a very good day! A very good day, indeed! (smile)

-- surprise rate cut was in the works. Any other rabbits up your sleeve?------

Hi Randy,
Your post made me comment!

Ha! Ha! Allan blinked first and a small few knew it! Picture him and the ECB standing head to head, not moving an inch. He moved and now the dollar is lost. With all the quick short covering on the stock and currency markets, "noone" noticed how much the long bond got smashed.

------ A 30-year bond fell a whopping 2 10/32 to 111 2/32 to yield 5.48 percent -----

Now our strong dollar support system is fracturing away. This year the dollar will lose it's reserve status to the Euro. Or at the very least share it. Nothing is going to fall again as a "Real" inflationary bias begins to build in our dollar world. Stocks, real estate and even basic economic activity will all feel the effects of a super dollar expansion. Done only to keep the dollar status somewhat in the game. Deflation will not be allowed. Nor will the gold derivatives markets be sustainable in dollar terms. Everyone in the world will be selling paper gold short in an effort to make some hay as it's structure crashes. It's called piling on!

This move by Allan is as important as the Washington Agreement because it marks the first time we are forced to action by a "competing" financial system. This game is well known to some and it's outcome is being positioned for. The Gulf producers, Europe and the BIS have been doing so for many years.

Back to Trail Marker #1

Hello ALL

Before starting our hike, let's review an old trade.

A while back, I left a marker on the Gold Trail so we could one day return to examine some old footprints:
FOA(5/25/2000;2:54:39MD- usagold.com msg#23)Trail Marker #1

For the record, as I posted several times, I'm not a trader. Nor am I a futures trader, even though I have traded almost everything there is and done so before many of you were born. With this perspective of me, not being a naive newcomer, lets recount the trade.

A one time poster here made a bet to show that paper gold was better than real gold:

BTD (5/23/2000; 16:01:57MT - usagold.com msg#: 31098)
""I just sold my Krugerrands and bought futures contracts""

Well BTD,

Because so many of these "bets" are done and never openly followed up on, I thought I would copy his actions in real time with real money. I did, as reading my msg#23 above explains. I dumped a portion of gold in one quick sale. I must have got unlucky, because my offer of 300 Krands hit a down moment and sold at $270oz. that day. Some called me out on this and said I was building this example unfairly. But, you know, in real life, in real trading, often unfair things happen as many of you can understand. The rosey paper bets never do in real time what they do over an after dinner wine! (smile)

I used the sale proceeds and brought appx. $81,000 of t-bills as margin, then brought (went long) three (3) Dec. gold contracts at $283.30. (I mis typed this as 383 in my post, but most of you reading would have known this). I got around 6% on the bills while waiting.

About six months (Fri. Dec. 01) later I traded out (sold) my 3 contracts before being delivered against them (stopped, in broker jargon). They were "sold on close" at $268.60. I saw no point in buying 300 ozs. of warehouse receipts for $283.30oz when an order for 300 Krands could be had for around $271 at the time. Ironic that they were only around a dollar above what I had sold them for????

Anyway, the math (I hope I type this right?) works out roughly this way:

After liquidating my margin account, I had lost:
$14.70 oz on the futures (283.30 - $268.60 = $14.70)X 300oz = (loss of $4410.00).

Then my interest on the 81K amounted to $2,430. +/-

which made my loss appx. ($1,980.00) (less all commissions we can easily round it out to ($2,000)).

SO,,,,,,, I sold 300 krands for $270,,,, after a few months my $81,000 had become $79,000,,,,,

of that I couldn't buy back the 300 rands at the new price of $271.

Wait a min! I would be short some 8 ounces and all for what?//

Boy, the convienence of holding paper gold is sure expensive! I didn't want to roll this over again by buying another out month!

The truth of the deal is that if one must trade, it's often better to just trade physical with a good dealer (I know I saw one somewhere on this page?).

The commissions are in the physical prices already. At least you don't get hit with a paper blitz that amounts to nothing but added loses. All you newcomers remember that a lot of the bark about paper trading is just that ,,,,,, bark.

The guy telling you how to do it couldn't do it himself so he want's you to pay a commission so he can play a game (with your money) that beat him long ago.

Besides, as the evolution in gold moves on, just owning physical will do it all without any trading and the gains in wealth will be staggering.

Here a few quotes from BTD's post that can now be seen in a different light:
----Two weeks ago I sold 300 Krugerrands and transferred the funds into my commodity trading account and bought 3 gold futures contracts. This is my preferred way to hold gold. In my trading account, I invested the margin funds in 6-month treasuries (earning 6.05% interest), and used these treasuries as margin to buy 3 gold contracts (unleveraged).------

---In this way, I earn interest on my money, yet still retain full exposure to movement in the gold price (I have my cake and I'm eating it too).------------
(TrailGuide note: HA! HA!)
-----In fact, in some ways, one can consider this as lower risk than holding physical gold: futures contracts require a low commission (with the right broker) while physical purchases and sales cost a high premium charged by the dealer;---------

----I earn interest on my treasuries, while the holder of physical "loses" the interest he could have earned.------

------The reason I'm telling you all this is to provide an alternative perspective to the bulk of the posters on this forum.--------- Well, I AM a trader, and I don't believe FOA/Trail Guide can foretell the future any more that the $5.00/minute psychics on late night TV. Trail Guide is a very articulate and thoughtful commentator, but his ideas are just theories like everyone else's.----
Well, all I can say to all the BTDs in the world, is that your big trades lost you (and anyone else that followed it,,,, me too) a few ounces of gold. I could have just kept my krands and not been any the worse off. In fact, I would have had a couple extra thousand of wealth in my pocket.

Like Another, my Thoughts are "free as the wind". In fact, $5 bucks a minute is cheap compared to the loses the BTD paper boys sell you.

OK,,, now it's time to head for the Gold Trail,,,,, the Physical Gold Trail,,,, that is (big smile)!

Either today or tomorrow, with comments on the last several days and the new currency directions of the Gulf States,,,,,,,

as able!

The Perception Of Gold

Hello everyone!

It's been a while, so let's build a fire and plan the walk.

-------------------

Long ago I was given a stay at the Paradise Lodge, up on Mt. Ranier. During the summer this volcano, outside Seattle, is a favorite for mountain climbers training for other big European and Asian mountains. Many other day hikers also take the high trail above 10,000, just to say they did it. Some go much higher!

On a clear day you can pick a nice spot close to the Lodge and watch the climbers work their way along the trail. Way ---- waaayyyy --- up there, they look just like ants. Often, clouds bellow in and envelop the troops for a while as they disappear from your lower view. It often becomes scary as we can see when they are disoriented and start off in the wrong direction. Sometimes only a few steps separate them from a chasm of disaster.

--------------

This is also the way I feel watching us walk the Gold Trail. Just like from Paradise Lodge, I have a different view than many of you. From where I stand, I understand much of what is ahead. Yes, a lot of us have been up this trail before, but this time, evolution is moving the mountain and bending our common path.

This time my friends, I tell you, the risks are ten times greater and the drop-off much more sudden. Indeed, we are but ants on the financial mound from where others can see us. Like the mountain walkers, thick fog also fills our thin air. So gather close to the fire as we check this worn map and mark the changes I know are ahead. But remember, before knowledge there must be understanding and before understanding there is perception.

Truly, as peoples, we can know nothing if perception cannot separate "real" from "illusion".

----------

Hello PH in LA, I read your #45071. PH, nice construction of the way it works. However, roads do curve. Here are a few of your items so as to extend current perception:
----- However, last I heard, there still existed something called "delivery notice"; the day on which holders of contracts must declare their intention to stand for delivery. ----------

------ I declare my intention to accept delivery. At this juncture, (as the system is presently functioning) I would eventually receive my gold.-------

------Now, for a physical market to open up separately as FOA forecasts, the paper based futures market would have to vaporize instantly. Otherwise, anyone noticing that prices were higher on the physical market, would merely opt to stand for delivery and sell the delivered gold there. Far from causing the futures market to fall farther, it would merely explode higher as investors took delivery at Comex and sold it on the new Euro physical market.-------------
-----------

PH,
A financial structure, such as our old 20+ year paper gold market, is changed by the force of currency traders reevaluating their use habits. Such structures do not rearrange themselves on their own. People use a large economic backdrop to create their perceptions of the worth of paper contracts. At this point our current gold pricing structure is built on physical values constructed on our currency's viability as it functions in it's current economic structure. The inability of contract performance is not "priced" into this structure, yet. From gold mine sales to bullion bank dealings, paper gold is accepted as physical even if it changes hands a hundred times before it's zeroed out in paper exchange. All done without bullion conversion.

It will be our changing "economic backdrop" and "it's restructure" under an evolving reserve currency that shifts our and our institution's beliefs past the point of "contract viability". Dollar price inflation, while impacting gold prices later, will not be the initial trigger that guns gold into the thousands. Many are waiting for this new dollar drop to kick off the next gold bull market.

It will, but Another dynamic will happen first.

It will be the inability to reconstruct the present volume of paper gold into a new reserve currency, the Euro, that breaks the gold pricing system. It is at that point, where the inability of our dollar biased gold structure to perform a currency reprice or make delivery at all, prior to transition, that will cause us to discount the value of all "future gold" against "instance performance". In other words, "on sight spot purchase and possesion".

What all that means is that physical gold, "on sight", will start trading at a much higher price than any form of contract gold. From Comex to Hong Kong to London, workouts will be required prior to real delivery. Even the normal "contango" of interest, built into these contracts as higher prices for further out months, will not begin to overcome the new "price discount" on paper contracts. That pricing discount will at first be in perception only. But later, as the fear of non-performance builds, bids will reflect this perception. Once the massive OTC gold markets begin to demand various dollar to Euro workouts, prolonging delivery times by offering cash extenders, "perception discounts" will gain legitimacy and become "factual discounts" based on "understanding".

As I said before, in other posts, this whole act will be presented in the media in different lights. The first priority in dollar land, will be to promote the legitimacy of the dollar paper pricing dynamic, no matter if gold is delivered or not. It will be labeled as; "dealers are making huge profits on physical gold by trading it with premiums far above the london markets". Long after most of the paper rules have been modified to shift the majority of contract gold into cash settlement, the paper prices will still be reported as the "real prices". Not the other way around.

--------------------

PH, when you say: --- anyone noticing that prices were higher on the physical market, would merely opt to stand for delivery and sell the delivered gold there-----:

No, in our real life currency evolution, it's the other way around. When the perception builds that all gold trading and contract structure is shifting to another reserve currency, all of us know the derivatives will not / cannot be converted at par. Mostly because the extended dollar is debted and expanded far beyond it's current usage. The real world dollar assets dwarf andy comparison to a new currency system. The only way to "par" your exposure is by doing the well known impossible, taking delivery. That is a dynamic all of us have been positioning for for years. The only paper owners that are not worried are the ones with an economic good that demands satisfaction, in gold if needed. Oil! The rest of us must bolt towards the closest "par" conversion first. Real gold.

Indeed, "Big gold Traders" don't stand for delivery when there is a possibility (certainty) of cash settlement. Especially in the near future, when the big big bullion banks and exchanges must set in motion a "trade for liquidation only" rule. A rule that basic physics will demand and the courts will back as long as the settlement currency is "legal tender". They will and it is!

To get physical gold in such an enviornment, you must sell for cash and do your buying on the physical markets. But, as we all know, noone will "par" their transfer when even cash settlement is at a 1,000% discount to physical trading. Welcome to the real world of a currency crisis no government can control.

Note: PH, did you think we were playing for peanuts (smile).

My friend, truly, this is but one portion of a huge international dynamic, in place, that will change our perception and understanding of gold. Even change it into knowledge. Truly, gold will once again become "The Wealth Of Ages".

The aftermath of this will leave us in a physical gold trading world for the rest of out time. It will, by default be mostly done in Euros. Mr. G. (one of USAGOLD's good posters) noted that his perception was that we could all just buy Euros. Well, I have, and the Euro will be the next digital transactional currency holding reserve status ,,,,,, and it will eventually be much higher than the dollar ($10.00 = E1.00??).

But most of that exchange rate will be a function of both an inflating reserve Euro against a hyper inflating dollar removed from reserve status. Prices will rise in all currency systems around the world as the Euro eventually expands it's coverage everywhere. There simply is no way to undo 50+ years of dollar inflation without unwinding some of that into our real economic price structure. The price of folly does not go away. This is where gold was planned to return and to be part of a wealth structure without being a currency,

This big difference from our present dollar /non gold recognition reserve, is that nation states and individuals can / will contain their lost wealth in an official free market in gold. Gold production, everywhere will eventually be extremely controlled with citizens reporting unofficial mining in much the same way as people report each other to the IRS. But, make no mistake, miners and citizens will all benifit. All mines, both big and tiny will make huge profits on the limited production allowed because the price will be so high. ($30,000+ in dollars (big smile) But, the road between here and there will more than likely price mine owners close to zero, first.

You see, gold will be a major wealth / saving asset to just about everyone. Not a currency. Make no mistake, $30,000 dollar gold divided by ($10,00 to E1.00) Euros = E10,000 in Euro gold. Gold moving to this level over the next number of years will allow the Euro reserves to cover it's issuance in a duel asset world. We will all save both Euros for interest and spending and gold as permanent wealth.

"Noone", not even our oil producers will control gold wealth, it will be sold and lent as a wealth medium, no different than Real Estate or Factories. Just not lent and spent by bankers as currency. Gold will never again be able to act as a trading currency in our modern digital world. We have tried that on various gold standards and even presently using this failing paper gold market. After the default that's comming, no nation or people will not accept such a deceit again.

Yes, corrupt governments will still have their way with fiat money. But, for our immediate future we will go this rout first. Truly, even the dollar took 50+ years to kill itself. So too will the Euro.

Remember PH, yesterday you could live a good life in Spain (smile) even considering all their money troubles, using their currency and saving dollars. Tomorrow we will also live a good life here in the USA. From Florida to Oregon, we will use a declining dollar and, just like in other nations today, own gold and Euros. Why, I bet life will be better than in our youth. At least for those who know a good gold dealer (big smile).

The perception that you can not "afford" gold at higher prices will give way to the understanding that we "earn" the "wealth of ages" at any value. Trading excess dollars for gold at, say $5,000 will meet no more concern than paying $25,000 for a car. Just wealth in a different form.

Now, see what you have done? I am out of time and must finish these other comments later.


PH, Michael, Randy, Everyone,,,,,,,,
Yes, Jan 04 was a good day!

Comment
Hello ALL!

I hope to post again tomorrow. Will then comment on several posts given over the last few days.

USAGOLD (Michael) (or Randy),,,,, I could give some names of banks that offer Euros? But I think CPM could/should advise most any client as they do gold business in Europe.

For Americans that are non-residents (or simply don't have a place there)of the Euroland Zone or England, an Offshore savings account in Jersey (Channel Islands)or Isle Of Man would do fine, I think? But there is far more to cover with this than I would ever get into in public. Again, CPM is the place to ask these questions and seek direction.

24 hour hike.

OK,,,, everyone is here!

Light packs this trip, because we are moving fast. It's finally time to take the curve and see that "unseen view"!

Let's go,,,,, keep close because I'll be talking as we hike,,,, commenting on a number of views others have mentioned. Then we will stop and have a grand look.

---------------

Silver, you ask?

Same old song for a brand new generation, all ready to hear those wore out verses being sung once again. It seems it doesn't make any difference that silver has failed every MODERN human attempt to include it in hard money use and thought. Yes, just like the various failed gold standards, we keep trying to convince people that silver is better than fiat money, even as good as gold. Perhaps, a poor man's gold, no?

Ha! Ha! The last thing a poor man (or woman) needs is silver. Actually, any metal could be a poor man's gold, even iron! One ounce of iron is more affordable than silver and has just as good a chance at outrunning gold,,, percentage wise of course. Isn't that right Randy? I saw your face back there in the group (smile).

The only real argument all the silver pushers have is based on it someday outperforming gold and holding that gain for good,,, again percentage wise. This is the same old worn out logic all the various paper gold substitute players also use. Throw it into the same waste basket with options, futures, leveraged gold contracts, delta hedging both long and short paper positions,,,,, even gold mines, silver mines and the like. All of it is pushed because of the same thought; "why own physical gold when these items will go up faster in the next move"!

Yea,,,, somebody forgot to mention that the next move in gold may be of a nature like "noone" has ever seen before. Oh, you didn't hear that this time the entire paper gold marketplace may crash and burn,,,, taking all those above leverage vehicles down with them? Exposing silver for the play it always truly was,,,,, just another leveraged metal being pushed to poor people standing next to gamblers?? Yea, poor people shouldn't use gold,,,, that's only reserved for rich people hedging their big wealth. Ha! I ever there was a way to increase the gap between have and have nots,,,,, just sell the nots silver while the haves keep gold.

Try this "Thought" on for size:
--- In the beginning, the earth and Western style gold trading was created (smile). All we had were these big 5,000 ounce gold bars moving around. At say, $5 an ounce one of those bars cost $25,000. But one day, as the years went by and use / need pushed it's price ever higher, $100 an ounce became the norm. Oh my, what will we do, who could possibly afford a bar that cost $$1,000,000? I have an idea, said a smart woman (us guys didn't get it), let's melt the bar down into one ounce units and everyone can afford (use) them. Especially now with an ounce being $100. We can call it "poor man's gold money" or "poor man's gold wealth"!

-----Then the price went to $800 an ounce and once again, the poor man couldn't effectively use gold as money. Once again someone had an idea, let's melt the ounces down into 1/10 ounce coins so they will be $80 each. Once again it will be "poor man's money". Boy, we can even build on this logic and add alloys to the gold! Making one gram coins that are the same size and feel as a full ounce. Great day, now gold will always be the "every persons gold";

-----because it can always take the place of paper fiat,,, no matter how much any currency inflation drives up the conversion value of paper money into gold!-----
The point made here is that gold has no set currency price and never has. In fact, we don't even need any more gold produced! All the gold in the world could easily convert all the currency, bank accounts and wealth in existence into gold value,,,,,,, at some currency price. As pointed out above, it will always be available for wealth replacement even if we have to put just one atom of gold in a one ounce coin. Don't laugh, it may happen (big logical smile)!

Further:

All the commodity players, gamblers, mine operators and silver pushers try to sell the public this story; that gold can't rise too high because it's just a industrial use commodity. Therefore, it will never go too high and thus the need for other vehicles to compensate for currency inflation.

Boy, what reasoning about gold's future, resulting in a conclusion that a need exists for leveraged products. But, imagine if gold went up so high no one would buy it and the mines would all go broke???? Ha! This reasoning flies in the face of the fact that gold always eventually rises to match fiat inflation and it doesn't get to such a price because """NOONE""" is buying it!!!!

The proposition is:

-----Hey, nobody is going to buy any jewelry if gold rises too much?---

No wonder so many miners are in such a fix with brain power like that at the helm.

So:
When the next real price inflation begins, silver and every other hard asset will indeed, rise in price. But, for it to become the "poor man's gold" that bridges the wealth gap, silver buyers will have to reconcile a major value rise in gold first. The result of the breakup of paper gold leverage. Only then will gold at the gate of the great inflation race,,, a race that, at best, silver follows gold!

---Gold my friends, not a story of riches to come,,,, real wealth for all modern people today----

The USA may have robbed local and foreign dollar holders of gold in the 30s, but it could not rob the poor of the world of their physical gold ,,,, not then,,,, not tomorrow,, not ever.

As the song goes "ohhh nooooo,,,,, they can't take that away from meee"! (smile)

--------

A drink of water and,,,,,,Onward:

Black Gold?
If I understand the reasoning, some people think there is a mass of physical gold out there and it's being used as underground money. This is what explains the low price of gold today, as all that black market gold surfaces?

Well, that may not be the proposition, but if any of you want to know; none of our evil outlaws are so stupid as to use gold for trading when there is literally "TONNES" of cash circulating around the world. Please, give all of us a "logic break" for a minute? Why would I, as a crook, carry even one ounce of gold when three crisp $100 bills can take it's place? Even ten $100 bills are easier than gold priced at, say $1000. And there is no shortage of that cash stuff around! Hell, I bet there really is more tonnage of "Black Market Cash" in the world than all the gold still in the ground. Cash for ounce,,,,, gold still priced in the thousands! Believe it!

---------

OK, now we are coming to the grand curve. But first a few more comments. I'll rest a bit here and present the rest around 8:00 or 9:00 mountain time (if my time conversions are correct)

Oh NO!

I just closed my laptop, crawled out of the tent and found all these gold trail hikers ready to go? Before I check everyone's park entry tickets (and National park service golden pass cards for people over 60, (smile)) I must see my schedule.
Oh No! I forgot to place an AM after the meeting time in my last hike post. Oh Boy! I'll be back. Let me get some coffee and a pastry. Any French bread shops out here (small grin).

The Curve!

OK,,, I had my coffee and morning walk in the woods to see the wildlife,,,,, packs on,,, let's go.
It's always great to spend time out here,,,, away from the city,,,, out on the Gold Trail.

-----------------------

One more point on Black Gold as we walk:

All that gold, more than triple what we think is out there, would have been in existence for some time prior to our life spans,,,,,, given the timeline required to produce the stuff. Remember, Black Market production could not have existed prior to, say 1971, as even public mines were not making cash profits. Also, it takes real cash and investment to produce both White Gold as well as Black gold.

Indeed, simple extension of physics concludes that nowhere near that much "EXCESS" gold could have been dug over the last 25 years. It didn't happen, even with slave labor. Because, as in above, even lawbreakers have to sell most of the gold in the open just to cover the illegal "Cash" they invested in digging the ore in the first place. These guys don't do such a "wash" business when their cash works just as well in the first place?? Get my point?

Also, the gold would have been moved into the open as the majority of goods and services brought with illegal money, to create their evil lifestyle, must involve the White Market Economy too. Black market wealth is mostly in cash, it's just too easy to move and spend. So, there is no reason to go through gold first, just to buy in the real marketplace.

Further;
With all that gold out there, the Dollar powers would not need to create paper gold debits to placate strong dollar backers. In fact, I suspect they would have created channels to flush all that gold into the market. Illegal or not, this action would have suited their end result.

No, the natural trend of easy money humans, both good and bad would be to spend said gold for other consumable wealth and keep cash in the background. Indeed, this is truly what has been happening as regular investors trade physical for non-physical substitute gold. The small amount of physical supply vs the monstrous paper trading denotes how such existing gold has bridged the industrial use gap. It didn't take a vast new unaccounted supply to make paper seem real, just moving the existing into new hands did the trick. OK, we finished burning that story in the fire.

Let's build another fire.

------------

Mr. Weaver, my god you are all the way out here too?

I did check my trail markers and sure enough, as you said, someone placed a little silver on them,,,, on top of the gold plate that is. It seems that over the last decades of western hard money thought, people have always been trying to ride silver on gold, nothing changes (smile).

That day, when gold first hits $5,000,,,, we will all see something "not as before". You see, price inflation will not be the initial driving factor for gold. No, it will be a realignment of the gold price discovery system. There,,,, in that destruction of paper,,,,, anything with leveraged perception attached will tarnish,,,, silver included (smile). Then,,,, after that value adjustment,,,,, all hard and real assets like gold, silver, real estate, oil, natural gas, soap, etc.,,,,,,,, will be at the starting gate of the great dollar inflation race. The gun will fire and we will all run the trail. In that environment, none of us will "AFFORD" anything of hard value. We will, however trade for what holds value the best,,,, not what gains currency price the fastest or the most-est. Gold, with the greatest history of holding the highest numerical value of world wealth in lieu of assets,,,, will outrun any and all contenders. And do so from a new higher level.

At the flea market, you will, along with others bring boxes of silver and wallets of currency for trade. But, the least discount for real trading value against "real use economic goods" will belong, always, to gold.

Once the trading is done, before walking away from the flea barn, we will square the books by trading any left over silver and currency for ("single atom" if needed) gold coins that have then become the world's secondary saving accounts. Indeed, people will have to accept a discount on silver and or cash to exchange it's excess back to gold. The Free Gold marketplace will do what no government ever could; make gold a savings wealth, not a medium of exchange.

My friend, for a free life, choose gold!

-- Gold, natural wealth, a history of kings, but ess than a holding in these days of our life --

------------------

Why even discuss or buy the Euro?

Someone very smart once E-mailed me that "you must somehow impress upon them that the Euro is but a means to an end, not the end in itself". How very true, even though it sometimes appears that I am a big Euro backer. Or even that I am European! HA! HA! I would not wish such a terrible association on my friends and relatives in EuroLand (smile)

Even so, the day after our Fed lowered rates, the ECB did an equal thing of importance; they stayed still! Our Euro friends are in the drivers seat now.

If you have hiked this trail for a while, it's common that the next gold adventure will transpire with a shift in world currency design first, then affected again from world currency values. Yes, gold will react twice, once against the hyper increase in American domestic economic goods pricing,,,, but before that against the demise of dollar use in most international financial structures.

Most hard money players have expected for some time, that gold will rise in dollars as the dollar falls against other currencies. To date; the dollar has begun to exhibit it's initial fall in exchange rates, but gold has not risen. Don't worry, because it won't rise until a further reduction in dollar "use" has become the trend. Presently, under current international currency structure, the dollar could fall considerably and even ignite slight local price inflation,,,, and gold still would not rise. This goes against the grain of your 70s style money history teachings, correct? I knew so.

You see,,, "this market is not as before". I heard that somewhere years ago? But, it's true. Only a reduction in "dollar use", worldwide, will fracture the current paper gold markets into discount against physical. Then, any further fall in our dollar's exchange value will trigger both major price inflation and a continued huge rise in physical gold prices. But why is it this way?

I'm glad you asked, because we are just rounding the curve. Make room for everyone,watch and listen as I describe this magnificent view! Oh my goodness, it is good!

------------------

Gold, it has no market price!

Some long time ago a group of us came to an understanding that would eventually shake the financial gold world. It seemed that, then, for over twenty years physical gold could be had without the currency markets placing a correct price on it. This made fertile ground for all the special gold dealings that took place over the next decade or so.

Background and foreground for reference:

Lord Keys:
was and is always thought of as the father of modern currency inflation. Whenever prices rose, it was because the treasury was following poor old Keys thoughts on official money policy. But, in truth, we only accepted and acted on half his directives, then proceeded to label our 1/2 use of his stuff as "his socialist process". In truth, he promoted that we expand fiat during times of trouble, then contract during times of less trouble. In the end the world slanted toward a non gold fiat money expansion only and reaped the result.

----Us humans acted on the part that suited our drives while placing the failure of our actions on the whole of Lord Keys's thoughts-------

California Electric:
is a big problem today. But, once again we use only half a process and label it as whole. We created a somewhat fractured deregulation of that state's electric system but called it a full deregulation. Just like Keys above, humans used what part of the process we liked and when it failed, called it a "whole failure" of deregulation.

------ this is the natural way we perceive our social and legal interaction, "and we been doing it a longggg time"------

1970s dollars:
Before the USA took the dollar off of gold, many dollar proponents openly stated that gold would tumble if it had no dollars behind it. Again, the Western mind had conditioned itself to knowing and embracing only half the concept. Again, it seems that we have a way of acknowledging the half of a concept that produces the most liberal response for us while ignoring the half that promotes the most long term good.

We didn't just conveniently forget the truths of what money was, rather we abandoned the knowledge that our dollars were a warehouse receipt for gold. Gold being a real economic good that, for centuries circulated as money, but now ,was suddenly reversed and seen as a receipt for dollars? Something of a major reverse, no?

Indeed, we accepted that dollars were more of a warehouse receipt for "goods exchanged in our economy". Once again we expected everyone to accept "this half" of the process. The half that benefited us the most. Yet, if it failed to work, it was the whole gold process that failed.

----- This, my friends is the legend of gold use in our modern society. Like so much of our flawed thinking, we embrace what is trendy for our personal singular perception while rejecting what is best for the whole.-----

BIS's paper gold:
While extolling all the virtues of gold in an official money system, we ourselves shun the non leverage of physical gold. Indeed, we buy,,, among various gold deeds,,,,, paper gold in the form of BIS shares. Once again we blame the official system because this paper receipt finds it's value defaulted on.

Prior, we proclaim to anyone that will listen that a share receipt of "X" amount of retained gold value is a good deal because we can buy it for 1/2X. X being the the physical gold price. Then, when the humans on the other side of that transaction try to do to us what we were trying to do to them, that is gain the full thrust of gold value we purchased for 1/2 full thrust, and we lose our gain ,,,,,,,, something is wrong with the gold market.

This is but one more fine example of paper gold, like pre 70s dollars, not being able to perform it's perceived function of marching to physical gold's value. Again, as in all above, we as an economic society try to reduce these instruments into non organic concept of receipts that carry no flavor of human function in their distant performance.

----- We brought gold, but if the paper gold market fails to perform to our expectations,,,, then the whole gold market,,,, including physical gold is considered not right for our ownership. We invest in half the process but expect the whole process to work.----------

-----------------------

The Grand view:

Whether we as hard money people knew it or not, our society, governments and yes, even cabals,,,,, all influenced the structure of modern gold markets and did it in a way so that no one could know or trade on the true worth of gold.

Because gold became entwined in modern fiat money function, it suffered all the same effects fiat received from the expansion of banking in our economy. In that arena gold could not help but be paperized and even labeled "the physical gold market".

In truth, anyone understanding this dynamic early on, would see that over time a real currency price for gold would disappear. As we embraced this banking component of the whole gold picture, true to the various examples above, we discarded the need to know what physical gold "alone" would buy. Physical gold was no longer needed as a "receipt for commerce", like our modern dollar. Therefore, it's value in the economy would be degenerated toward our perception of it's commodity value. As long as the banking price, that is the paper price, stayed within this jewelry commodity range, we accepted it as the real price of physical gold.

Indeed, once again, we were destine to experience the gut wrenching results of using half a concept until the whole concept failed. We are at that point today, with gold.

The result of all this was to allow physical gold accumulators (physical gold advocates) to buy gold at an unknown constant discount to it's real wealth value. No matter what the paper trading derivatives would say over the years, any gold delivered through the 90s could be counted on to contain a massive, colossal, value above any past attained paper price.

----Truly, as we talk, there is no known market price for physical gold! A market price for physical gold does not exist!---------

As Another tried to explain and I tried to refine,,,,, gold has historically represented it value as a function of the total world wealth and economic activity. Over time, our known gold supply has grown by leaps and bounds, but our economic structure and goods creation ability has literally exploded a thousand times that gold creation.

In doing so our wealth relationship with gold has seen it's ratio degraded to a tiny fraction of where it would be in a physical only market. Paper gold and the examples above of the human dynamic, have played an incredible roll in creating a mismatch of wealth value unknown in man's time.

I would guess that Michael Kosares, the owner of this gold site, has traded tonnes of gold over his lifetime. Yet, from the time of his start he has never sold gold coins for their physical worth. Truly, he has only sold them for the supply and demand market price of paper gold banking.

Further, as Mr. Paul Eaden's (spelling?) research piece in USAGOLD's opinion site shows, the derivatives market makes the price of gold. Using his view to look over the Gold Trail, we can see that paper dervatives can not reflect the "value" of gold that Another said was comming.

It is from here that we can understand the awesome leverage contained in holding but one ounce of gold. Here, on this ledge overlooking the entire golden valley, we can see this truth! Yet, it is a revelation to gold buyers as much as a curse on gold industry and leveraged paper investors. They spend their days, consuming their wealth, betting on a price that cannot represent gold until it fails. Destroying all they wait for.

From here, we understand why the current prices for gold do not have any bearing on the buying habits of the major players that walk this trail. As Another has said " The price you know, it be your price, not my price".

It is true, we are buying gold, not to trade for a paper value created today. Rather, to hold it beyond the paper destruction that must come tomorrow. Gamblers, traders and gold substitute players will all witness a colossal shift in world wealth that degrades their holdings. Even as their bet on half the process is proven as a folly very typical in human nature. Only unseeable as it exists.

Let's make camp and wake in this new position a while. It will be proven as well worth the hike
(smile).

Fires lit, the stares are out and stories are near:

The price of gold need not be known
it's value cannot be seen
fire in the fields will make truth be shown
in such light it's worth will be redeemed
so on this ledge we make our stand
and no evil will reach this air
real wealth becomes nectar it's taste as cream
by our lips this reason is fair

Good night all, the best days are ahead!

Well. I'm stuck here for a while and updates are still coming through, so:

Paul van Eeden,
Sorry I couldn't place your name correctly when I used it at the Gold Trails. From where I am, I could not access the Gilded Opinion at the time for clarification. Nice thinking, sir.

Randy@ The Tower,
You are right, our dollar and the Yen sure are joined at the hip. Yes, that whole system is going down with us and they will inflate just as much. Can happen no other way. I remember that just a short time ago (or was it a year?) someone here was pushing the Japan market as the place to be. Ha! HA! In short order they beat a hasty retreat from that stance, having sold out first and telling us all after the fact.

No, I'm "on trend" and following Japan down the path and owning bullion and Euros in good proportion to other assets. Everyone here will know when I start allocating out of this mess; that's when West Texas oil fields will start pumping orange juice because $200 oil won't make them any money in our super inflationary environment (smile).

Yes, the HKMA are in line with several other nations as they waver between unloading dollars and keeping them. All the Asians are looking to each other for another reserve, but none of them can afford the impact a regional system would give them. These guys don't trade with each other the way EuroLand does, so they are drifting into Euros kicking and screaming all the way. Once China discloses openly what they are doing privately, all the other Asian Block will run into Euro Zone. China will do the largest tradeing with Europe ever known. Did you see the C1 piece in the WSJ today. Oh yes, "" Europe is the Place to be""!

I want to see where Alan puts all those foreign held treasuries as they come running home. Our bond market is sure to get the shakes, even as the Fed guns the money production. Some change of perception. By the way, that old "super wealthy" fella I mentioned sometime ago,,,,, that he
placed all his 25+ years of gains from big mutual funds,,,,, Yes, he put most of it in physical gold and still thinks the stock markets will go higher. Indeed, his Mutuals, he sold did not take much of a hit. He's right so far in that almost all the US market gains were built on money inflation and he
thinks they will drift even higher as it all unwinds into real price inflation. Only he says gold will boom well past all that once the dollar structure cracks. This is his 80++ year old thinking and doesn't know anything about our reasoning. Small world.

More replies coming.

Cavan Man,

----It's time to consummate the marriage-----

Ha! Ha! I'm not going to tough that one, my friend. But as to "progress"? Well, if you are watching my position you see someone with most of his unneeded cash in Euros drawing interest.

Yes, I still have dollars because I need those darn digital currencies to buy garden seeds and pay the help. Funny, how those fiat system don't go away no matter how worthless they become. Hell, in Brazil they still use the same money. Some people I knew were living there during the 1,000% days. Oh boy, and they still use the stuff. Yes, real life has a habit of proving my point that we are not going back to any gold based currency again. It's just the way we are.

I own physical gold in serious proportion to assets and don't care what the paper price goes to. As long as it's lower, I will buy more over time. Current gold falling in price offers some evidence of pilling on by sellers of paper contracts. But once the gold banking system cracks, I know there will be no physical offered during the next several hundred percent rise. Soooo, I got mine.

I own some gold stocks that I expect to ground to almost zero if the system does not crack first. So far, right on target. Again I'm holding for the profit they will make on the last $1,000 an ounce above massive taxes and production controls. All done after this transition. Yes, controls and taxes will keep the first $9,000 but I make plenty on the last bunch. No, I do not expect them to keep up with bullion.

Time wise, the WA was the first real shot that the BIS, ECB and others were willing to see the demise of our dollar gold block. To date, they are selling it down the drain. Besides all this, I guess nothing much is happening (smile).

=========================
Silvercollector,

---The 'monetary' play of gold Sir becomes more speculative by the day.-----

You are right there. The new EuroLand initiative is phasing out monetary gold in lieu of asset gold. Look closely and you will see this is in essence the entire GoldTrail and the BIS / ECB are on our side.

---The 'commodity' play of gold is good (supply shortfall vs. demand) IF one concedes the fact THAT officaldom will hold or increase gold forever.------

No my friend, the commodity play for gold is dead in the water. The game is how much can the paper gold market expand until it loses all credibility and fails. This sudden shift in our US economy is the result of several factors coming into focus at the same time. Oil, Euro credibility, dollar's
timeline end and our own expansion of gold banking to prolong the dollar. It's all havind an impact on curent gold dealings. As for officialdom holding gold? Again look closely and you will find that none of their gold has been lost, it's just been sold as a currency pairing asset (smile). This is nothing new as it's been going on a long time.

---However, it is a fact that official sector gold has and is decreasing because THEY do not see the monetary role of gold as once was.-----

Absolutely!

---The 'commodity' play of silver presently and I will quote Ted Butler on this one 'Is the best risk/reward in the last 100 years."--------

My friend, today is absolutely the worst time in history to buy yourself into anything labeled a commodity that carries leverage. Because, most every commodity market is swollen in dollar expansion, they will all crack badly when the dollar world fails it's debt. Silver is good, I own some and have said so before. But I also carry $100 dollar bills as assets along with $1.00 bills to spend. In the same light I don't expect those $1.00 bills to ever take the place of or gain on my $100s. Silver is in the same boat, we will trade it but it will not gain the wealth credibility of gold. Further, just as in Brazil, silver will have to compete tomorrow with circulating dollar cash as a currency.
Yes, digital, inflating currency will be everywhere and be used everywhere. In such an environment "I don't need that much silver because I got cash and gold".

Also, I think it was Golden Truth that I last posted to here,,,,,,,,,, some long time ago that I would buy some platinum and Palladium. I did then and still own it. But, it is just an investment, not a wealth savings replacement. It's done well but, in fact, some other investments have done better than these metals.

White Hills

---"Go to the Moon , Alice!!---

Ha! Ha! That's right, my friend!

====================
Knew-bee

Welcome! Yes, own a little of all of it, but as Dirty Harry said "know your limitations". I say understand the difference between diversified world class savings and narrow investment risk.

================

silvercollector,

----On a monetary front there is no currency backed by gold, the endless, circular discussion of such is speculative. --------

No currency should be backed by gold because all such systems fail from human intervention. That is why we are proceeding to an asset based system based on the real fundamentals of a true supply /demand dynamic. All performing in a Free Gold marketplace.

--IF, there is such a monumental storm whereby gold does in fact reach many thousands per once, then dollars would be worth 'dimes'.--------

Absolutely.

----In such an event gold would be confiscated, there IS precedence of this my friend.----

Now that is a "circular discussion". I say, Legal Tender gold held by US residents could be at risk.

------Silver on the other hand, IHMO, would ride on the back of gold (as would all PM's) but would not be confiscated for two reasons; a) sheer bulk------

Yes, that is good logic. It's also the reason investors will not give up using paper currency in exchange for silver. The real precedent here is that governments like Brazil will print whatever denominations are necessary to keep currency use going. We, likewise will save gold and Euros but spend cash. Silver will be on the outside looking in.

-----b) there is no precedent of such.----

Well, there was no precedent for gold taking before they did it,,,,, was there (smile)

------- In speaking with several large silver dealers in the last couple weeks, one oz. silver is non-existant, 5, 10 and 20 onze bars are non-existant and rarely a 50 oz. is available. Most dealers are selling 100oz.and upwards. Is this true of gold lately---------

I bet it's true of steel. That stuff is just flying off the shelves,,,(big grin)! My friend, these silver stories are as old as the hills. Wait 30 years, they will make the rounds again in Europe.

Comment

Cavan Man,

--- What do you mean by "allocating out"? Thanks.-----

Perhaps buy some companies or other assets. But, that will be "in the thick of it" and by no means a total sell out. For most of us, that's me, the coming storm may last most of our remaining days.

ALL: Please don't mis read me. My long running point is to show the nature of things outside our Western View. Every day, around the world, people deal and cope with failing, changing financial life. We all, too, can deal with what is coming as long as we stay open and informed to world
events. Presently, our world is in the grips of a New York broker perception.

It seems to them that everything about wealth can be handled with an option, future or mutual fund allocation. You want to save some Euros as a diversity? Never mind that it's a real functioning currency for a collective nation bigger than ours,,,,,, the NY advice it to buy some Euro options.
You want to back your meager dollar savings with some solid gold, the NY answer is to buy some Bre-X. Or, whatever.

Across this nation, I see a people hardly ready to spiritually and family wise cope with a "real downturn and serious inflation",,,,, and they are leveraged to the end. Yet, trying to use their credit cards to buy some silver mine stock. Oh yes, they owe five times their net worth, but hope that 100 ounces of silver and some $2,000 in a mine will pull them up even with the big boys.

People, that is a crying shame. The advise should be to change your lifestyle "Radically" and get out of debt ASAP. Then save some of our nasty digital currency. Then diversify into things that will never fail to hold value. A poor person, and that is many of the people that are currently being scared enough to think about hard assets, must consider buying the best first and the least last. Paid
up in full as able! Because you can hardly afford to take a chance when the chips turn down.

Sorry, I'm just waiting for time to pass and I'm jumping on a high horse.

Dots

Once again, I find myself waiting for a travel connection. Thank goodness for USAGOLD.

=================
RossL,

Well, my first reply is; As Mr. Fleckenstein often say, "you are not connecting the dots".

I am giving Black Gold the same association as Black Market Gold dealings. This broad name gathers up all gold produced, refined in some reasonable fashion and used in commerce or black barter. It also covers what would have supplied excess, unreported official holdings.

The main points for us to consider when digesting Mr. Guyatt's work is:

Much of the past world gold production both White Market and Black market, prior to say late 60s early 70s, went into paper currencies. That is to say it was sold for industrial use (for paper money), sold to governments for reserves or coinage (for paper money), or refined into worldly recognized and tradable bars (again later sold for paper money). The amount of this pre-71ish gold production that was mined, refined and retained was very small compared to the off record amounts channeled into secret places as described.

The reason this perception is correct in negating our author is that all the gold, Mr. G. speaks of, is in some vault, somewhere,,,, it is not in raw ore form. The process of refining, at that time cost as much as the gold was worth.

Soooo, in order to build these vast stores of gold, not recorded before, would have cost the owners, at the time, more capital to retain it than to sell it for cash and just keep the cash. Further, as our bright Randy points out, during the period that this volume of Black Gold had to be built up, world production could not have come anywhere close to supplying it (dug on the side and out of sight) as any major profitable ore bodies were closely followed by everyone in the business, including governments. Remember, it's only the modern advent of Heap leach and the recent run over $100oz in the 70s that created the ability to mine cheap bodies.

I agree, there is a lot of gold out there in circulation and it is large. But, that gold does exactly what private gold does best; it circulates as is. No one in their right or wrong mind would use that gold to issue derivatives against in the way Mr. G. suggests. Yes, recent bullion owners can and do sell their holdings for cash and the BB then leverage that bullion into x paper. But, that is the same process I have pointed out for some long time now. Such circulating gold has been used to fill the demand gap as it's owners become single derivative holders. But, more to the point, the derivative printing is leveraged 100 times this actual physical inflow by the BBs. If indeed, the supply was balanced, there would be no reason to leverage with paper supply, they would just sell the gold outright and drive the price.

Further,
Yes, the gold may have been stolen and put into storage. But it could not have been in the excess amounts described, beyond worldly knowledge, because of the above production realities at that time. Hell, even small time outlaws, taking and selling thoughts or software require some kind of
infrastructure and collaboration in the open market to succeed. Much less take, store and paperize million of tonnes of gold bullion. Connect the dots.

================

Randy

As yourself and Stranger point out, the money supply rise is breath taking! Again, I say, for the first time in our history we are about to feel the effects of reserve currency competition.

As pointed out further back in the GoldTrail, Allan will not tighten again. To do so will fully concede the dollar. His only avenue in this "new world" of money warfare is to forget the dollar's value and retain it's usage as
much as possible. All done to combat the Euro.

We started down this trail when the Washington Agreement put us "on the road" to high priced gold. The fed will now "manage" a progressive destruction of dollar credibility.
That will entail:

----a loss of credibility of the entire gold market system and corresponding bid down of it's transactions and assets---

----a falling dollar vs the Euro-----

----a falling interest rate environment on par with the recent decade of Japan experience-----

--- the use of our 1980s monetary control act that allows the fed to buy debt from all comer's---

--- a stock market that will not fall as much as we think
(use the old German example here)-----

--- the loss of our ability to shield ourselves from price inflation by buying cheaper foreign goods---

--- the growing loss of trade as China and EuroLand evolve into "the trading block" the world strives to deal with-----

---- real life hyper inflation as this country and generation have never known -----

We are on the road, my friend. It's going to be some ride.

auspec,

Nasal congestion affects most gold estimators to a degree, but it never is as wealth threatening as ear wax can be!

VARIANCE, indeed becomes the question, my friend. If it does exist on the high side then there was no need for derivatives issuance. Negate that proposition and all becomes as you say.

However, with a mild alcohol solution applied within the canal, we may hear the "drum beat" of a massive shortfall of estimated gold existence. Further in the distance comes the sounds of doctored physical stocks, a year or so ago, being tapped for delivery. Only a fall in dollar prices managed to
truncate such demand, yes? Week hands turned away so the strong could continue. Herein, begins the story of leverage paper displacing demand for what does not exist.

Ahhh! Truth is always stranger than fiction. (smile)

Hello all!

Some of my friends (and apparently many readers) often ruminate on why I am so fractured when writing. Often giving the impression of rambling on, not to mention a poor english structure, spelling and grasp. Someone asked, "Your not that way in person, so why such a literary style?" I'll try to
answer what I did strive to explain once some time ago.

My full grasp of english is somewhat poor. But, that's because of a mental structural problem induced by a worldly exposure. With that simple reply, I'll leave it to your best imagination's ability, to decipher (smile).

A better reply, though, would be; it's just my way of following a format introduced by Another. In other words, in his words to me with my (words added) -----

"one should not tell readers (his) exact knowledge, position in life, or what (other's) thoughts should be. Such (talk) extols the self and lessens the reason pursued. (Rather,) let anyone that will listen, think your Thoughts (thru), seldom exposing (them) to (your) fully concluded points. They (people) gain our understanding on (their) own terms, in (their) own way, in (real) events, over time". He
often said; "we are not (here) to prove things, my friend, time will do (that) for us. It (time) will (also) expose (our) standing in world of Thoughts" and "is it not better to stand (in) a crowd and speak softly to (the) nearest ear" and "truth (is) never hidden or (not) exposed, it (is) simply not reasoned by exposure to understanding".

So, (smile)

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

This is the first part of Robert Frost's fabulous classic, as printed above the USAGOLD Walking The Gold Trail page. I'm not sure if it was Randy or MK that choose it, but it was perfect in all the ambiguity such words could convey. For thinking, reasoning people it creates an air of where we
are today. We have rounded "The Curve" of understanding and now must contemplate the trail to follow. Truly, most everyone knows, now, that there are two paths we can go down. Each path denotes following it's own economic block, world currency block and gold price structure block.
Indeed, our future quality of life may depend on how much we understand about these two paths.

Comment
Randy (@ The Tower) (1/17/2001; 11:20:40MT - usagold.com msg#: 45784)Excellent! Here is only a small excerpt from MK's FULL report today -----------

Randy,
Yes, that MK is something! While I cannot get his entire News & Views, what you have provided speaks volumes of a mind endowed with good reasoning. His vision is well positioned to navigate and understand this modern money world around us.

------------

I have this to add:

Who among us, ten or twenty years ago, would have ever thought the fed would still be exploding our dollar production today? Back then, such an "inflation of the currency", over this long a time span, was unthinkable. It would surely lead to an immediate destruction of the dollar. But, here we are, watching as dollar production is gunned for the ????? time.

Everyone with any knowledge at all, the Ruffs, the Browns, the Schultzs, etc.,,,, all knew any such currency inflation, as we see today, would send the world off the dollar standard! Where would we all go for money relief? Why, gold and silver, of course! But, what happened? Well, the world
economic structure changed and those extra years sold time to others for the creation of Another currency.

You see,,,,,,, this was the trick (or ploy) of "one world trade". This concept alone produced the extra demand that needed "trading dollars". This short term transition, aided with cheap oil deals, demanded "digital money" for trade, not savings. It was this new "one worldeconomic expansion
demand" that put our dollar so much more "in play" for it's settlement function. It's value as a savings utility was not in demand, but it's need to denominate and close settlement was. This exceptional surge in trading demand overcame it's loss of demand as a "holder of value".

However, this "digital need" would not alone, negate the run into gold others forsaw. For that sector, our new currency creators needed an overflow valve that would cover this demand. Paper gold! A devise pushed at first by all dollar users.

But what of all the dollar instruments floating around? Cash dollars, near dollar like securities and even Treasury issues? Even they are not the static holdings we knew them as twenty years ago. These paper digits are but commerce receipts and are now a 1000 times more fluid. In fact, few of us can say that we actually have an account that these things are deposited in. Yesterday, instead of real deposits, we owned "deposit credits" and account credits. Bad enough to own them then as it created doubts of redemption. Today, however, we own "deposit credits" of "deposit credits"! In other words, our entire money universe if completely liquid and fluid in nature. We as an American
Western society own no form of a stable currency structure. It is completely a "digital settlement receipt" money.

In this fashion, no form of trade slow down can be allowed. Economic slowdown today, is the death of dollars on a scale never known. Where dollar assets and liabilities, matched on banking books, would once cancel out, creating just a simple alarming deflation,,,,,,,,, today, one dollar loss wipes out hundreds of dollar derivatives assets based and created against that one single deposit credit asset. Even a minor slow down will have the effects of a colossal banking failure. Therefore, the Fed is now in a different universe than the one most economic forecasters are following. It's not a case of changed rules,,,,,, it a case of a completely different environment.

The fed must create an inflation on top of an inflation. To not do so, they will immediately concede the currency world to the "old world's" new currency and it's physical friend. Gold! Even most Euro doubters are beginning to see this new light:

----"Picking a new currency to switch into may seem tricky, but there are only a few sound choices. The euro, a currency nobody ( including us ) had a nice word for in a year, is now one." --
---http://www.gold-eagle.com/gold_digest_01/schultz011901pv.html----

So,
This, my friend, is the new dollar money world we have evolved into. A process that has expended the value and timeline of any and all dollar based assets. As Another said; "your wealth, it not what your dollar say it be". Indeed, what we own is but a shell of a transitional world currency system. Somewhat like owning the common stock of a trading shell company. No assets, but still has a useful bid? It leaves us with little value once it's digital bid, it's "USE FACTOR" moves on and that factor will leave if the world economy slows in the slightest way. In common language, a recession will bring the Western dollar world a modern hyperinflation the likes none of us have ever seen or
read about in our time!

Major players in the gold world have not been blind to this ending dollar timeline. Physical gold is not off their radar screen, just paper substitutes hard money assets not backed by Euro governments! They are not blind to the continued use and need for paper gold to govern the dollars slow demise. Collapse this paper gold world too fast,,,, and the dollar is toast,,,,, too fast!

Indeed, without a Euro to take over the dollars "digital roll" we would be headed for an full blown economic nuclear event. Something oil producers are loath to accept. To this end, the Euro is forced to survive,,,,, warts and all! It will also be physical gold that carries the bulk of past dollar inflation, and the wealth that represents, in the form of gigantic dollar gold price increases. The world's wealth, as denominated in money will not disappear, it will only change hands and form as it supports a new currency system. CB gold is today, traded as an asset, not sold as a liability. Only Western Media reports 1/2 this fact to extend paper gold's decent.

Gold substitutes? Who needs them when their value is based on a failing paper price structure.

Today, who knows the price for physical gold?
It has no market price in our dollar world!

Physical Gold Tomorrow? It will outperform every other asset ---- because it's value as wealth is so misplaced in our time------

As MK so boldly observes;

To FOA. . .A challenging question from the C-Man. . . .

Michael,
Thank you for inviting me up here, on stage. I'll offer some frank discussion to Mr. Cavan Man's challenging question. Only, I hope my oratory doesn't drive the audience from their seats. (smile)
---------

Hello everyone,
I assume you were all given and have reviewed USAGOLD's #45876. Good, then we can get right into it.

C/Man's permanent question is; "Why doesn't Greenspan do something about this? He must see what's coming."!

This crosses all the endless boundaries of political vs human wants and needs. Any answer to such a question exposes our own reality of just how much we all live together and compete together. As I mentioned before; we all are floating down the same river of life,,,,, bickering and debating, living and working,,,, even taking each other into court and war,,,,,, and doing all this as our floats ride the same current of water to it's destine end.

To better understand my replies, let me profile myself a bit. In both the physical and mental image.

The physical:
Am obviously a male and in the second half century of my life.
Have been married only once, to the same wonderful woman for several decades.
I am religious, understand the bible and do physical deeds to convey that knowledge to others.
I strive to live a moral life in every physical sense.
Am in good health and work at treating others as I want them to treat me.

The mental
By some gift of destiny, I know the people world around me. Perhaps better than some?
At all times I am intensely aware of the diversity of human life we all must operate within.
Myself and each of us have our right and wrong codes we live by and these are not always the same.
Yet, and because of this, society as a whole must function thru consensus or make war.
I fully well understand a successful person's (and nation's) feeling that they alone made their way in this world thru hard work and self sacrifice,,,,,, and I admire that pride and courage.
I also well understand that, by far, 99% of these people got where they are at with luck and good fortune,,,,,, more so than their special talents or moral good deeds.
And too, I bridge boundaries of thought, without judgment, in order to promote a common good.


So,
From that "heavy" description, I'll lighten the room a bit with a true short story I find most remarkable for it's human clarity, scope and definition as it applies to all of us (smile):

------I was once at a bar in a very exclusive, very private country club. In this part of the club there were no waiters, only a large team of bartenders that always stayed behind the bar. They would be fired, on the spot if they walked onto the small club floor. By code, this area required members to get their own drinks for ourselves and others. Kind of a step-down from the "big life" so as to bring us back to "regular status". The talk was very friendly and no business discussed.

A new guy, who I'll refer to as "newguy", had just come of age (new money) and wanted his place in the group. I think he was Australian, if my memory is correct. Standing at the bar, within a crowd, he boasted openly about his new boat, 14 meters+/-, and how cheap it was to operate. Conveying a sense of wealth availability. "At this rate I could have several",,,,,,, he said this with a smile and an honest intent. But I (and other older men) knew his motives were as usual for fresh money. After a short chat, he felt like he was fitting in and really making his position felt.

Then, (I'm laughing as I recall this) another much older member strolled up for a drink, just catching the tail end of newguy's talk. Now, you have to understand, this other fella was world class wealthy, but you would never know it. His way was always light and easy. He poked his head into
the group and told newguy,,,,, in a low gravely voice:
---"Boy, you made a good decision on that one! I also down sized to one of those little boats. Saved me a tonne of aggravation. Hell, I now have the rest of my slip rented out to two other members. Good for them for having the space,,,, and good for you for doing the same. You know, the world doesn't need attitudes like we used to have. Good un Mate! (as he walked away)------

Ha! Ha! Ha!,,,,, everyone around newguy kept a straight face as he kept the beer mug at his lips, while looking at us over the top. Then he lowered the glass and said with a straight face,,,,,, ----"He's right, ya know!"----
Ha! Ha! Ha!--- then we all had a great laugh -----------

Ok, where was I?
That story not only tells us who we are in society, but how we react against competition in society. Sometimes the act is extended into a life long play. The above little interaction is carried out in board rooms and on the street,,,,,,, at the CIA and between nation states. No matter if one is rich or poor,,,,,, buying and selling countries or teacups,,,,, operating businesses or pickup trucks,,,,, we all do our part to "puff up" as a defense against the world we perceive is out there. We adapt into
the social and business flow that's at hand. The norm of the occasion,,,,, and the political reality that's in our world around us. Our personal codes of life are often at odds with the consensus of the diverse world we must operate in. Such is life!

You see, in real life, we must often take on the appearance of that world around us. This action isn't lying or cheating so much as it is trying to act out a play that is essential in dealing within our hugely diverse society. A society, by the way, that is mostly made up of people that aren't "the good ones" as we so often perceive ourselves to be.(smile)

This line of comment now lays a foundation that takes me to politics. As I have come to understand the captain at the helm,,,, the driver of the corporation,,,,,, the general at the controls,,,,, they are all just like us. Working outside our personal moral standing standards, they must function using a diverse crew that's usually not of the same thought. Do these leaders lie and cheat if the stress becomes great enough? Of course, how do you think the ,,,, workers of different moralities are jostled to perform,,,, the job gets done and profits get made,,,,,, ! Do these bosses all get caught? No, the ones we extol as "good ones" don't.

Does the democrat tax and spend? No more than the republican borrows and spends! Is your group's moral or business objectives correct for the country? Only if they apply to the whole diverse society. Otherwise, you are imposing a will upon others.

Now, with that overview in mind:
Is Alan Greenspan doing everything he can to oversee a fiat banking system while functioning within our political society? I can answer that with .9999% certainty. Yes! In fact, throw a few extra 999s on that answer (smile).

You see, a nations rules, laws and moral requirements are never more than a consensus vote from changing. In such an environment, no leader can function for long at his own or our own standards. The office, itself is a reflection of power groups pushing their own position and that requires us to make our personal codes just that, personal codes. Not public codes.

Any person of clear vision could stand upon the highest mountain, look 360, and see that this country is not the same body it started from. Our codes of conduct, perceptions of right vs wrong and even our attitudes of wealth have all been diluted from other sources. This is not to say it's
good or bad, as this dilution often comes from foreign political perceptions that preceded our nation' history. In some ways, it predates many generations. Right or wrong, good or bad, some of these accepted political directions have been used a long time.

Mr. G. is not trying to make us something we as a group are not. He cannot. His objective is to support, prolong and protect our financial system as it must operate in it's present evolution. Make no mistake, he and every leader in his position understands that fiat money systems are always in evolution. There is not and never has been a status quo when it comes to a nation's money. Recent history is ripe with such change, even during the usage of gold within the currency stable.

I can assure all of you that our fed chief does not confuse a strong vs week dollar with a stable fiat money system. This current strong vs week dynamic, happening over the span of 20+/- years is little more than wafting from bank to bank as we ride the river that is our currencies timeline. Our
dollar is evolving even as our society evolves. It's use as a world reserve and even as a medium of exchange was never written in some code of world conduct or acceptance. Circumstance and consensus will change any currencies worth regardless of who manages it's trip through time and space.

So, there you have C-Man. I wish you had asked earlier? Because; "I didn't know there was a problem." (smile)

To FOA. . .A challenging question from the C-Man. . . .
FOA: "The fed must create an inflation on top of an inflation. To not do so, they will immediately concede the currency world to the 'old world's' new currency and it's physical friend. Gold! Even most Euro doubters are beginning to see this new light. . ."

Including me. I saw in the Economist the other day that Goldman Sachs is calling for a euro price this year of $1.22! Bold and telling. . . This is a currency price based on "an inflation on top of an inflation". . . .Yes?

Cavan Man called today. And as is frequently the case the conversation got around to you and Another, the economy, currency values, etc. It is always good to hear from this fellow knight and traveller, and in the midst of the conversation he asked, as I have come to learn is his customary fashion: "Why doesn't Greenspan do something about this. He must see what's coming." I tried to answer that question, but I wonder how you would respond. Here (Greenspan) is a man who spent his middle years as one of us. Then he became Fed chairman charged with the responsibilities of lender of last resort and something changed. . .Or did it? I answered the question as best I could but it is one that does not lend itself to an easy answer. And perhaps only Alan Greenspan himself could answer it to real satisfaction. I venture a guess that he might respond smiling slyly with "I didn't know there was a problem." (Thought of that after I hung up the phone, Cavan Man.)

FOA, I wonder if you, or perhaps Another, have any thoughts on this. I think the question might open the door to some interesting discussion. If anyone else would like to take a stab at it, I think we might all gain by your thoughts. And I hope I am not usurping prime posting privileges, C-Man. It is a good question and I didn't want to take the chance that you might pass on a great Forum opportunity. (I hope you don't mind.) Now you've stimulated us all.

P.S.(and an aside) An editorialist asked this morning: "What do you get when you cross the Chairman of the Fed and the Godfather." Answer: An offer you can't understand.

Trail Guide Question
We export more than our currency from US shores. What of those in the "East" that have perspective not unlike those in the "West". I believe there might be many of these; yes?

Cavan Man,
We export many goods & services, true. But, over time our competition is making these exports less inviting. Even now, at current exchange rates, much of what we sell can be purchased somewhere else at close to the same value. Remember, at some point, as our dollar drops in value,
domestic inflation raises local production costs enough that it cancels our much of any perceived "falling dollar advantage" in world trade.

The coming dollar fallaway will not induce any such export boom that many foresee. It will not be a saving grace for our economy. You see, in the past, such a drop in the reserve currency had the same inflationary effects on all world producing economic structures. This time, however, a
transition into Euro use for reserve and trade settlement will blanket such rising cost effects, somewhat protecting any national trading block that opts out of the dollar receive structure. The obvious advantage will become easy for everyone to see.

Even "nonwestern" players, that operate within the Western zone of thought, are not permanent in their trade position. They will shift as everyone else does. It's just a matter of time and evolution.(smile)

Before I go deep into this, I would like to hear how others would walk in Mr. G's shoes. I also have a Black Gold comment for ORO just as soon as we pass this area. I'll be back in a day or so.

Hello Randy,
I'm working on a long discussion between us. At my place just above the trail head. Over wine, we will travel all the way back to around 610 BC, in the area of Lidia. This will be an easy read that lays out a broad position about gold. Who knows, we may even run thru a timeline and into a fella
our other posters have mentioned, Homer? (smile) Indeed, maybe the perceptions of gold by the ancients will prove to be the best position for anyone to be in, considering the nature of what is coming.

ALL,
Well, some paper gold bugs can't understand how a failing paper pricing system for gold can hurt their mine investments. Looks like this is only the beginning. How many HMs, MENs, HLs are next? Great days for physical gold advocates,,,,,,, awful days for players of gold substitutes, no?

Physical Gold,,,,,,, nothing else can compare!

-------------------

" " Placer Dome sees no hope of higher gold price, plans massive asset write downs " "

------TORONTO (CP) -- Seeing no prospect of a significant rise in the price of gold, Placer Dome Inc. (PDG:TSE) is reducing the accounting value of its gold reserves to $300 US an ounce from $325. The world's fifth-largest gold miner also cut its estimate of its proved and probable gold reserves by almost 30 per cent.-----------

------- In light of the reduced gold-price assumption, Placer Dome's proven and probable reserves decreased to 47 million ounces as of Dec. 31, down from 65.9 million ounces that were considered economically recoverable at the end of 1999.--------------

-----------The company said the volume of reserves would be cut by a further five per cent if the long-term price of gold fell to $275 US an ounce------------

------------In the meantime, "we are relentlessly pursuing cost-reduction initiatives and other measures in response to the business environment."---------------

A Comment, then The Gold Of Troy
Hello Randy!
I thought this would be a good time to take a break from the trail. Here, at my place on the Trail Head, we can consume the luxury of a more relaxed, liberal conversation. Some day, I hope Michael, yourself or others may physically join (actual posting) in talks. I know MK is very busy (talking to friends / clients and counting his / their gold (smile)) so his being here, in spirit only, is enough for today.

For you, Randy, I'm afraid that the times ahead may make yourself one of only a few that will talk to me. You see, attitudes in this gold market are going to become very hard, almost stone like. Some of this will be reflected in a widening "valley between paper gold owners and physical gold owners",,,,, that is a subjuec I have, in the past, referred to. Unless one has the reasoning powers to see the future in physical gold, as I know you do, the possibilities of overcoming and / or regaining ongoing and future losses of wealth will congeal many a person's feelings . So, for now, engage your free spirit and have a glass of my best wine. I hope you enjoy this red, there were only 500 cases of it made in the whole world and I got the last one (smile). All the best, my friend.

---------------

(after a sip and a moment to reflect)

You know, in a little bit, in the next post, I'm going into a whole discussion about ancient gold,,,,,, carrying the thought right to the present. But before doing that:

I think it's a real shame, the way our Western / American investment culture has changed the private persons perceptions of gold,,,,, indeed, a change in their perceptions of all wealth. It seems that almost every form of asset holding must be in some form of leveraged and / or non real ownership. Paper this,,,,,, paper that,,,,, ten to one gains,,,,odds are on your side,,,, and so on and so on. And, the problem is not just gold,,,, it's visible in everything.

I guess this is what happens when decades of currency inflation leads to almost free money flow for any imaginable use,,,, and that unlimited ability to borrow and spend comes on top of little or no price inflation! The dollar's reserve function and the lack of significant price rises such a world financial structure creates,,,,,, has developed a frozen value perception in our currency's image. A frozen value image that our society absolutely knows is their net worth's purchasing power for real things. Collectively, it isn't and never has been.

We have a whole generation,,,, even several generations,,, perhaps, yourself included,,,,, that do not perceive their standings as being high up upon the hill. Many, if not most, of the voting public see their economic location at the bottom or only partially up said economic mountain,,,,, and they see that any fallback in the economy will drive them into negative territory. In reality, we are, and have been on easy street. With such a conflict, is it any wonder that Alan Greenspan must inflate further? No different from the past,,,,,, but still inflate, regardless of the world's new currency environment? In addition, following such a public political directive, our fed's inflation can casually respond to the changed nature of our derivative economy and not seem out of place while doing it.

With this almost national perception of a false "net worth purchasing power" and with our ability to borrow more into said net worth, our perception's impact,,,,,,, as a whole,,, on society's money culture cannot be resisted. Yet, all this proceeds as our fiat values, in reality, are transitory and always have been. It's just not understood as a natural process. We see it in all our conversations, at home, at work, at play and on the internet. With such a well grounded belief:
----People are reduced to playing a game with their wealth, instead of employing it to create a better standard of life. A better standard based more upon the security of ownership, now, than upon some quantity of purchasing power who's future value conversion is unknown.------
----------------

(another pause and a sip)

You know -------- some readers think I'm being disingenuous when I write,(and I am using that word with Samuel Johnson's 1755 definition) but it takes that much and more to impact the diverse minds that come here. When saying diverse, I mean intentions as well as educational and cultural backgrounds.

I know there are "real asset" people, like yourself, here. Physical gold advocates that are, in no rime or reason, gloom and doom gold bugs. Like you, Randy, they applied their mental faculties using a lot of hard work and grew to understand the real world and where it's going. Not just following the Western investment crowd.

But, we also engage no less than a small hoard of "western style" paper gold bugs on this venue,,, as over the years they have become and represent the majority of hard money thought regarding gold. Using the thoughts and perceptions I just outlined earlier (above),,,,,, these people,,,,,, mostly Americans and foreign natives using American trends as a guide,,,,,,, are employing their assets into this hard money arena,,,,, and doing it using historic realities, not future realities. That's fine if we relive the past! However, today, the evolution of our currencies lifeline trend has deformed these investment methods into little more than gambling. And it's the exact same gambling dynamic they vocally deplore and are trying to escape from in other areas. In case any readers are drifting off, here, I'm directly referring to paper hard money investments in today's world. Not only are these perceived hard money vehicles "not the same as before",,,,,,,,,,, like the currency, too ,,,,, their station in life is moving on. Out away from what their past precidents.

(another pause)

When gold is discussed on public forums and at investment conferences, many true physical gold advocated don't perceive the motivation behind the oratory from today's paper gold bugs. Their interest in physical gold is real, but their actual intent is to gain "a" security by profiting from a gold dynamic created by other's buying actions. Never to gain "the" actual security by entering into the gold dynamic themselves. Many of them don't have a clue of what all that means. Yet, such an understanding would delinenate the huge difference within this concept. Especially today,,,,, and in the future as said difference may make or break the financial worth of many. Here is an example of such thinking:
----- Two guys are talking about shoes:
"Hey, did you notice how few people have shoes today? I know we have them and their use is obvious. It balances our overall physical appearance and gives a long-lasting foundation for our feet and for our human structure. In turn, shoes support all the other investment clothes we own and use during our life."

While these fellas are talking several other "Americans" overhear the conversation and join in:
"Shoes,,,,, shoes,,,, what's this about shoes? You say there is a demand for them,,,, a deficit in supply? Oh yes, we completely understand the concept and fully embrace it. Without shoes, none of us could economically stand up straight. The whole world is woefully shy of them and will someday be forced,,,,, if not by foresight, by need, to own them. There is no way any of us could transverse a hard rocky economic road without gold,,,, weeeee mean shoes! Man alive,,,,, I'm going to buy a shoe factory and make some money from all this new demand."

But, the first two guys observed and asked:
"But, wait a minute,,,,,, aren't you going to follow your own keen concept and buy some shoes for yourself and your family first? You know, that public shoe company does not and will not,,,, by government tax laws and regulations,,,,,, sell it's product directly to it's owners. They can only give paper profits to their owners. During all the big rush, you will be in with all the other "shoeless buyers"

Oh yeah,,,,,, we will later buy them,,, said the traders,,,,, besides, I got a 1/4 shoe now,,,, that's a start. And, by holding these tiny shoe laces, we can stand here and fit in with all you well heeled players (grinning like Texas Westerner on an oil well ). Look, I'm in this to make money,,,,, it's just a concept like all the others I follow. I do the same thing when I'm with other "conceptors" of the same ilk,,,,,, I talk their talk to understand their concept. But, I really don't need your gold as long as I got my paper profits.

OK, said the two guys with shoes. We don't mind your talking with us, so long as your perceptions don't distort our end purpose of having good shoes,,,,,,, and just don't complain when your company's value can't equal the worth of good shoes on the hard road before us.
------------------

Further to consider,
I think many players degrade our reasoning because it just suites their confrontational nature. Their constant replay of the same past failed positions clouds the view, even as it does make everyone think harder. Some may have to drop more wealth before they learn, I don't know? In addition, some paper players, caught up in the paper game our currency inflation creates, mentally cannot let go. To do so places them outside their social strata even if it saves them much heart ache and money. They feel that only the leverage is in the leverage of some gold substitute, never gold itself as the means to an end. Own silver, mine stocks, erivatives, etc.,,,,,, and that position will restore their already considerable loses, they hope.

It's a: "there just has to be a way I can play this game using some paper system",,,,,," even another more leveraged metal if need be". I, myself, know the feeling and over a lifetime have evolved through it. Problem is I doubt others will have that same luxury of so much time.

So, Randy, let's go back in time and space to build a gold perception the physical gold advocates have understood from the beginning.

I'll post in a few hours (if the power stays on at the Trail Head) (smile)

The Gold Of Troy!

Hello again Randy,
Let me read something to you that will set the tone of this ongoing discussion:
---- Was There a Real Trojan War? ----

Until the 19th century it was widely believed that Troy and the Trojan war were imaginary. Then, in 1871, an American named Heinrich Schliemann began excavating an ancient city in Turkey. To the amazement of many, this retired businessman had discovered the lost city of Troy.

Nine cities have been found at the site, one on top of the other. The seventh city was destroyed around 1250 BC and appears to be the Troy of legend. You can still see the ruins of its towers and its walls, which were sixteen feet thick.

Schliemann identified Troy's location through clues he found in the Iliad, the epic attributed to the Greek poet Homer. Little is known about Homer except that he was blind. In ancient times it was believed that he had lived during the Trojan War, but most modern scholars think that he lived in the 8th or 9th century B.C. His poems weren't written down when they were first composed, but were transmitted orally for many years. Some people suspect that the poems were actually the work of successive generations of poets, and that Homer didn't exist. Of course, the same thing was once said about Troy.

All thanks to the work of Heinrich Schilemann. Without him we might still regard the Trojan War as nothing more than myth. What started the Trojan War? It has been suggested that the Greeks may have been fighting to gain control of the Dardanelles, a water passage between the Mediterranean and Black seas, near Troy. Or perhaps the war truly was fought over a woman named Helen. The truth is lost in the past.---------------------------------
Well, Randy, that Mr. Schilemann (1822 - 1890) was quite an explorer. His work helped uncover a mountain of knowledge about ancient life. Not to mention it helped us conceive how these people viewed their "wealth of Ages". Thank goodness for California gold. too! Yes, I said that right, as that is what financed his work if you can believe it?. Here is more, then I'll begin:

------
Heinrich Schliemann was a bold dreamer and a prolific liar. Despite those credentials, it wasn't politics that brought him to Gold Rush Sacramento in 1851. Instead, it was the death of his brother Ludwig, from typhus. Schliemann, a German-born merchant had been living in St. Petersburg, Russia.

He planned to make sure his brother was properly buried, claim what he believed to be a sizable estate, and get back to Europe. What he found, however, was that his brother had been buried without a tombstone, and his brother's business partner had made off with the loot. So Schliemann paid $50 for a marble headstone, and set himself up in business as a gold broker. In addition to making up outrageous stories in his diary, Schliemann was more than a little paranoid. Afraid of fire, his office was located in Sacramento's only brick-and-stone building, at Front and J streets. He wrote that he often slept on top of the gold, with pistols across his chest.

Despite two bouts of yellow fever, Schliemann persevered, and in nine months he made more than $400,000, some of it legitimately. He returned to St. Petersburg in1852, using his Gold Rush fortune to make an even greater fortune in the Crimean War. And his money allowed Schliemann to indulge his real passion in rchaeology -- and preserve himself a place in history.

In 1871, Schliemann, using Homer's "Iliad" as a guide, began digging in what is now Turkey, and found the lost city of Troy. A German merchant with a penchant for prevarication spurred the growth of modern archaeology and found the gold of an ancient era -- using the gold of California.
-------------------------------------

Oh boy, what a life, what a story?

Yes, on that small mound, about 5 miles from the coast, they found layer after layer of ancient cities. One of them was indeed, Troy. The treasures were many and quite a few made of gold. Hair - rings and small fluted beakers, vessel covers and sauceboats, even a spectacular large diadem (head dress) with pendants. These treasures are, in fact housed in some 50 museums around the world. Later, around our time (1994) it's been certified that a lower level of excavations did, indeed belong in the Bronze age, 2600 - 2300 BC. This places these golden remains around the same periods and datebacks as in the Thebes works.

-------The studies in Egypt.

One current project called The Theban Mapping Project, is giving us a better and better idea of how life was during these early civilizations, and this is but one of several "modern" evaluation of ancient life.

In that area of the world, researchers are probing a lot of ancient lifestyles. From around 3000 BC, through the Old Kingdom (2700 - 2100 BC), during the Middle Kingdom (1700 - 1200 BC), passing the New Kingdom (1500 - 1000), into the Graeco - Roman Period (300BC to 400 AD),,, this is truly some record of life. It, along with many others, uncovers and exposes so much history it's astounding.

----------------

Our reasons for following these old lifestyles is, for us of course, to gain a better perception of how humans understood and used their wealth, back then. What is coming to light, for for gold advocates, is an ongoing evaluation of how we, as a modern people, have lost so much of our connection and understanding to what wealth is, how much it's worth and how to use it. This is, of course, in contrast to the ways wealth, including gold was seen and valued then.

---------------

Concerning "gold as money", One of the first things we established about the Troy collection was that there were very few, if any coins found. At least allowing for the size of the find. Nine + levels were dug, representing a hugh section of antiquity and no coins remained with the find. Here was a mass of civilization leaving treasure after treasure of fantastic gold artwork, yet, no coins to speak of. We cannot conclude that the coins were taken and melted down, because the art was just as valuable, yet it didn't get taken. And these treasures were laid down in several cities and generations, over time.

Researching further, many of the other great finds from the BC and early AD period were from tombs and lesser burial sights. Places where people of "excessive worth" took their excesses with them. But regular cities with regular people had relatively few coins. So what is the point? Let's go further.

----------

Some of the earliest coins were stamped with a detailed press, struck with a blow that indented the heated metal. The Alyattes from Lydia (610-561 BC) was one of the earliest. It and a whole host of later coins were marked this way. We know that some of the most rare were natural forming in stream beds, because they were electrum (natural combination of gold and silver). They would not have been man made that way, at that time. Mostly because the silver gold combinations, in natural forming metal, were never equal in amounts. Giving the coins different values. Were they this particular about content and weight? You bet. The first coins were called staters, meaning "weighters" and were used as the norm for weights in other coins.

So, with the Athens, Macedon, Tarentum and Antiochus to name a few, began the worlds first coins. Gold coins? Yes they were, but money as we know it? Our view of how these people viewed and used this gold money is, we believe, far different from what gold scholars teach. And it's impact on estimates of existing modern gold supply and use is enormous.

-----------------

Randy,
walk up to any citizen living during 335BC, in the latest town where Troy once was, show them a "Head of Zeus" (Saracuse 3 stater) coin. Then show him a vessel of oil and ask which he would take in equal trade for anything? Odd are, even though your two items were of equal value, he would take the vessel. Why?


All throughout these early times, prior to BC and into some AD, people didn't see these gold coins as we think of money today. These various gold coins had tremendous value, but they were just gold pieces. They were wealth for trade like everything else was.. That's simple logic, I know, but the vessel of oil, for instance was just as tradable as a gold coin. In fact, within most of the medium sizes city states of that era, barter of like goods was just as good or better than gold coin. One's life was better if he owned wealth he used.

Humans of that period didn't live all that long a time span. Even though some accounts prove otherwise, the majority of life went by rather quickly. If you were a regular part of society in general, your wealth was what you had and consumed during those short days. There were no banks or investment houses and the average person's return on a wealth unit was his length of use and it's quality of life enhancement. More to the point, this logic made these guys spenders of gold, rather than savers! If you had gained gold in trade, for your services or goods supplied, you had no reason to save it. There was no other money that needed to be hedged against value loss.

It's becoming more and more apparent that average people of that time quickly traded (spent) their gold for something useful of value, for both them and their family. They didn't have the excess we know today. In modern nomenclature; this logic dictates that a much smaller amount of gold money circulated and circulated faster than many supposed. All forms of jewlery and art objects were in the same situation.

For longer savings, even for those of above average means that had all they wanted, people tended to spend their most valuable gold coins first, while saving the least valuable (bronze, silver, iron) for emergencies and later use. To us, today this sounds strange, but place yourself in that time. It was better to build your most useful and needed store of things while times were good.

Therefore, you traded the gold, which brought the most equal trade, first. If things got so bad that one had to dig up the stash, you were trading for last ditch things anyway. Kind of like wrapping up and burying beef jerky to get you thru a pinch. This use of lower metal is suported. Remember, lots of things served as money objects them. Even much later, AD, it was common in Roam to trad big iron bricks that were forged as a bull. It's use was in trade for "one bull" or something of that animal's value.

This tends to explain why so many hordes of lesser quality, non gold coins are always being found today. Roman silver, bronze, iron, copper coins are very common. The classic belief is that all the gold was found, melted down and recast. But that action just didn't fit the whole profile of life's need back then. The majority of gold in average and even upper hands was always on the move, in trade or payment for service. Each succession of ruler, simply reused the old coins or melted them down and restruck with a new image. And new gold was minted only if it was easy to find. Especially stolen jewlery. Mined gold was a very last resort.

Remember, real useful goods crowded a rich ruler's house, too and these were just as valuable and tradable as gold. Besides, far too many finds have come up with jewelry and no coins to suggest some robbery by thieves sold the coins to new rulers with melting pots. The gold would have been taken whether coin or art.

Taxes were paid in goods, service or coin (preferably gold) and regular people knew it. Far better to trade your gold and save your wealth in a bulky form so the tax man's take at least has a chance of taking less than enough. To store your wealth in gold and risk him finding and taking it all was just not acceptable.

The great gold stores we have found almost always point to their being the reserves of a rich ruling class. Just like modern billionaires, after too much comes excess and gold was the only alternative for someone with guards and regular army.

On the Road

More and more evidence is mounting that the largest portion of gold, during this early period was, "On The Road"! The perception that every person had some portion of gold as savings is blunted by their lack of need for such wealth. Gold was needed and used to spend "On The Road" more so than in local domains. Whether for armies or traveling merchants, gold moved more than it was saved. Even gold in the form of art was "fair game" for the regular people to use as a tradable medium. In fact it was just as likely used as money "on The Road" as coins. This further explains the findings of small amounts of jewelry in most of the locations where small towns were located. In the reasoning of Troy, the lack of coinage supports the movement of gold more than the saving of it.

We find gold more in the "upper status" burial places of great cities than in the areas where common man traded, lived and kept his personal worth. We further conclude that gold was much harder to find and utilize, back then than many supposed. Yes, great amounts were around, but the reality was that these amounts were perhaps 1/2 or less than many others conclude. Simply because finding or producing gold meant displacing labor that could be making barter able goods of equal value. Besides, gold that was in trade, was valuable enough that what existed mostly covered it's need in long distance commerce. This further points to a much greater value for a much lesser amount of gold while it was used during this period.

When evaluating lifestyle wealth, back them, many often find themselves comparing things in a relative mode with today's perspective. In this position we think the mark has been far missed for gold worth. It's possible that gold payment, in these early times amounted to a hugh premium compared to today. The various goods and lifestyle conditions in existence, indicate a much higher relative worth for their goods of daily life. Thereby giving gold a much greater relative worth within one's life also. If a one stater Darius of gold, from Cyrus of Persia was worth a very valuable vessel of oil, why utilize the effort to find gold just to trade for some oil. Better to skip the gold production and make the oil. This was the norm for thinking by people not trading on the road, living "within local" city states. Indeed, outside the need to pay armies, a much smaller amount of gold did the job much better than us modern thinkers thought was necessary. Further, the use of oversea warefare and trade perhaps lost more gold into the ocean than we will ever know.

Consider these possibilities well. In that gold today is in a much lesser existence, compared to modern goods supply and lifestyle enhancements, when comparing it to it's value in life in the past. It's true worth as a wealth medium could be a 1,000 times higher! For it to return to it's ancient position of true asset wealth, for trade outside the modern currency relm, we can see where it's European benefactors have once again placed it "On The Road" to much higher fiat currency prices.

Next: Gold from the Roman era forward.

Thanks Randy and ALL

Comment

Michael,

In response to your CavanMan question about Greenspan; I made my reply a deep and philosophical ramble, hoping to draw out some other's concepts and opinions about him. For some reason (smile), I feel I know the man and his reasoning, in depth, and wanted to see just what others would do in his shoes. A few replied and I will later, in kind. Perhaps, to our good poster PHinLA's writings, yesterday. Hope his power is still on (grin)!

As to your / our little bet (smile),,,,, I can dump a few K trying to make a point about physical gold vs futures, but dropping a US$ to Mr. Kosares over England would mentally and politically break me,,, Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha!,,,,,, Actually, I don't feel that you are a gambler, but business men of your stature must take public risks on occasions, no?,,,, So, on that account, I will not feel good about taking your money (grin). Besides, being so positive of my new gained one US dollar of wealth from USAGOLD, I already converted it into Euros and invested it (huge grin!) Ha! Ha! Time will tell, my friend!

To comment on your post earlier:

Adrian van Eck doesn't miss a thing and is usually right in the middle of every political motivation that's flowing at the moment. My observations are that this is but another example of the fluid political events we follow and do concur that the methods indicate open economic trade warfare
behind the screens. Indeed, yourself, myself and anyone following the flow of comments here at USAGOLD are attempting to measure the impact of these moves upon our respective currency / economic zones. Even as these nation states combat each other, behind the doors for an upper
hand.

Boy, I have a hard time replying any better than our Mr.CavanMan did in his (01/26/01; 19:07:51MT - usagold.com msg#: 46590) and everyone should read it again. You have been holding back on us sir (smile).

His point to you, Michael, is that of history and the ebb and flow of greatness in nation states: ---

--"The UK trade flows to the East naturally. As usual, your thought is excellent. However, the British being primarily a conservative people will not make a (quantum) leap of faith across the pond I do believe. Rather, they will be a key member of the EC over the long haul."---

So, I can only support his complete post with my comments followed with several copies from Dravos.

My Coment to a few others:
Codoleeza Rice, G.W. Bush's foreign policy advisor, is only doing her job. But, her proposition alone does not negate the obvious; the US in coming off an economic peak inspired by a huge Fed engineered currency inflation. And, because this dynamic is happening at a point and time unique in
history, world reserve currency trends will now control how the US handles this particular liquification of it's system. This simple point is painfully in plain view throughout the Euro Zone block. It's on record within so many ECB, French, BIS and multi EuroLand publications we cannot begin to repeat it all. They (EuroLand) saw our expansion for what it was, knew it's reason for building, noted that our dollar was driven to "overvaluation" by political means, and knew the Euro "under valuation" was but a passing thing. The British were not yesterday, and are not today blinded to this fact. They, as have other dollar trading blocks, completely based their financial structure upon an endless extension of the world's present reserve currency structure. Yet, today, for the first time in modern US history, there is a real risk that that reserve structure may fracture,
taking those financial houses into a hyperinflation with us.

Bringing Britain into NAFTA would be a great accomplishment and is as good as any a political and economic point for the new Bush people to aspire for,,,,, but points are for arguing while reality is the game that wins votes. Do we really think England will dive for this even as Mexico reveals the danger. From Dravos:

Mexico Will Seek New EU Trade Links

Fox Wants to Offset Potential Harm to Growth From U.S.Slowdown

DAVOS, Switzerland President Vicente Fox of Mexico said Thursday that the U.S. economic slowdown could damage his country's growth target this year, but he said he would work to replace lost U.S. trade and investment by forging new commercial ties with the European Union.

"The slowdown in the United States could affect our projection of 4.5 percent growth in 2001, but we want to substitute it with more European trade and investment and make use of the recently signed trade agreement between Mexico and the European Union," Mr. Fox said Thursday night in an interview in Davos with the International Herald Tribune.

Mr. Fox said he would soon visit France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Switzerland to promote Mexican exports and to seek fresh European investment in Mexico.----------------
-------------

HA! HA! Well, Michael, CMan, what do you think of my rambeling on? Can't you just see Britain wondering why they are coming in the front door while Mexico is running out the back? Oh Boy!,,,,Here comes Fox, a smart cookie I might add, signing trade expanding pacts with EuroLand because he can't make his numbers with the US. So what is England going to trade to us that could undercut Mexico? Makes you think, right? (smile)

Also,,,,, Why in the world would Britain want to joint up with this bunch, at a period where they are all driving each others profit margin down the drain, just to recessitate a plunging economic and financial structure built on dollars? And,,,, If anyone doesn't think that Japan does not stand head and shoulders within our little NAFTA organization, they better get new a new financial planner because their own thinking is way off. Their Yen economy is back boned into the USA and it's dollar. More from Dravos:

Japan Fights to Counter Gloom Over Its Economy
Alan Friedman and David Ignatius International Herald Tribune
Saturday, January 27, 2001

DAVOS, Switzerland Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan will use an appearance here on Saturday to try to counteract the extreme gloom about prospects for the world's second largest economy that has emerged at the annual economic conclave here.

Mr. Mori's appearance at the World Economic Forum, the first ever by a Japanese prime minister, comes as bankers, business executives and economists are wondering aloud if Japan is in recession. Fears are mounting that, after a decade of anemic growth, the country's political paralysis, high debt and snail's pace approach to deregulation and reform could combine with the U.S. economic slowdown to damage global growth prospects this year.

According to a senior Japanese official familiar with Mr. Mori's speech, the prime minister will offer both hope for the future and a frank, even humble assessment of what the official termed "the lost decade."--------------------

Greenspan Backs Big Tax Cuts, A Political Boost for Bush Plan

NEW YORK The U.S. economy has virtually stopped growing, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress on Thursday, a surprisingly gloomy view that increases the prospects for a deep interest-rate cut next week.----------------------------------


So, Michael,,,,, the fifty-first state? I don't think so. If they do it will be like buying all kinds of leveraged gold substitutes several years ago when some thinkers where saying stick with the real thing instead (smile). By god, that would have been the type of political advisor the Queen needs today!

Britain, like Physical Gold Advocates today, may show some ware from linking to the huge economy of the new Europe, but those minor scares will be nothing compared to the loss (like gold paper players) of going deeper in dollar leverage or staying at all within the US financial and economic trading block. Just at the time in history when we must super inflate away our debts.

------------
Further to your post, Michael: They cannot keep the pound as it stands. It's almost a dollar derivative now. In fact, I know they are monitoring the Gulf Cooperation Council, looking for pointers on how they will structure a parallel currency that uses Euros for settlement, all prior to
joining. Besides, they (HM Treasury) have already shown their hand to us by clearing out as much of their favored Bullion Bank gold debts as possible before EMU.

As to their becoming a halfway house, bridging trade between a future inflating NAFTA arena and EuroLand? Great idea, but Mexico is already showing that won't work. They and everyone else will undercut Britain long before they can "rule the waves again" (smile).

You are a good historian, my friend, and any assessment of world power flows requires just such an input if one is to understand these modern moves. But this time the real history is before us and we will be a big part of it! Oh yes,,,,,,,,, we will!

Now, I'm going to take my little boat and go fishing. Mans got to eat, you know. Be back later, after a fish dinner! (smile)

(No Subject)

I have several unfinished discussions I wanted to some day return to. The Traveler series was a good one. The aspect of Black Gold was another. Then we could breakdown Mr. Greenspan's thoughts. All in good time. Recently, I began what would be quite a side journey at the GoldTrail Page. Just now I see a need to explain the entire timeline of events that lead to our offering "Another's Thoughts". Why he said what he said when he said it. All this in the middle of an ongoing adjustment I'm making myself, in my life. And,,,,, I offer all this to all free spirits that would consider these things. What do I get out of it??????

How about: "Hey, I read your stuff and don't like it. But, thanks for the effort".
OK! Fair enough.

How about: "Hey, you are all wet and here is my views why you are wrong".
OK! Fair enough.

How about: "Hey, that's interesting, thanks for the effort and here is another question if you can get around to it".
OK! Fair enough.

How about: "Hey, I don't buy it but your story is a process that's not finished yet, so keep talking and I'll keep an ear open.
OK! Fair enough.

You know, Another said a long time ago that we had said enough for most to follow. And he felt he had disclosed enough to average people,,,,, even how they could ride out what was coming. He was going to drop it until it all starts to unfold. Then start again. But I thought, being an American, that it would be interesting for everyone over here, if I just walked along and pointed out some of
the play by play action so the train of thought would not be lost to the average guy.

But then, I never realized that there were so many nuts in the world. Like that one that stomped Another at Kitco, endlessly. I thought they were few and far between. Then several of them even started in on me over here. I don't know, but it seems they all went to the same school,,,, or they are all the same person? Their line of reasoning always starts out as a regular discussion, then degrades into some personal attack. Again, always the same thought process saying: "you people are all being mind controlled if you discuss any of this with them". I have to ask you all ,,,,, What the hell is that anyway?,,,,,, what are they getting at?????

Now it comes to, when someone can't make his point, he switches directions and practically calls me an agent of drug dealers. Jesus! This is the absolute worst hit I can take!!!!!!!!

What is next? Will he ask Stranger, are you some agent dealing drugs with your trading in and out of NEM? How about Randy, will you be profiled as moving opium out the back a pick up, using the trading profits from your gold trading? Is there no limit to this?

I guess it would not be so bad, but,,,,Why is it everyone here presents themselves as conservative and glad to get them people out of the White House,,,,,, then several of us goes on to ask Thaigold to further his logic as to how Giants are moving dope along the Trail???????

Good God!!!!, how do you think this reflects on me and others on this side of the screen?

Well, go ahead and jump to that boy's website and while you are at it let him explain how the gold world works! Let these guys explain the reasoning of international politics and money flows,,,,,,,, even let them explain the
"Thoughts of Another",,, I damn sure won't now,,,,

Because I wouldn't want any of you having your kids see their parents discussing gold on the internet with some outlaw like me!!!!!!!!!! The more I think about this the hotter I get!!!!!

To all of you that have supported this effort, I thank you from my heart. And I will continue to hike the GoldTrail. But on that venue alone I will stay for a good long time!!!!!!!

Getting some fresh air.

I put on my boots, backpack, gloves, binoculars and went out walking the trail today. A fella came up and asked, "after yesterday, how ya doing"? I said follow me.

We went down to a stream and filled my bucket of water. I took off one glove and stuck a finger into the pail of water.

The water quickly started steaming and my friend jumped back with an expression like he couldn't believe what he just saw.

I said, "it's ok,,,,, this is a good sign because the water isn't boiling,,,,,, it means I'm cooling off!

Troy and Beyond, Even to Rome!
http://www.grifterrec.com/coins/timeline/timeline.html

Once again Randy, Hello and thank you for your efforts as the technical manager of this path! (smile)

Hello also, to all the others that have come to our hikes, walks and talks. We started this recent discussion, "going back into the beginnings of gold", right after our hike #54 "The Curve". There was good reasoning for stopping and camping here, because it was time to understand gold as few have ever understood it in our time. Taking a few days to overlook the valley from this spot will enhance our perceptions and prepare us for the next leg ahead.

So, grab your coffee and tea and lean back,,,,, the stars are out to light the night so our Thoughts alone may travel ---------- "The Gold Trail"!------

-----------------

Going back over #56 "The Gold of Troy":

You noticed that I structured that discussion in a way that makes the independent mind wonder about. Let's pull those thoughts together and move along.

We found that history had left us with some conclusions that were, it seems, never concluded. Archaeology had never been approached by someone like us, with a different hard money perspective. Yes, all the records were there, but most every paper written on the subject appeared carbon copy. They all projected our modern sense of money into the economic structures as they existed, back then. "Of course, we are today more complicated", our history papers said,,,, so,,,,,, allowing for that difference "the ancients still operated back then the same as us now". How neat!

Yes, our teachers "called our perception of money, their money and our perception of goods, their goods" in the same context we can use now. They said "hey, they were using hard money to buy and sell from each other, just like we once did" Again,,,,, how neat"!

---------------

The Treasures of Troy, all 259 items, were hidden away since 1945 because of various war and political problems. The significance of the find was tainted with scandal until only recently. Around 1994 (or 1995?+/-) the entire lot resurfaced in a museum in Moscow and several well respected scholars were finally able to examine and evaluate the exhibit and the actual site. Their conclusions? Using modern tools of the trade showed that while Schliemann did indeed find several lost cities stacked upon each other, his find went back further in time than anyone thought.

A recent book "The Gold of Troy" (April 1996) gives even further clarification.

From the author's works comes evidence that Troy was a ------ "leading center for gold jewelry making in western Asia Minor and the Aegean" --- " Thus the largest of the Trojan Treasures were Industrial in Nature and refute the supposition that they were objects in burial sights".-----


My research into many more papers and books, like the above and other written works, further shows that the sight was more of a grand market. With numbers of craftsmen in separate offices and work sites turning out some of the very finest gold metal works one could imagine. Even by today's standards. There were metal molds and crucibles found that were used for various metal working projects. We also conclude that the city was rebuilt several times over an extremely long slice of antiquity,,,, each time performing the same function of a trading town. All done during a slice of time that said gold coins did not trade as well as the other metal ones. Gold was saved, not traded.

Once again, returning to the theme of #56, there were virtually no coins found among the priceless gold art objects. Being a big gold trading town, worked over hundreds of years, certainly some gold coins would be around? Especially if gold and other metal coins were saved and used as money. But, none were around.

------------
Jumping back to:

The object of our viewpoint from #54 "The Curve", was to point out that gold today, has no currency price. Yet we are asked to value it on a gold for goods basis established by modern currency exchange rates. We wondered if the ratios in value between gold and goods, today could be the same as they were in ancient times and middle ages. If this ratio could be matched, we are told that the value yesterday and today would be much the same as our modern money says it is. I do wonder?

We buy and sell gold today, based upon the supply and demand of printing press contracts created on established exchanges around the world. In our present time, there is no trading price for gold based on the independent trading of physical gold alone. Or on the actual trading of gold goods, outright. All currency pricing and therefore modern accepted values for this metal is established on the paper derivatives markets.

To better grasp what we are really doing when buying real gold,,, close your eyes and imagine:

----- Today, we are simply "paying a fiat currency commission for the advantage of holding and owning physical gold metal"! ------ People that trade this paper system, exclusively, are simply betting on what that commission will be, not the eventual gold value. ------

----For actual gold obtainers, this function, that our exchange paper pricing mechanism is doing, is giving us metal for an unknown real price and value.------

I say "commission" in the above, because the total quoted price a coin dealer sells to you at, is little more than the world gold trading market's guess of the risk it is taking in supplying customers with the metal,,,,,, without a real market to establish it's currency price. It's that simple.(smile)

None of them and none of us know what the real value or price gold today is. I use the phrase; "our advantage of owning the metal", because buying physical gold for today's currency,,,,,,,is like buying a lifetime wealth option that never expires. The commission one pays for this gold coin position, in the for of what we call today's price,,,,,,, may one day go to almost zero as our paper market structure fails from the discovery of real price.

All happening because these physical gold options, we call real gold, return to actually trading for a value based on their worth in our world. It's the Physical Gold Advocate's "advantage", because while he is waiting for the real value to emerge, the real value that we know existed in antiquity has never gone away! It just doesn't have a marketplace to show it. It will.

All the while paper gold players are playing for scraps,,,, giving up their commissions,,,,, betting on the changing price of said "commission". Indeed, one that cannot go too far up without killing the entire system. And thinking it's the real price for gold they are betting on all the while.

"You think long and hard on that one? (smile)

For us, as hard money "Physical Gold Advocates", to understand the value of gold, we must remove ourselves from present time thought and think of gold as the Ancients did. Not as money but as little tradable hunks of metal. Gold for goods, straight up, as the citizens of Troy did!

-------------

Troy and Beyond, Even to Rome!

Back then, there was no other currency. No paper moneys or banks. One had no need to save gold as a hedge or savings account. Your wealth was in the useful things contained in the world around you. Those little hunks of metal were just that, little hunks of gold that everyone knew had trading value. They were not money, not the way we think of money today. They were just a beautiful metal, gold.

In fact, that is why you carried them, to use that gold if it brought the best deal in a trade. That was worth considering because they didn't always bring the best trade. Unless most of the time you were on the road. Within local communities, at least, goods for goods exchange always traded better than goods for gold. But over distance, the town next door or the seaport across the Aegean, those gold hunks could usually do better than the flask of oil you took with you. One made the best use of gold by using it, not saving it.

Unlike today, the laws of money were turned on end from our perception. Gold was for spending (trading) and spend it people did, especially "away from home". There were many non-gold coins around then, silver, electrum, bronze, iron, copper and they did something we cannot comprehend;

----"this bad money drove good money into circulation" ---- (smile).

Yes, the little metal chunk that carried the highest trading return was spent first! But why? Because the average person's wealth and savings accounts were denominated in the real useful things you owned and consumed during your short life. (See my #56 again to get the mind working) This, my friends is the reason the vast majority of physical gold stayed "on the road" of commerce while all the other metal coins were saved for later use. Gold traded best, so it traded first.

The common repeated ratio that during most of the Greek times a 1 to 10 value existed between silver and gold was official dogma and sounded about as right then as it does today. But, like today, it was seldom tested on an established exchange. That's because the coins had no denominations and were much less traded between themselves, not to mention there was no exchange! Anyone holding gold would be a fool to trade it for silver or any other metal because a trade for goods or services would surely bring a much higher return. The same was true for silver because it was better to risk a trade for goods than be taken in a trade for gold.

Back then, gold chunks were, by far, more rare and tradable than most any other coin produced. If it wasn't traveling by night or stayed too long in a trading town, it was quickly melted into the next generation of national coinage and sent packing again. Or it temporally became the object of a Troy metal craftsman's hand. You see, those little chunks of gold, I point out again, had no denomination of currency unit on them. They were fair game to become tradable gold in any form, be it bar, coin, chain or chip. The same rare gold made the circle between coin and "use object" many times over.

All of this is supported because aside the finds of major treasures, the finds in "working towns and homes" did have tiny gold objects of wealth but rarely did they have gold coins. The presents of these other tiny pieces of gold wealth in medium size homes indicates that they would have had the resources or incomes to use gold coins as trading vehicles,,,,,,, but they did not have the resources to tie up that much wealth by saving coins of gold! That same "logic train" negates the premise that these same working people couldn't afford gold and therefore used lesser metals as coinage in equal value or in a 1 to 10 ratio of gold! They did use these other coins, but used them less. Gold finds, relative to other coins are rare because it was always spent. Place yourself in their times?

Again, people "did" often have and save "other" metal coins. So many, in fact that great numbers of these bronze, silver, etc. coins keep being found at dig sites today, all across Europe and Asia minor. Many of them found right in the same "regular" backyard saving accounts we ourselves sometimes use. Planted long ago as the next best trading item one could store and not lose too much "use wealth" during the wait. Indeed, these lesser items could afford to be put away.

But, you thought silver was more in style as a coinage then, because so much of it survived? If that were the case, those metal items would have made the exact same trip gold did. They would have been melted down and reused into jewelry and coins, never laying down for rest in such great numbers. (good logic, yes?)

I'll read several partials from these written pieces:

PARTHIA:
-------Some of the most interesting ancient coins were neither 'Greek' or 'Roman'. In fact, the coin producing civilizations of the ancient world spread far across Asia including people and places rarely mentioned in beginning World History classes. One of the most well known of these were the rulers of much of what is today Iran, Iraq and surrounding regions: the Parthians.----------

--------The land areas of ancient Parthia lay between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, and its boundaries included all of modern Iran and contained portions of what are now modern Iraq, Turkey, Armenia, Azarbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan---------

--------(it) roughly corresponds to modern Iran, was approximately 648,000 square miles, about equal to the areas of Great Britain, France, Germany and Spain together ----

----------The Parthians created an empire which, at its height, presented Rome with a serious challenge for the control of the Middle East west of the Euphrates river. They were the only civilized power to withstand the might of Rome at its height- the same Romans who had conquered Carthage, Macedon, the Seleucids, and the Gauls. So, who were these Parthians, whose empire stretched from the Hindu Kush to Mesopotamia? ----- (They) created an empire which lasted for almost 500 years (and) have been so nearly forgotten ----------

---------The Parthian kingdom began with the election of Arsaces I to the kingship of the Parni in 247 BC.--------- In 238 BC, Arsaces I succeeded in defeating the Seleucid governor of Parthia and establishing the Parthian kingdom. With his accession, ***** the coinage of Parthia begins, and would continue, with only a short break, for the next 500 years. This coinage has proven extremely important for Parthian history for several reasons; primarily because of the scarcity of written records - the Parthians themselves did not leave behind any written legacy---------------- For the majority of Parthian history we have to rely on a combination of fragmentary literary sources and references, archaeology, and the coinage itself to create a coherent, though incomplete, story.****

------------- *** Their coinage formed the medium through which western, in particular Greek, ideas of coin design were transmitted, and transmuted, in the Middle East from the Euphrates to the Indus and beyond. The Parthians developed one of the first recognizably feudal systems on record- which was transmitted to the Sassanians, and thence to the Arabs. **** The Persian epic history is now thought to include lengthy portions from the Parthian era - the Parthians had a great oral tradition, in keeping with their nomadic background, and greatly valued BARDS and story-telling. The Parthians also left a legacy in art and architecture, creating a style that mixed Hellenism with native Persian influences, particularly in ornamental metal work. There is even a small literary legacy with the "Parthian shot" - a phrase taken from Parthian horse-archer tactics in which the archer would feign flight, and, while riding away, fire over the back of their horse -----------

---------Their economy and success was based on taxes paid by traders using the 'Silk Road' that connected Rome and the West with China and the East. Parthian finances depended greatly on Rome's failure to make direct contact with China until the late second century AD. Parthians were known for being men of their word and their coins continued to be issued with fair weight of good silver long after Roman silver coins were being debased.------------------
--------------------------------

Well;
here we find a major civilization that existed during most of the early BC Greek periods and crossed well into AD Roman period. We have found that their coinage tells set the pace for much of that time.

Most of the coinage, we have dug up today, from that period and part of the world was in the lesser metals of silver, bronze, etc.. Even the Persian, preceding the Parthia, had most of their coins in silver form. This, no doubt, lead to our present hard money education that silver was as good or better than gold, back then. The fact is, as we are concluding, that gold and gold coins were made back then and circulated more widely because of their value. The mere existence of gold coins (those little hunks of tradable gold) supports this concept of their use. Indeed, their rarity today indicates their value, back then as most of them were recoined. Leaving only lesser coins behind.

The Persian king, Darius The Great, did issue gold Darics right along with silver Sigloi and did so as early as 500 - 490 BC. This we all know and agree. But so few of them survived, modern thought created the view that gold was far too scarce to be much used as a complete tradable unit back then. But this view takes on the same arguments we hear today, always leaving out the possibility that gold value was much higher. Carrying a larger share of wealth with less metal. It was scarce, but that isn't what erased their record of existence. Gold was used so well and needed so much that it was always "in trade" and "on the road". If it wasn't, it was melted into Another countries wealth.

However, it was the recent discovery of Parthian gold coins that best supports a change in concept for hard money followers. It was thought that gold was not used in that land and trade from Greek nations was always done in the lesser Parthian metals.

In 1982, in an archaeological dig at Tillya-tepe, a real Parthian gold coin was found (a Gotarzes I (95-90 B.C.). Later in 1991, several Vonones I (A.D. 8-12) were found as authentic! While the archeological significance of these coins is still hotly debated, I am aware that there is a supporting passage in an Ashmolean Museum piece, where around 94 BC the process of working gold is mentioned in Parthia. The existence today, of known gold working and trading, in this era, opens up the entire hard money proposition about the evolution of gold as wealth. If gold was traded, there was enough for coinage trade too. The Parthian find completes our supposition that gold moved freely between nation states then. Indeed, the workings of gold at Troy, a stop off on a major trade route between these cultures, adds to this. The fact that Greek coinage, in gold, was also widely used, even as it was rare in that nation's borders, means that Greek gold and coins had to have also come mostly from supplies "on the road" as they passed through the region. This concept demonstrates that gold moved and during that movement was coined, often.

In fact the earliest Greek gold coins (The Head of Zeus) came from their colonies on Sicily and in Tarentum on the Italian mainland. Not on their local soil.

The same argument was applied to gold use pertaining to the Greeks. Because gold was indeed hard to find around their local area, many concluded that the few Greek coins produced in this early time were done so from necessity and as a last resort. As we pointed out before, Troy changed that perception because gold is now known to have been a long established trade item, subject to the craftsman's hand. In fact, several examples of gold coins with holes in them indicate they may have been hung as jewelry in chain. Gold was rare and was melted if it held still too long. But, it carried a higher value in trade than any other coin across all of middle asia.

For a "Timeline" view of these cultures - link above. -

At that site, we can see how the Parthians walked right along side the Roman development even as they passed through Troy along the way. All during the same era. Their timeline use of gold coins now offers an counter concept against accepted hard money thought based solely upon Greek and Roman history alone.

----------------------
Further:

Following the death of Philip II of Macedon, his son Alexander The Great spent the last 13 of his 33 years life changing the world. The gold coin of "Macedon, named Alexander the Great, stater, (336 - 323 BC) became "The Coin" and standard of the world for some time. He set the precedent of "recoinage" by melting down the gold of other nations into his stater piece. It is in our view that his practice had more of an impact on perceived known gold stores than most everyone accepts. His people did work the mines for gold, but produced far less of it than imagined. Rather, his mints were ordered to melt and restamp any and all gold that passed their way. Most of it was "gold on the move" as was the custom of his time and before. Rather than adding greatly to the existing gold supply, he just better identified what was already being used in commerce.


That practice was something the early Roman era planers would not understand until after most of their Roman Republic years had passed. Truly, Roman stamped gold during the Republic years, would be very rare (as it is today). At first relying greatly on other's gold coinage as a tradable unit. Only later did their armies melt captured gold for government storage. Following in the "Footsteps" of a process that continues to convert existing gold into identifiable gold. Even into our day.

It wasn't until the era of Roman dominance that they recognized the need for Roman tradable gold. Gold in their name for use away from home by their armies. During this time the first Roman "aureus" were struck by their armies. Coins created from "taken" gold, already in use, was formed into the very best trading chunks a soldier could have. The coin "Lucius Manius" (82-81BC) aureus, was one of the many created after the Roman Senate allowed their generals to coin "taken" gold as trading money. Thus begins one of the greatest gatherings and usage of gold known at that time. Some of it the very same gold we use today.

If one read my posts during the Washington Agreement period, you will recognize the phrase "On the Road"! Beyond the obvious political reasoning we often present here, the case for "to little gold today" has been behind our motivations for some time. The gold in our world is not as great as so many suppose it is. I hope to demonstrate why this gold "on the road" concept will further influence our political currency situation as it evolves.

Let's stop now and continue later.

Thank you all for your support and kind words.

ALL:
Again, I thank everyone for their contributions here and for the chance it gives others to see how a good cross segment of hard money people think. Your posts are valuable to all that read here as they convey every aspect of understanding, from deep thought to personal responses in our changing world.

I have mentioned to USAGOLD that I will never reply to a post in a negative way again. In the future, it must be the managers / owners of this site that instill what flavor it will have, not any of us (me) with our human outcries. Thank you all for reading and supporting this venue.

USAGOLD #47148:

Thank you, Michael, for your noting my piece on the trail. There is much more to this talk as it will explain how this gold dynamic is being used for political objectives today. I hope it leads to a better understanding of, at least, the fundamental forces that have created "This New Gold Market".

Randy #47141:
Thank you, also and I will follow up on your thinking in the next Trails Talk.

------------------

ORO -- #47214 -- Euro roost

Sir, you have, more so, than many of us, offered such a fine commentary over time. I know you realize it would be impossible to reply or even comment on the full content of everything you present. I think you also realize that my drive here has been to point out bits and pieces, more so
than make full conclusions. All done in the spirit of education and extending individual awareness of the future before us, thru gold.

Some time in the future, if events progress enough, I would like a dialog with you that is more than just a small point from my end. Until then, I will simply comment, as able and appropriate in following the political trail. In that spirit, I want to comment on your post next week. I have this to add today:

----------------

We all attempt, if the drive is in us, not to only understand, but also influence the leaders that work for us. In that respect, as a nation state, country, or society of peoples, our eventual goal must be more than just life itself.

This vessel we call life, this planet of us, this body of soles nearest our abode, is far too all consuming for any one master or group of masters to guide or even control by themselves. In this, every one among us should strive to add their difference. But none should be so bold not to lose track of what the world is here for; enjoying and living the time we have.

If lucky, some make it up several decks on our ship and even see the captain's view on occasion. If even more fortunate, he might have a word with the mind that is the wheel. It isn't always what we want to hear:

---------------

this life is so large our cargo so great
we trust you know how to go

Of course say he with clarity in sight
from my direction my assistants do know

with blank map in hand he makes his plan
and tugs with a tear then a bow

later, admits he, I must swear to thee
the land HO we seek, must still grow

----------------

So, my ORO that shines as gold, after the trip perhaps our experience will be a recount of a journey that was maped along the way. No matter the outcome, no matter the path taken we are all just people on the river of life.

As the "NewGuy" said of the one deemed more knowing in my story of the Country Club Bar #45944---

Support for euro soars among
London bosses - poll

---LONDON (Reuters) - Support for Britain's entry into Europe's single currency has soared among company bosses in London, a London Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey showed today. --- The proportion of the capital's top executives in favour of entry "as soon as possible"
has doubled during the last 18 months to 40 percent, according to the poll ----------------The poll, published in the London Evening Standard newspaper, found that a further 36 percent favoured entry "within the next few years", bringing total support for joining the euro to 76
percent.--------The Labour party is committed in principle to joining Europe's single currency club--------

-----------------------

Ok, now they are getting the drift! Also take a look at Pandagold's:

"......GORDON BROWN made a profit from selling some of the UK's gold reserves and investing in the ailing euro currency, MPs were told yesterday. A senior Treasury official said that, even though the euro had fallen in value, not lost out because investments in euros also paid interest, unlike gold. Gus O'Donnell, also insisted the Chancellor's policy of selling gold was not related to the Government's desire to join the euro.............

-------------------------

Ha! Ha! Old "GUS" read that last line from pre-printed material,,,,, don't you think? With the Euro and it's economy, also forming a powerful base, and it's coming policy about gold, the Brits won't need as much gold as a government money reserve. Because the ECB will allow this new non - money asset to rise like never before! Especially in dollars! And that thought gives big paper gold traders the shakes, as it's (paper gold marketplace) trading value is based on a dollar price band remaining in place. Soooo, HM government is saving a few of them (big BBs) before EMU.

Don't forget to notice the item in today's WSJ about how Euro-zone producer prices fell in december! This does not sound to me or to the Brits like a world currency that was being printed as "social trash paper" does it?

Let me see,,, if the ECB keeps rates from falling too fast and the USA keeps rates falling to ensure it's overheated economy ,,,,, then something of a shift in in world opinion about reserve money is coming? No?

Also:
It looks like more of the miners are doing something "who would have thought of"??? ,,,, dump all their real gold into the gold paper market. It would not take a rocket scientist to see how their financial structure demands nothing less? Yet, investors are still clinging to the ideal that all these securities are a proxy for "real gold"!!!! This could eventually lead to the failure of paper gold and / or the total loss of "equity" value for most mine shares?????? More than a few paper traders will feel the sting of buying paper gold based on it's ongoing paper pricing of real physical metal.

Some mines will, indeed,,,, make it across this valley,,,,,, and still have massive reserves intact. But, for the thinking gold advocate,,,,,, playing all the speculative metals and mine securities for a quick profit will only produce quick loses,,,,, no? Today, every aspect of perceived value in the gold arena is an illusion based on an "unknown",,,,,, the "unknown" trading price of physical gold.

The real leverage today, is found in the "hunk" of real gold in one's hand. That value will be shown at "Another" time.

Treasury Secretary Rejects Lecturing Tokyo

WASHINGTON President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary plans a new U.S. approach for dealing with Japan, as the world's largest and second-largest economies appear headed into decline. -------------------------------- The combined effect of slumps in both countries, which together make up about 40 percent of the global economy, is being felt worldwide. Yet politicians and bureaucrats in Japan appear to be invoking the same prescriptions - hundreds of billions of dollars of more deficit spending by the government - that have repeatedly failed to get the country growing again. ------------------- He said, for example, that he was not interested in lengthy, vague discussion of Japan's myriad regulations. Instead, he said, he wanted to introduce "price competition" to Japan, noting that it was exactly that kind of competition from abroad that rebuilt U.S. industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ----------- But the same Japanese executives with whom Mr. O'Neill says he wants to deal directly have spent years fighting against low-priced competition, both foreign and domestic. --------------

------------------------

With no where to turn, no new initiatives to tap and arriving at a timeline change in international currency values; both these countries are about to take a path of no return. As this downturn begins to bite, our collective governments will be forced to buy up every asset necessary. All just to keep the fires burning! This is the classic threshold of an intense inflation.

It makes me recall a line from Red October, the movie,,,,,, where the Russian submarine captain (played by our retired 007) disposes of his KGB counterpart just before stealing the ship! He says:

---- "to where I am going, you cannot follow"-------

Indeed, where the dollar universe is now heading, no nation should follow! Can you spell hyperinflation? In Japanese?

A Despondent Japan Seeks Some Answers
Howard W. French New York Times Service
Wednesday, February 7, 2001

The fearful talk in Tokyo financial circles for more than a month has been the possible collapse of the banking system. Banks never recovered from the bursting of Japan's speculative bubble in 1990 and remain saddled with an untold, and undisclosed, sea of unrecoverable debts. If defaulting creditors set off a wave of failures, it would mark the second time in two years that the country has experienced a banking crisis. ----------------------------- Growing numbers of Japanese economists maintain that the postwar obsession with exports is a major part of the
problem. According to this view, the welfare of Japanese people has been sacrificed in the name of mobilizing capital toward exports instead of developing goods for local consumption.----------- As a result, the public has been stuck with tiny, expensive homes in overcrowded neighborhoods, high prices on consumer goods and few affordable options for day care or elderly care. Japan's
electronic brands are known worldwide, but many Japanese do not own a clothes dryer or dishwasher. Young women are increasingly revolting against the system by postponing marriage and children. -------------- "The Japanese focus has never been on making Japanese richer, their lives happier or more convenient and predictable," said Haruo Shimada, an economist at Keio University. "All of our energy has been focused on competing with the United States."

----------------------

Most Western people do not know the Japan that resides in the last several lines above. We have always been told that they are rich with savings. I know this land of the Yen and their image was never as good as we were told.

Interest rate cut in euro zone some way off - ECB
http://www.ireland.com/business/news/2001/0208/news3.htm

By Jane Suiter, Economics Editor

Interest rate cuts are still some way off, according to two of the most senior figures in the European Central Bank.

Strong data from Germany have bolstered ECB hopes that Europe can withstand the slowdown in the US.

Yesterday, the Bundesbank president, Mr Ernst Welteke, repeated his view that the time was not right yet for a cut in euro zone interest rates but the ECB was closely watching what kind of impact the US slowdown might have.

"We still feel it is not yet the time to reduce interest rates," Mr Welteke, a member of the ECB's governing council, told CNN International.

**********
German manufacturing orders jumped 2.7 per cent in December, far higher than the market had been predicting. French consumer confidence also hit a record high in January.
*********

The data also boosted the euro, which rose above $0.93, closing at $0.9333 from $0.9308 a day earlier.

********
The currency could move back to parity with the dollar in the coming months, said Mr Horst Siebert, one of the German government's panel of independent economic advisers, in a magazine interview this week.

"It is feasible that the euro will move back towards dollar parity," he said in an interview to be published in today's edition of the German weekly

BRITAIN must allay US fears about the new European Rapid Reaction Force, Robin Cook said yesterday.

Speaking after meeting Gen Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, in Washington, the Foreign Secretary said that the force could strengthen Nato. Gen Powell said he was encouraged by Mr Cook's promise that it would not be a rival. He said: "If we approach the European Strategic Defence Initiative in the way that Robin and I have discussed, then there's no reason to see this de-stabilising Nato in any way." Mr Cook reassured Gen Powell that Britain was fully committed to the Anglo-American relationship.--------------

For myself; our gold story has been one of an unfolding drama between two long time forces in our world. The USA and The Old World,,,,, Europe. The entire play can been seen best through the eyes of gold,,,,, it's evolution,,,,, it's use as a political medium,,,,, and it's eventual impact on the failing dollar system. Never before in our history has physical gold been used as such an article of political change. Indeed, not since the ancient times will it have shown such a value in human affairs. Tomorrow, the future wealth of many will be stored in just such a medium and the impact of such stored wealth will never be greater in our lives.

Yes BuenaFe, the fuse is indeed lit! (smile)

---------

Over on the Gold Eagle Forum an excellent piece was written by Mr. Lawrence Parks. See link above. We should read the entire article and after reading it, please consider my position. I want to reproduce parts of it here and then comment:

--------------------------------------------

It's Not Your Daddy's Gold Anymore --- by Lawrence Parks

As recently as 30 years ago, some people bought and held gold not because they thought it was a "store of value," a concept that is intellectually defective and empirically indefensible, but because they had historical memory that gold is money. Today, as the older generation passes on, the new generation is tragically getting rid of inherited gold just as the reasons to hold it are becoming more imperative. ---------------

-------Indeed, all around the world, in Mexico, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and else where paper-ticket fiat monies are collapsing. While Europe is well on its way to adopting a single currency, the Euro, and there are mutterings about a single Asian currency, there is not yet a call for gold.---------

----In contrast with the older generation who understood the role of gold, the reasons some folks hold gold today are almost all fallacious. They include mistaken notions such as:

(1) gold is a hedge against inflation. (This has not been true for the last eighteen years.);

(2) gold is a proven asset. (In fact, for the last eighteen years, the opportunity cost of investing in
gold has been staggering!);

(3) gold is a good diversifier since it is inversely correlated with the equity market. (Flushing money
down the toilet as the S&P goes up is also inversely correlated with the equity market, but who
would do that?);

(4) gold is cheap compared to its history. (This says nothing about why it is cheap. It is cheap
because there is just too much of it for the purposes for which it is being used.); and,

(5) there is a shortage of gold production compared to that used in jewelry fabrication. (But this is meaningless because there is more than a fifty-year supply above ground. No other commodity except silver, which has also played a monetary role has even a one-year supply above ground.)
------------

------- There's more to this, but you get the point. Since these perceptions are wrong and people are recognizing that they are wrong, as the older generation passes, inheritors are getting rid of their gold. Gold will have its day when the fiat dollar collapses and people once again demand
gold-as-money. Then, and only then, will there be a reason to guarantee future payment to save and store gold. The payback to people who have the foresight to have held gold will be astonishing. -------------------------

Dr. Lawrence Parks is Executive Director of FAME, the Foundation for the Advancement of Monetary Education, and a member of Workers' Education Local 189, CWA, AFL-CIO.

---------------

Thank you Mr. Parks for your fine thoughts to the gold advocate public.

I also perceive the market in exactly the same light, as do most Western children of gold owning parents. However this view does not address the total evolution of gold, only one small timeline portion. On the USAGOLD GoldTrails page we are in the beginnings of going all the way back, in an effort to demonstrate what gold was then and how it will return to those values tomorrow.

One of the great problems with gold advocates today, has been in their failure to recognize whether the current world currency price of gold represents the real trading value for actual physical gold. This facade has been the source of much of the mis-perception you outlined over the last 18 year timeframe. As we have demonstrated so many times, the trading of gold has morphed (good word, uh? Perhaps metamorphosis?) into the trading of contracts. These paper markets have served to drain away and replace physical gold demand. If an actual physical traded market existed, based in total on actual movement of bullion, the real value and real dollar price for gold would be known. Therefore, the paper prices today are, as I pointed out before, little more than a commission paid to cover the physical delivery risk in this morphed gold marketplace.

Look back and place yourself in France, around 1965. One could have had gold for around $35 or $40+/- US dollars. What would you have thought if someone told you that by 1980, that gold price you paid in 1965 was equal to the commission on some bullion coin trades at the new high
prices? "Nuts", would have been the reply.

Today, as the ECB / BIS begins to once again morph the marketplace, our dollar price in gold will once again be headed towards becomming the commission price. Of course, my analogy is in a different scope and context, but the precedent of such an actual percentage move is already priced into physical stores of gold. The inflation of dollar currency has already been measured in gold. We and the children, just cannot see it because we are looking at an illusion.

Current background
http://www.usagold.com/dailyquotes.html

Hello everyone!

I was going to post this on the Main Gold Forum page because I didn't want to break the chain of thought here. But, because it's so long,,, I'll post here and reference this item on the trail later.

If a gold advocate reads Michael's wonderful piece (see link above), all the reasons for buying gold should be clear. His sound purpose is certainly clear to me. But, far too many savers have been lost in the blizzard of conflicting stories about gold. With all the changes that are taking place now, many have just backed away.

After giving my talk about "the curve" (along with other talks), I hope that at least a firm perception is in place as to why our current gold prices are little more than a facade. A currency price based mostly on the trading of contracts, not gold itself. Most of you grasp this, yet wonder why the "facade price keeps falling?

I'll use some things from the Carl H post the other day (Carl H (02/07/01; 20:05:56MT - usagold.com msg#: 47727)

Hi Carl, I'll comment first them start into your post:
-------

From where I sit:

There were two distinct parts to our (Another and my words as added) commentary over the last several years. Political history buffs would have recognized it right off and spotted where we were going with it. For the most part, all of this discussion was centered around the decades old combat between the Old World and our Western World. I'm talking about the combat for economic domination.

For those of you too young or not versed in recent history, during the last 30 years, most of Europe has been trying to work itself out from under American financial influence. This has shown itself so often it would take an entire documentary to reproduce or explain. Perhaps, larger than History of the world vol 1 thru 17 (smile). For us, though, the most important aspect of this has been in the slow formation of European economic unity. In fits and starts they have worked their way through various currency blocks that embarked on all sorts of fixed exchange rates and trade agreements.

The metamorphosis of their most recent 20 year struggle resulted in today's Euro and the expanding zone of financial structure it represents. This is only the most recent example of an effort that started somewhere back before our time. Perhaps the European Economic Unit (ECU) could pinpoint the modern beginnings of this struggle. Again, this represents the most recent 20 year segment.

The world's economic timeline will no doubt look back and mark this period in a way that we mark ancient history. I think most scholars will use the BC / AD reference as a way to describe it. Perhaps BE / AD, meaning "Before EMU" and After (dead) Dollars. The currency birth and political movement we have just witnessed will indeed have just such an impact on our Western lives and truly require a time stamp to reference it.

---------------

In the BE period, gold was the only other world currency. Yes, this dethroned metal currency and wealth asset was still used the world over as a last resort. A last resort against a failing dollar, that is. Gold values, BE, went through many convulsions as the dollar's use and stability ebbed and flowed. All the while, the world held gold "just in case".

As the political motivations to create a "Euro system and currency" grew, many nation states found themselves at economic risk. They hedged their economy between dollars and gold, but wanted the new possibilities another economic zone could offer. It was a new way to break the total economic control of our dollar reserve system. Everyone, it seems were watching and maneuvering as EMU approached.

The problem for many wealthy states was: how to continue within world economic trade, save your currency exchange wealth in reserve and not be killed if this new Euro system became a huge success? For some, gold was the main conduit to hold your excess reserves in, that way you were between currencies. But there were several problems.

----------------

The dollar had already approached it's useful life several times. By the early 90s, it was a basket debt case of super currency expansion. Ready to fail, right then and there! It was kept alive through CB participation, because it remained "the" world reserve and we could not operate without it. As the modern world evolved, digital currencies of fiat nature were and will remain the number one way to do trade. No matter the costs or problems entailed in their use, or how often these worthless papers come and go, humanity uses and demands their presence. We have but to go no further than into several of today's currency inflating nations to see where the locals still use paper money. My point here is to not expect a return to hard money. Hard wealth as savings, yes. But hard money? Never again. See my other posts for further explanation.

Make no mistake, CB support for our US unit is the only reason it's exchange rate didn't plunge, throwing us into a massive, local price inflation. And, because most other countries held dollars as a reserve, they would have inflated also. All this support was done in order to stop a complete economic trade breakdown before EMU. A decades long wait.

The trick for the CBs was to keep holding dollars and even expanding those holdings as needed to balance US trade deficits. Deficits, by the way that have not only been negative for a long time, but have grown explosively during the 90s and right up and thru EMU. This dollar support made sense because holding reserves in a failing currency, while building a new one offered little loss potential. Yes, once the new system began to function, your dollar holding's value would eventually be reduced almost to nothing. But those reserves only represented support for the system itself, not actual buying power in the native currency's land, USA. You see, once a permanent trade deficit becomes structural to the function of the currency's economy, those dollars,,,,,, those units of reserve buying power,,, can never return for the purchase of anything! Without killing the exchange rates and native economic structure first. Yes, in the case of what comes first (chicken or egg), you cannot send dollars home to buy useful goods at a reasonable price if the whole trade structure fails. In the US's example, used here, local inflation would drive the dollar prices of everything we export through the roof, long before all the goods were brought. Completely, negating any and all exchange gains from a falling dollar exchange rate.

So,,,,, once the Euro was functioning and morphing into it's new reserve roll, the ECB would,,,, like in the US's present roll,,,,, have no need for excess foreign cash reserves. However, some wealth structure would have to be present in the asset reserve category to replace those lost dollar values as they failed. That structure would be gold. More problems.

Prior to and just after EMU, many oil producers and a whole host of other wealthy nations / individuals, were not going to buy into the Euro first off. What if it failed? Or worse, because the dollar was on it's last legs of support already, any failure of the Euro system package would also lead to a total break away of continued support for the dollar. In this dynamic, even dollar holdings could dissolve! This was the background from where Another's Thoughts were being broadcast. During the BE period, about five years before, there was indeed a near failure to proceed with EMU! After some 20+ years of effort, such a failure would have sent us back to the gold standard (and worse) of days gone by. Many of you can remember this during the 1995 area. The effort seemed to be falling from political bickering. It was critical to oil wealth producers and many others that the Euro be born. If it didn't, an all out bid for real gold by everyone would ensue and I mean everyone. More problems.

Part of the support package for continued use of dollars revolved around oil. If for any reason, oil prices rose prior to EMU, it would break what little economic life that remained. It was well known that the entire local US structure depended and was built on reasonable priced oil. Later, this position and it's pricing dynamic would begin the movement of commerce settlement away from dollars. But, not yet. Actually, in the years prior to EMU, oil needed to plunge in dollar value in order to prop up the system. It did, boy did it,,,,, but not for free as so many thought.

It was well known that gold could buy oil, or better said,,,,, a cheap gold market price would buy cheap oil! But forcing down the gold price for the benefit of private sales would be some effort as long as people were buying in mass prior to EMU. That mass buying process would feed on itself from the fear of a dollar / Euro transition. Thereby, negating the whole cheap gold for oil game. Yet, the ECB (and the BIS) already knew this gold market of ours and knew it well. You see, our dollar gold market has evolved over many years. Long before the 90s, it was well on it's way to becoming a virtual paper market place. An easy trading market that basically held "it's paper gold price" well within the commodity use function of gold. Around $400 to $600 was considered about right. With Western views sliding into complacency as our world dominance grew, we as investors grew to see "trading gold" as the best use of our wealth. If we wanted to engage hard money thought at all, we just traded the price, not own the gold. In this atmosphere the mine industry exploded with easy capital. See my post about Mr. Parks great article below. So we as private gold owners unloaded tonnes of gold many started down the road of owning leveraged gold securities instead.

In this backdrop, new mine supply was more than what the world needed, at least the Western world. All the CBs, both American and Old World, began a policy of discounting gold. All for the purpose of supporting the dollar reserve system. Yes, the US played this game, knowing full well the currency reasons behind the Old World purpose; to hold the dollar steady until Euro birth (EMU). You see, we (USA) thought this was great because we gave the chance of EMU a one in 100 shot! This truly backfired and now the BIS / ECB have the US fed in an inflation trap.

So, the dollar got support from CB's holding more of it as a reserve,,,,,, the dollar got support from a falling gold price,,,,,, the dollar and the economy behind it got support from crashing oil prices. All of this leading up to a huge change. A change that to this day is still mostly behind the screens.

The next part of the play came as world paper gold traders starting making use of a good thing,, falling dollar gold prices! Never mind that the real gold movement behind the paper market was becoming a tiny fraction of this paper trading. Never mind that the dollar would eventually step back from world reserve status,,,, changing the settlement function of our paper gold market overnight and killing everyone's paper holdings. They said:
----"Why,,,, we know why gold prices are falling, the CBs of the world want it down,,,,,, but we don't believe all this talk of Euro success",,, "there are a hoard of other reasons", "besides, we are making tons of money playing this paper game"!-------
------------

Now, I'll pause to introduce some items from Mr. Carl H's post.
-----
Section 1 -- Bullion Banks Establish the Gold Carry Trade

From what I have read, it seems that a few years ago a number of Bullion Banks started borrowing gold at interest rates of around 1% from Central banks. This gold was immediately sold on the spot market and the money and invested it in higher yielding investments. This type of operation is referred to as a carry trade. This practice went unchecked and has reached a point where at least 6000 tons and probably as much as 10000tons of gold are owed to the central banks. To put these numbers in perspective, annual world wide mine production is estimated to be about 2500 tons.
-------------
Thank You Carl.

Yes, they did introduce the gold carry trade then and the timing was no accident. I also have to point out that Another was the very first to mention (post) a gold lending number anywhere near that level. He said it was around 14,000 many years ago or would soon approach that level. Everyone, except those that knew the game, said it was NUTS! Now, the 10,000 figure is on every desk in the world.

Central Bank lending of gold for low rates made absolutely no sense. A fact almost every hard money writer expresses. But, they fail to bridge the conclusion. If a low gold price was wanted, and they did indeed want it, the CBs could have sold the gold outright, driving it down. Then brought it back later. With the growing public perception, so well outlined in Mr. Parks article, no one would have minded it as the stock markets were all the rage. Why buy into a diving market and hoard all this excess gold for long.

Further, in a different light, the CBs could have simply used the mining industry strategy and apply the interest gained on the cash sale proceeds to buy the gold back later at higher prices. Indeed, this is exactly what the mines are doing now.

Further: They didn't need to lend it, just sell it. Later, they could have just printed new money, that is, create near money securities for their own account and apply them to long term contracts from the industry,,,,, buying new mined gold to replace the sold gold. No need for the lending equation at all. But, you see, there was a need.

So,,,, the only reasonable, legal reason for the banks to create a world wide gold lending structure was to grow a paper facade that the real gold buying, Another spoke of, could hide in. All perfectly legal, but very political. Again, I point to Another's long ago post that said; "the reason gold prices are falling is because so many people are buying it". Ha! Ha! That one was greeted with total disbelief and ridicule. But, boy a lot of money was lost by people that turned from that message.

Now, back to my post:

-----------
In the middle of all this new paper trading environment, people didn't notice what was happening. Way back when CB lending was just beginning, some smart people starting taking just a little bit of the action. Besides being big buyers of CB gold sold outright, they were also buying some of the borrowed gold. The same gold that was lent into the market by the CBs and other big players. You know, the gold that's borrowed, sold to create a pot of money. Then that money draws interest until it's used to buy the new mined gold and replace the loaned stuff. The same process that also makes the gold carry trade in our currency markets.

Well, that real gold off take, done by these major gold advocates, was not all they they took (smile).

Now,,,, a lot of these people started thinking. "We already have a lot of gold and our demands in the decade prior to EMU may drive the market way up. So, why not help the CB's purpose (and ours) by always bidding low at outright sales. And because our money is tied up in gold, drawing no interest, why not play the CB game for them? We'll take some of our buying money and use it to create the cash pot for the BBs,,,, for use in their gold lending deals. They can skip the borrowing and sale of gold part and just commit our money to pay for the new mined gold. Drawing the standard few percent in return. The mines don't need to know that no gold was sold. Further, the BBs will need to hedge a fall in price to protect themselves in the deal. In doing so the public will see the derivatives price of gold fall, just as if some was sold.

Note: The BBs (in this small niche of deals) must only protect their interest from a falling market because that is the only function that would threaten the mine's future repayment of gold,,,,, a to low gold price. If their collective actions did drive the paper trading of gold to the floor, killing 90% of the industry's ability to continue operation, their profits from their paper hedge could at least cover the liability. Yet, conversely, any rise in price would be no threat to this particular deal structure.

So,,,,,,in the middle of all the gold carry trade, naked shorting, gold sales from regular investors and, in general, a blizzard of paper gold trading,,,,,, some major players were building real gold buys and not driving the markets as they did it. The success of this operation created the dynamic that allowed physical gold to be purchased off the radar screen and the flow of oil to continue. Once again, no manipulation outside our standard paper arena! As Another was oh so fond of saying: "gold and oil will never flow in the same direction". (smile) Now, more from Mr. Carl H:

----------------------------------------
Section 2 -- Lining up the Gold to Unwind the Carry Trade

I consider the above paragraph to be fairly well established information. Now, I will speculate for a moment. If I were the bullion bankers and was in this situation, I would want to get my hands on a tremendous amount of physical gold at cheap prices. As far as I know, only the central banks and mining companies have large amounts of physical gold. In the case of the mining companies, it is still in the ground. I will assume here that the central banks would be very reluctant to let the bullion banks default. It would show how stupid or corrupt the central bankers are and it might be a big enough scandal to change the outcome of some elections. Ok, so this means that I have to convince the mining companies to sell me all the gold they produce for the next several years at prices close to what they are currently. So, how would one go about convincing the mining companies to sell their future production? Youíd either have to convince them that the price of gold was going to stay low for the period of time for which you wanted them to sell you the production or you would have to coerce them into selling future production. To accomplish this, you would have to convince them that there was a large supply of gold that was going to be dumped on the market. As stated above, the only other large holder of gold is the central banks. So, you have to convince the central banks to drive down the price of gold and act like they are ready to dump much more gold.

So, the question then is how to separate a central banker and his gold. Simple, create a potential crisis of a magnitude that it will force him to sell gold to prevent it. This is easily done by simply writing a huge gold call options (or surrogates thereof). Then, if the price of gold rises, the Bullion banks will fail and probably take the financial system with them. This compels the central banks to cap the price of gold at a level that less than the cost of production for many mines. This forces those mines to hedge or go bankrupt. The Bullion Banks can then acquire the forward production at prices near the cost of production, or to acquire the bankrupt mine. What is even better is that hedging will help hold down the price and force other mining companies to hedge.
--------------------

OK,,,,,,,,,, again thanks Carl.

Your view above is very clear. But it is based on several lines of thought that don't exist.

(First), the BBs are not really at risk. Yes, in my macro view, if the gold system was to default out of sequence, world trade flows would indeed, break most of the BB, but do it from the regular economic side of their structure. However:

It's the function of the marketplace, itself, along with the entire gold marketplace that's at risk. In the event of a total run on gold, induced by a huge surge in gold demand, the banks would force their clients, on the short side, to post so much collateral that it would force them into bankruptcy, on the spot. Most of you may not know it but all the mines and even gold industrial players have margin thresholds that, when reached, go up like a rocket. Even ABX has a $600 point that requires massive additional collateral beyond that level. Any short run in the paper gold markets would be almost overnight and go thru $2,000 like butter. In that event, even ABX would not have the collateral to cover it. Remember, below ground valuations are not deliverable in a gold run that demands three day delivery!

The bank's short positions are, as our good poster ORO once pointed out, always hedged in paper positions. If the market ran away, the bank's demands for performance on those positions would crater every arena they function in. Once, again, the banks play the market forces against each other. If, in the course of operation the whole realm of forces are played to zero, the banks just stand aside. I know, of course, that they would be impaired, but the bulk of the blast would be endured by everyone that plays in this marketplace.

The point of my presenting this is that the whole object of the paper gold dynamic is and always was to function for industry hedging habits, not so much to deliver gold to the public. Yet, because this maze was encouraged by the CBs to grow so super large, it's goal was so that political gold could be moved. One day, this entire structure will have served it's useful purpose and then it will be allowed to fail. That day is approaching.

To bring us up to present:
To date, that purpose has been served largely because it succeeded in keeping dollar supporting oil prices down, extending our US economy,,,,, until EMU. As evidence to the process, notice how oil prices began their dollar rise only 6 months into post EMU. Clearly, there was no longer a need to support our dollar economy once the Euro was established. Indeed, just like a turning supertanker takes time, so too does the higher energy prices take time to work their will. Make no mistake, the world has seen the very last of cheap dollar oil. The next dynamic of that process in the transition of oil settlement support into Euro denominations. Notwithstanding Iraq's move as a convenient trial balloon, the mass of this transition will not begin until the US has clearly embarked on a slowdown. And that slowdown, energy induced as it is, will, this time, force the fed to fight it with a super inflationary buyout of anything and everything that defaults. Right down to your shoe laces. This, my friends is the inflation dynamic unleashed once a currency is removed from reserve status.

Further; its no mistake of identification in understanding the ECB / BIS roll in all of this. That the ECB has started cashing in all it's interest on dollar reserves points to a new direction in currency warfare. Our own Randy@ The Tower has documented this for some time. In addition, their marking gold to market is a prerequisite to following the Fed's new inflation stance by scoring the dollar against the Euro gold price once the paper gold markets fail.

Background part 2

Further; its no mistake of identification in understanding the ECB / BIS roll in all of this. That the ECB has started cashing in all it's interest on dollar reserves points to a new direction in currency warfare. Our own Randy@ The Tower has documented this for some time. In addition, their marking gold to market is a prerequisite to following the Fed's new inflation stance by scoring the dollar against the Euro gold price once the paper gold markets fail.

To the point:

However, there were still outstanding gold deliveries on all sides that needed to be addressed, even after EMU. So,,,, around early 1999, the BIS decided to allow the erosion of the paper gold markets to continue to conclusion without fighting it with outright buys.

LeSin's post today (# 47852) about someone noting a BIS offer to take England's gold is to the point. (Hi LeSin, how is your French Sorrel growing? (smile)) That was the last offer before a changed position. They would not do it today. Look at your charts and see where this market the time where gold was finally allowed to drop below $280. It is indeed strange that it hasn't fallen much further.

Where once they stood ready to buy gold outright, in order to stop the wholesale reproduction of contract gold from driving the traded price too low, and degrading the very asset that gave oil producers reason to support the dollar,,,,,,, the market itself would now be allowed to kill itself. All so the final gold contracts could be delivered. That process was evident in the Washington Agreement and the years it would take to complete that workout. (see my Macro below for further explanation)

Where I had seen the WA as a breaking event, Another had long before seen it as an extension of the process that would eventually drive paper gold credibility to Zero. Indeed, he said (posted) that well before WA. As an aside, he always said that all paper would burn. In retrospect, prior to EMU, if it didn't happen, all paper assets were subject to destruction and now I see his point. Post EMU, just gold paper is now in the hearth. He does think EuroLand is the future and I respect that position, greatly!

In my Macro view told in a slightly different way:

We all thought that one day the whole gold system would explode in some huge short covering rally. Indeed, if the Euro failed,,,, producing no EMU, the sudden demand for gold would have driven the paper market sky high until it too broke from financial failure. Making million airs the world over of countless gold owners,,,,, and billionaires of any leveraged player that brought mines, futures or options. Well, maybe billionaires for those that cashed in while the shorts still had money to pay. But,,,,,,,,,,, it never happened. Thank the EMU folks for that.

Now we entered the AD era,,,,, the European Monetary Union (EMU) was a success,,,,, the Euro was formed. This was a political sea (for me also) change regarding gold. It was around spring 1999 (that time again), was when Another made a point I will never forget. It was posted here on the USAGOLD forum. Now that we were in the AD era, the decision was made to let the dollar paper gold market kill itself. We all posted endlessly as to why it could /could not and would /would not happen, but there was one other aspect left out at that time.

As I mentioned above; most of the major gold buyers,,,, the physical gold advocates,,,,,, those that want it as a wealth reserve,,,,,, were gathering physical gold all prior to EMU. Even after EMU, as we worked our way into the early Euro era, gold ownership is intended to bridge the transition away from dollar reserve use. For these nation states and individuals just want gold,,,, not for trading now,,,, nor for use now,,,, and they don't care about it's dollar price now.

We thought that after EMU, dollar paper gold prices would slowly climb as physical demand impacted the paper marketplace. But the problem with that is that such a climb will destroy the ability of the BBs to function and complete that portion of contracts that require delivery. Remember, we now have countless major Euro players waiting for gold deliveries from mines and other contracted sources. Overall a small portion yet, all within the trading noise of this huge arena. Yet, this gold is a major part of the Euro system of the future as it will be a replacement asset for nation states that stand outside the Zone but will trade within it. (as a contrast to Britain that will join)

From the time of the Washington Agreement until it's end (three years left out of four+/-),,,,, the dollar paper gold world will be allowed to do the equivalent of a currency inflation. No nation or government CB will now stand in the way. You see, the only way the physical deliveries can be completed is for the market place to have it's way. In doing so, by continuing to short the market in a piling on stance, liquidity will remain for delivery. Remember, the gold recipients do not care what the dollar paper price is at delivery, only that their gold buys can be completed. And for that to happen, the BBs must have an ever lower price. Hence the contradictory nature of the major ECB bank, regarding gold.

Yet, the real message must not be lost. Between now and then (perhaps tomorrow or in a year or so), physical gold will embark upon it's own road. A GoldTrail if you will. A drama seldom witnessed ever, much less seen in our time. I state flatly and for the record that the premium paid on the purchase of physical gold will climb through the roof in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. Between us Physical Gold Advocates, we will know it's but a reflection of the free market to come and a true account of where it's value really stands. For the paper trader, it will become the curse of lost wealth.

This, my friends is the face of a failing paper gold market. A market that evolved far beyond what it originally was used for. A "New Gold Market" built for the support of a currency's ending timeline and allowed to die of it's own misconception.

From here we can see the "advantage" of physical purchased for an unknown value. Gold held as the ancients held it.

No denomination necessary until it is allowed to trade,,,, "Free" once again!

Then our journey will be done. Then our wealth will be complete.

"We watch this new gold market together, yes?"

Thank you all for your time

Winter Thoughts on Another Thoughts

-----------

Hello Michael,

Thanks for taking some Saturday time to digest our subject. It is all consuming, isn't it? I think it's obvious to anyone reading it (background post on TrailsPage) that the post is structured in "rough draft form". I started to define it into a real publication and realized such a work would quickly grow to over 20 pages (smile). Later, I stopped and just posted the general thought outline. Besides, defining today's modern events is a job for each individual reader that comes here and is what I truly hope they will accomplish. My hope is that the play we are all viewing is engaging enough to draw people to think, as Another so wanted everyone to do.

For yourself, Michael, I see you had absolutely no problem defining your thoughts as your post above clearly described. By the way, try to read Mr. Roger Cohen's piece on the NY Times News Service link above. Titled; Europe's Shifting Role Poses Challenge to U.S.,,,,, excellent conclusions
and he's just a step or two behind your steps. I can see him in your dust on that blazing trail. (grin))

I think one of the most difficult understandings for all of us to grasp lies in perceiving the rising value of physical gold while the dollar world around us keeps telling a different tail. People that pay the cash price today, for the advantage of having gold, then sell that gold into a falling paper marketplace are doing no different than the mines do. That is selling hard reserves into Another's
pocket and doing it for almost a free price. Losing the very same wealth that the paper goldbugs lose as they, in parallel, move in and out of paper contracts. All in a vain attempt to circumvent the effects of a dying dollar gold market.

In doing this they are just playing the same trading game Western investors have been conditioned to do so very well. In the process they will end up with impaired balance sheets when they need real assets the most; when this currency / political transition breaks into the open. In your piece on
the News & Views page, you outline the sad nature of a gold industry being taken to the cleaners because their inability to step away and consider what is being done to them. Absolutely correct perception and well structured thought!

Yet, in retrospect, this is a common problem in any business that's in operation to make a paper profit, isn't it? The trouble, in our gold arena, is in how investors have been lead to perceive gold mines as personal gold reserves. But someone forgot to tell them that these entities must function or die. And for a mine to function they must sell gold into the same currency market that is used to price their equity.

I guess people didn't "think hard enough or long enough" about how that would work if the vast metal contract markets grew so large that trading the contract superseded the validity of receiving the mine's product (gold). In other words, as paper supply grew, paper prices fell and most holders simply took their losses as they dumped the paper holdings. Never taking delivery because they didn't want it and even, at times, running from it! All in a perfectly legal use of the system as it is structured. Such performance leaves open an easy door for non-hard money traders to make a "business man's profit" by exploiting said dynamic. Of course this trend was encouraged by the CBs. But, that encouragement or conspiracy as some call it, is no different than a governments encouragement of turning the Arizona desert into a playground with water. Ha! Ha! It's all in how we see and feel the effects, isn't it?

Investors forgot that only a few short years ago, a world currency was treated in the exact same manner as our contract gold markets today. Randy, ORO, yourself and many others all understand this well. The dollar was over printed and traded until everyone simply traded it's price (exchange
rate) and no one was taking enough gold delivery to shut the system down. Same dynamic, as you so well know, my friend.

Back then, just as today, paper gold, those paper dollars as they were called, became the denominator of gold's value without the discipline of a physical exchange to right the misconception. We all know the results and it's eventual consequences. Perhaps the beginnings of today's final death march into the sunset of our currency. A Timeline end, so to speak.

Today, miners sell their product for a cash price because that was the "business plan" they signed up for and it included using this paper pricing system. No one would squawk one bit at how wrong it all is if gold was at $500! Yet, the same logic to end the terrible practice would still exist. I wonder if Criss Powell could address that segment for us? It does need discussion if only a supposition, right?

Further, I suspect their actions, GATA may be opening a can of worms that could accelerate the very process I have been describing. Quickly cutting off the avenue for many to escape the paper strangle hold?

One more thought for everyone:

If mines had charted their companies to sell the product outright and retail, the problem would not have changed because we all would still trade their product (gold) at the contract paper price. Trying not to own the metal, just trade the price, no?

------------

Back to your thoughts, MK,

The only near term hope for gold is in a restructuring of gold trade, worldwide. Thank goodness we are at the end of the end and entering that beginning! The political process that's now on trend is doing just that. In every political motivation, found in the Old World, the need for physical gold to be valued in modern life terms is evident. Yet, this completely conflicts with every Western agenda that demands gold remain within it's perceived dollar commodity price band. Ironically, if the West were to somehow win, leveraged gold bugs would make only inflation adjusted gains. Something in their view that would be just fine. Indeed, the very system they deplore would pay them their due.
Conversely, if the Euro faction wins, Physical Gold Advocates would enjoy outsized real gains along with future dollar inflation gains. Fortunately, for Gold Advocates, physical gold will win the day anyway. Not because we are playing a world game, but because the natural laws of physics are ending the dollar's time.

As we look down this path, I see nothing but a one-way trend as gold traders are cleaned and gutted by their own desire to play leverage in the very paper market that's being restructured. To this end Western Thinking will morph (that word again) into a new understanding of what is real and what is not. For most, that education will require a big price before it's completed. But then again, just look at the cost of many years in college? Perhaps learning is always expensive? (big smile)

Thank you, my friend and everyone for reading
Yes, Wintering well.

An Evolving Europe Raises U.S.-NATO Anxiety

Salmon, the writer of that Bloomberg article is not correct when he says, "Harmony Gold Mining Co., South Africa's third-largest gold producer, said on Tuesday that it secured an option to sell 1 million ounces of borrowed metal." Harmony bought options but not for "borrowed" gold.-----

Hi R. Powell,
The problem with their structure of the deal is that if gold falls below $260, to $240 for instance,,, their banks would force them to borrow at the new $240 range and spot the gold onto the physical market. The paper market is not concerned with their mining new gold to sell into this option over
time,,,,,,, it's their precedent to almost every other miner to exercize their position with existing gold as the paper created price falls. Further breaking the system.

Again, whether or not this much gold can be borrowed today or not makes little difference. Once the paper sellers start piling on with naked positions on the otc, these mines will be forced to use their options. This is just another example of non-hard money players using existing paper market
structure to limit their cash risk. They don't care about gold, the market or the metal, they are just following the leader.

All of this is leading to a complete breakdown in the entire pricing system. We watch and learn.

Hi Lamprey,

The bank has the prerogative of cash settlement with these options, for the premium alone, or reorganize that portion of the financing into a gold loan,,,,, using the put as part of a physical deal. It all depends on whether the actual lender (whoever that may be (smile) is seeking immediate gold or not. Yes, the put writer may just function on the side with a cash settlement, completely outside the
physical play, to his favor or not, depending on the price. And physical gold may or may not be forced into the play. This is the problem that has overhung the whole paper market for a long time.

All through out this period, no one knows when someone is going to forces real gold to move. Usually, when it does, it's because a need exists in someone's portfolio and that need requires existing material. Not mined gold over time.

Harmony hedge
-------------

Rich, we still are on different channels. Let me take another poke at it (smile). From your post:

----Trail Guide, whether or not the one time cost (premium) of the put options is included in the loan is irrelevant.---

Ok, I completely and totally agree with that item. The premium that H paid to buy the option contract came out of their pocket and has no place in the context of this. Whether they get the premium money back or lose it all means nothing to this discussion. next:

---------The loan was for mining expansion.------------

Ok, the bank gave them a bunch of cash to spend on infrastructure. As H makes money from their business plan they will pay back this loan. next:

--------The bank was worried that Harmony wouldn't be able to repay IF POG sank lower SO the bank required some insurance of the Harmony's ability to repay. ------------ Harmony bought the right to sell gold at a future date at a set price. They own this right, it is NOT an obligation.
-----------

Ok again!
However, before they sign on the dotted line, H buys an insurance option so the bank can be covered. True, in standard nomenclature an option,,,, "in and of itself" and "standing by itself" is but a right to do something, not an obligation. BUT, H does have an obligation to perform on their loan AND this option is tied to that performance. In contract law, that obligation on the loan is passed thru into and upon this insurance collateral called a put option. Therefore, because that option performance was made in conjuncture with the loan, H will be required to use it ""as the bank directs"" --IF-- their business function is impaired by a gold price so low that they cannot conduct
ALL their business in a reasonable profitable manner. next:

----------If you buy an option to buy a piece of land at a set price for a length of time, youhave the right BUT NOT the obligation to buy. ------------

Absolutely! next

--------- Harmony can sell gold at a future date for a set price. If POG is higher than that set price at that future date, Harmony will get the higher price.-------------

Rich,
Harmony can do what ever they want with this option contract AS LONG as it does not infringe upon the collateral the bank used to make the loan. But, you see, that option is part of the loan collateral. This option, this contract right to do something is part of what the bank claims as an asset
against the loan. If the price of gold went to $200, as an extreme example, the bank may not allow H to just sell the option for a cash profit. The bank also has several implied "RIGHTS" within the loan agreement on how to make the best use of "collateral assets" in a default situation.

We, as outsiders may not make assumptions as to what liabilities the bank incurred to supply the cash for this loan. The assets that originated this transaction, that is, "where the cash came from", may want themselves taken completely out of the deal if gold was to tumble. Or they may want physical gold outright? Or the bank may want to simply retreat also. So,,,,, in the event of Harmony being financially impaired from a too low gold price, the bank may seize the option, borrow physical gold at the then much lower price and sell said gold into that option's higher price. Then simply hold this new cash in an interest bearing account that would pay the low borrow rate on the gold loan. Still, H would be on the hook because their assets, gold in the ground that was already attached for the cash loan, would be attached to eventually pay off the new gold loan. No, if prices remained too low and H could still not operate, then the gold loan would just sit there and roll over and over.

This may or may not be the case for them, and I am just explaining how some of these things work. But it is a very common structure today. next:

----They did not sell forward, they are not "locked in" or obligated to sell at all, at any price.---

True, I never for a moment thought that they sold forward.

But they are locked into a cash loan obligation and that contract's credibility depends on the bank's ability to use several methods to remedy a future situation. Sure, if we freeze the moment and all prices stay the same, their contract is static and everything is fine, just as is any other contract in such a situation. But, any and all loans are dynamic, my friend. Ha! Ha!, ask any banker? What you
can and cannot do is subject to future circumstances. next:

---- If they do want to sell, they have assured themselves a minimum sale price. Futures sales = obligations ------

As long as they are up to date, and have permission to liquidate loan collateral, yes. next:

-----Options may or may not be exercised.------

If your option is not part of a loan obligation and held as collateral, this is true. next:

------Many of the complaints (forward sales) against the paper gold market are valid, this one does not hurt POG and seems misunderstood.----------

I don't think any big players are confused about this. Perhaps the investing / trading crowd may not grasp it fully? It's the possibility that all these paper hedges may be forced to crowd into the forward sales area that shakes the market dynamics. Further, it's all together possible that naked shorting and carry trading could overwhelm the paper supply and force paper prices into a future lower price range. Staying on such a trend, paper gold could lose all credibility to perform as a proxy for physical gold! Eventually trading at a discount. All because every long holder that's in the game for paper trades only, is trying to unload because of all this new supply. This is why I said a long, long time ago that at the end of all of this we may see a colossal spike in comex futures OI (400,000 1,000,000 contracts) as everyone tries to cover their cash risk. Caring nothing about who is , can or wants to take delivery. Long before this begins, the premium on physical gold will
start a vertical rise the likes we have never seen! (smile) We shall see.

That's my take on it, my friend

SHifty, I have your post now, but am trying to keep these two Grizzlys from eating me up. Be with you as soon as able.(grin)

----------------
OK, John Doe and R. Powell, now we are diving in (smile).

I want to flatly state that all of what I have been talking about here is using Harmony as an illustration. They may or may not be in the situation described. Even though I don't own them, they are a good gold company. Out of a trillion bad ones.

Rich,
I may have to take your posts a little out of sink to address each item, but will try to stay in order. You said in R Powell (2/12/2001; 14:58:56MT - usagold.com msg#: 48109):

------ However, if POG does fall, H can still sell gold at $250/ounce- a price that (the bank is satisfied) will keep H in business and repay the loan. Answer to your question, Harmony will exercise its option to sell at $250 if POG is lower than $250 but is not forced to.-------

Now,,,,,,, we need to think about this a little bit? On one hand we say that H does not have the obligation to use their puts, only the right if they choose to do so. But, on the other hand, if the price of gold falls below $250, they would not be forced to sell into those puts? My friend, that begs the question; "if their loan package is built on the presumption that they must have $250 or better to make their payments, who would they sell their production to if the world paper price is below that"? Will the bank let them just hold the puts and sell into a lower world price? That's right, they won't. It's not a question of them being forced to sell into those puts, they "WILL" sell into those puts. And the bank will make sure of it. Below $250, H has no choice and the obligation stems from the loan structure itself. As I stated below, the loan itself implies that the puts are collateral and controlled by the loan covenants below $250. next:

-------The seller of the option holds liability for its exercise, the buyer (holder, Harmony) of the option has no obligations, just the choice of whether or not to exercise the option.------

Even though you understand the function, I think you are somewhat out of context and seeing these puts as being entered into more as a business speculation by H. These contracts are collateral against the loan and carry an obligation of use below $250 in order to season the loan further. Again, as I said above and below in #48106, H will use these puts under these conditions, as they will have no choice. next:

-----------The banks have no control over Harmony's business- they can foreclose on the note if H does not make the payments but- just accepting a business loan does not give the bank control over how you run your business-----------

Rich, how did you come to the conclusion that these puts are part of H's business? They did not own them and didn't want them prior to the loan. As the article in Barrons (and their own statements) make clear; they were forced to make these part of the loan structure as collateral. Once again, below $250, the conducting of H's business has no bearing on whether these contracts are used. The loan requirements will make them use it even if they somehow didn't want to. I hope
we have at least established that these puts assets are bank collateral and cannot be harmed. Yes? next:

----------If POG is less than $250, Harmony also has the choice of selling gold (at that option price) or selling the option which amounts to a cash settlement (no physical involved). Either way, H has insured that it will be able to repay its loan. Trail guide, If the puts for $1 million ounces of gold sales (or cash offsets) generates enough money to make the loan payments, then the banks would have no further interest in marking to market gold in the ground or anything else at Harmony.-------

Rich, this is where a lot of us investors go off on the deep end if we are not careful. Myself very much included. (smile) I think you know that these loans are made based on the performance of the entire company, not just the one little segment they finance.

Sure, H could sell gold into these puts or cash them out as needed to cover their usual expense,,, then out of profits make the loan payments. But in order to do that they must still mine gold and that requires all ongoing operations to at least break even.

I point back to the context of my earlier post. We, as industry players are concerned of a sudden fall of gold to say $200. As my example below used. At that point, H, as a viable operation in it total would be impaired. Yes, that one loan could be covered if they run just that one segment of their business and sold into these $250 puts. But, no lender will carry such a loan. If they originated the loan with limited liability, they still must act prudentially.

They will not let H simply eat up that put to keep them going. Just because the loan is being serviced, doesn't blind the lender to the fact that his total collateral assets are being impaired. You can't park your brand new ford pickup in the ocean, up to it's engine, and still expect the bank collectors not to come for it? Even if you are making payments!(smile)

Because that put is collateral, it is subject to seizure and use to not just pay the loan but close it out. In the case of many of these mines, the sale of the hedge securities, Harmony's puts in this example, would not cash out the loan. It's not enough. That could only happen by the lender borrowing gold and selling it into the put. Then they would have full cash with a very small or almost no payment
liability. Sure, they would oue gold. But, that trade off would stick as an attachment to H's unmined assets until something happens??? Don't think for a min. that their reserves are not totally involved in a loan with gold at these current levels. next:

R Powell (2/12/2001; 15:29:48MT - usagold.com msg#: 48111)

-------- The bank expects repayment of the loan but (unless the bank owns the puts!) the bank can not force business decisions involving the puts. The bank can foreclose on a business for non-payment but they can't force business decisions on a company just because a loan exists.-----

Once again, Rich, it's the old "pick up truck in the water" analogy. I guess, in a way you are right. If you lent someone $25K to buy a pick up and he left it in the ocean one month later,,,,,,but kept making payments,,,,,,, you couldn't force him to make a reasonable decision,,,,,, and place the truck in safety. Yes, it is his business to run. But, somehow, someway, I bet you as the lender would try to take control of the way that truck was being used. I think laws concerning collateral assets give lenders (yourself in this case) the ability to grab their collateral! And even allow then to use it in a way that covers their exposure. Boy, in my past life I must have been through this before
because I just know I'm right,,,,, (grin).

My guess is that you would try your best to remove yourself from "salt water truck ownership" and get as much of your money out from behind that collateral as possible. Just as the lending banks would do in H's case,,,,,,if gold fell to $200. You see, the whole darn truck is worthless at $200,,, I mean with all that salt water and seaweed! (smile) next:

R Powell (2/12/2001; 15:49:13MT - usagold.com msg#: 48112)

------Agreed. If I have payments due on a new truck, the bank wants it well taken care of (and not sold) unless the bank is paid-in-full. As the purchase of the options were conditional to obtaining the loan, their well being (even though they are time wasting assetts) is a concern of both lender andborrower. Harmony has also obligated itself to performing as profitable enough to repay the loan which it will do by conducting its business which is gold mining.-----------

Well sir,,,,,, My whole thrust has been regarding what the impact would be on the total marketplace if gold fell into a very low range. H is just our example. Your point leaves out several things. They cannot conduct a profitable business of gold mining if the price falls too far. If they begin using these put profits to fund the entire operation, the collateral behind the loan is degrading just as a truck would do in salt water.

They (H) purchased these options as part of the loan package not "next to" their loan package and these puts became collateral "within" that package. The loan officer (lender) will seize that truck (put options) and sell it (cash out the put) to cover the loan. If that action does not cover the loan, then he will drive the truck personally (sell borrowed gold into the put) until his lost asset is
recovered as best as able.

Rich, you have misconstrued my point. Under certain circumstances, to low a gold price, the lender will be the one borrowing gold and dumping it into the put,,,,,, not H. Yet, the degradation of H would be just the same. next:

John Doe (2/12/2001; 16:05:50MT - usagold.com msg#: 48113)

Hello John,

------- @ Trail Guide
The only way Harmony's put deal could drive gold down is if the originator of the put (whoever that is) bothers to hedge its exposure to the put by borrowing and selling (i.e., a direct physical short)some or all of the gold covered in the contract. As the normal course in these types of common
derivatives is to maintain a continuous delta hedge, perhaps some small amount of the total 1 million ounces has already been shorted and more would be added as the price falls (if it falls).-------

OK, I could live with that position(smile) next:

------As the originator's hedging away of the risk of selling the put to Harmony can be carried out in the futures market without any physical involvement whatsoever, even the sale of physical is notassured, though one could assume, though a chain of trades offsetting the futures, that eventually, someone, somewhere, will sell enough physical gold to maintain a "valid" hedge. As some principal
somewhere is likely "good" for naked shorting, even a terminating physical sale is not necessarily
assured.--------

Again, I'm with ya! next:

---------- Harmony, is, at worst, only driving the gold price down indirectly, if at all, and then only to the extent that its put purchase is being delta hedged by its counterparty, if at all. ------------

John, all of what you present is how it's usually set up. It's after the clock starts that the real action begins. I posted earlier that:

""" True, I never for a moment thought that they sold forward. But they are locked into a cash loan obligation and that contract's credibility depends on the bank's ability to use several methods to remedy a future situation. Sure, if we freeze the moment and all prices stay the same, their contract is static and everything is fine, just as is any other contract in such a situation. But, any and all loans
are dynamic, my friend. Ha! Ha!, ask any banker? What you can and cannot do is subject to future circumstances.""""

That "future situation" I speak of is a quickly falling gold price. Falling well below most everyone's ability to function. If gold falls, it's not just H that is in the "salt water", the whole industry is and all these paper hedges will be seized long before the companies can use them to hang on with. This is when the system really implodes as every bank with a contract (read that salty truck) will be trying to remove their money from the entire sector. Not just make the loan payments. To do this, they will sell borrowed physical until it's supply is gone,,,,,, even at a very high rate. All this supply coupled with everyone unloading long paper positions that can no longer be credible,,,,, will crash the gold market!

This, is a very crude micro explanation of how and why any amount of further hedging is giving the sector the shakes. It's far worse than you think.

On that happy note, I'm done for a while

Trail Guide/FOA: I am a small placer miner and own physical gold ( in most all forms) and also un-hedged mining company shares in equal amounts. I have a problem understanding how Gold will have a tremendous value and that this will not also be the case with un-hedged mining companies that produce the very substance that you say will be so valuable.If we hold physical gold in a safe place to be pulled out for use when needed , what makes the gold I hold better than the gold that will be poured into a bar on the same day in the future? Will it not have equal value in whatever is being used as the medium of exchange . I can see where physical may out perform shares ,and I also can see where hedged mines can go bust , but I must be missing something here. Are you saying that mining will be outlawed in the future? Or will it be performed only by a world
government of some sort and all the people that own the mines can kiss their wazoo? I hope when time permits that you can shed some light on this for me.
================

OK, shifty, you write:

------Or will it be performed only by a world government of some sort and all the people that own the mines can kiss their wazoo?.------

For the record, I never have even for a moment considered some one world government. I also laugh at the notion of some great Cabal running the show. These shallow statements are the dream work of people that confuse social order with someone controlling their lives. Our world history is full of rules and laws enacted by various factions from the beginning. Face it, laws always infringe on some group as they yell big brother! We will never be without some segment being controlled for the society at large! It always the easy way out. Broadcast that some small bunch is profiting by ruling over us.

For better or worse this is the way human kind has governed itself. During some time frames it's real bad and in others it's real good. We slide from one side of the bank to the other as everyone rides this river of life. But never has any one group been smart enough or powerful enough to
control us all. And never will be. It's a waste of of our short lives to base our decisions on when the all powerful Guru will take us over.

-------Are you saying that mining will be outlawed in the future?------

Shifty, did you really mean to ask that? After all the countless references to taxes, production controls,,,,, the precedent of the Texas Railroad Commission,,,,,,, the reasoning for governments to write legal tender laws and their ability to implement them,,,,,, the recent control of California power distribution?,,,, the foundation of a changing reserve currency system,,,,, In all this you ask
in the context of something done outside the law?

Is your income being taken as an outlaw act, because it's taxed? Is the speed limit range an outlaw rule because it 35 mph? Is the dumping of sewerage in the Mississippi an outlaw act, or should the law be changed to stop infringing on the free rights of some? Do you see the rules that control
someone else's assets as good because it benefits your cause? Do you think rules are bad if they suddenly impact your investment assets?

If gold production is limited, and the amount produced controlled by law. Would this be an outlaw of mining or the better use of a limited resource? Any number of controls could be implemented and they would certainly impact some. Yourself? You will then be one of the ones that's being ruled by the mass, right? So you can't dump all the waste in the river you feel you should be able to? You can't drive as fast as you feel you should be able? You can't take as much money home because the IRS takes more than you think they should? So gold production is limited and said production
is taxes in some controlling way? So what's new in the world?

Remember, in the 1800s there was no income tax,,,,, at all? People back then said the same thing you do now,,,,,,, "What now, is making money being outlawed?

Shifty, the world moves on whether we want to be on the ride or not. Fight it if you will or adjust yourself. I'm also in the boat and just navigating the rock in the river. Watch your Bow, my friend, rapids dead ahead! (smile)

John, when discussions get this long and in debth, we must be more exact in our reference,,,,, or one cannot reply effectively. Your words:

-----I continue to see inferences that Harmony would have to "sell into the market" if the put goes into the money.------

Where do you see this and how did my context infer this?

-------- If the market is below the strike price, the gold that Harmony normally mines will simply be "put" the originator of the contract at or perhaps sometime before expiration, and not "sold into the market".------

Did I not place all my proposition within a category of gold dropping quickly into the $200 range,,,, as an example?

-------- I sense you are trying to fit Harmony's recent financing into a contributory role in the process whereby the paper-gold markets are predicted to freeze and/or collapse.--------

Absolutely, but within a framework of the entire industry suffering the same fate. That future problem is the source of the jitters the market feels when each new hedge is applied. How did you read my post to reference otherwise? The total thrust of the post was in this direction, no?

Chris Powell (2/11/2001; 12:32:20MT - usagold.com msg#: 48009) Is GATA cutting off paper gold's escape? (Corrected version)

-----------------

Hi Chris,
Thanks for clarifying your position. I fully well understand where GATA is going with their efforts.

Anyone that has invested in the gold industry during the 90s has had a real negative impact on their wealth. If one used the past decades as a precedent for rules , typical equity valuations or laws of conduct within this arena, their assets should not have suffered as they have. Cycles of highs and lows were expected, but a complete washout of product (gold) value was never in the cards. Did someone change the rules or were the rules just never fully understood?

My position is that the rules didn't change and the system is functioning within it's range. What did happen is that investors never owned these securities during such a period. Therefore, they never had a chance to experience how they would react outside the perceived fair pricing band.

This commodities pricing band, that gold is conjectured to belong in, was never forced outside it's fair value perimeter until this decade. Allowing for past inflation calculations. Reading what Mr. Parks wrote the other day in

"It's Not Your Daddy's Gold Anymore --- by Lawrence Parks" (see my 2/9/2001#: 47878 for ref.),

we can get an idea of how it all happened. Without an investment need on the horizon, western gold demand fell back into an industrial mode with jewelry being the
greatest portion of that segment. Further, the selling of existing gold savings, no longer seen as real wealth, added to the supply.

From my location, I could see where the common paper pricing of gold that was used through out most of our modern times had never functioned without a backdrop of bullion accumulation by the Western masses. Once this liquidation trend was in place, anyone from the shoe boy to the CB
could simply sell contracts as part of the crowd and no one would argue. With everyone now betting on gold's price moves without wanting the metal, paper gold could be traded with very little ownership demand for metal. The volume of this particular type of trading could and did completely
overwhelm the physical segment of the markets. Sold over and over, then brought back from a disgruntled "trading public" at a lower price. "Someone is after us", was the cry! Yes indeed, it was us!

Actually the proof is in the air, all around us, and your position, Chris, bears this out. Taking a line from Mr. Parks, ""It's Not Your Daddy's Gold Anymore", paper traders do not endorse the physical advocate's side of the equation. For us advocates, gold at even a dollar is a good thing.
Where as gold below the mine production range is a negative manipulation of the system for long paper traders. Again, had gold risen to $600 because the Governments, the traders, the players, the banks and all, jumped into long paper,,,,, not a word would have been said. Yet, the physical gold buyers of the world would have had to pay dearly for their new savings.

Chris, your comment saying:

----"But what are we at GATA to do? It didn't seem enough for us to sit back and let nature take its course----"

This intrigued me. You know, you could have said great day for gold, lets all buy the metal and not add any more to our industry investments! If the Cabal wants to use their illegal operations to drive gold into the dirt,,,,, bring it on, yes? You know, no industry ever went broke from people buying it's main product,,,, in mass! It's funny how the industry investors always try to remedy the same dynamic by asking the mines to slow down. Yet, this is something they all fear that new government controls on production would do???? But, jumping to the physical side of the fence is never an option?

Yes, promoting the metal, buying the product, would eventually cut off the paper selling far easier and faster than any legal action. Bill Gates didn't get where he is at by telling everyone that his company shares were a far better thing for the public to buy than his software???? (smile)

You say:

------- Governments and mining companies have responsibilities beyond themselves --governments to the public, mining companies to their shareholders and employees and even,especially in mining-dependent areas, to their countries as well. -----------

True, but these are still businesses, not one's personal reserves. When we "Western Children" told everyone that would listen to stop buying their main product (gold) and buy near product substitutions,,,, what does one expect to happen? Then we blame the government for exploiting the issue and the mines for falling into the hands of manipulators that offer them the only way to stay in business,,,, sell forward.

Just because all this happened to fall in a time period where currency issues are impacting the problem doesn't negate these faults of thought in the industry,,,,, or it's dogmatic promoters. Had gold product been promoted, it's physical demand could have easily overridden any political
motivations,,,,,, hands down. We chose to bet on a lame horse and now want satisfaction because that animal is under an attack it cannot overcome. Physical gold today, even allowing for it's incorrect currency valuations proves that it's the better defense during strange times.

You say:

-----FOA/Trail Guide is right that GATA may accelerate the breakdown of the manipulated paper gold market -- that indeed is our charter, exactly what we set out to do. If GATA helps "cut off the avenue of escape" from the paper gold market, so be it. -----

Why did you not see the physical side of this? My friend, I was referring to the escape from all paper substitutes and the escapees being from all walks of life. Not just the big BBs or trader types. Truly, what you fear is what we embrace; that gold will fall further while physical supplies
last.

I perceive that your actions will accelerate a breakdown in this paper market and that breakdown will not shut down the market. No, it will leave the system mired in legal moralizes while the premium on physical gold spikes well above the paper trading price. Leaving both the gold
advocate and gold substitute bug no avenue of escape.

The longer the physical markets can operate next to a rapidly inflating paper market, the better it will be for gold buyers.

You say:

-----Gold IS special, but the kind of trading that distresses FOA/Trail Guide -- the trading in gold's mere price, as opposed to trading in the metal itself -- is hardly unique. Most markets trade this way, commodities and currencies. Speculators pile on for the ride whatever is being traded. As long as there will be trading in gold, there will be speculation. ----------The difference with gold is that its being more than a commodity -- its being a universal currency in itself, -------

As I said, had the price of gold stayed within a $400 to $600 range, the present system would not be opposed one bit. It would even be suggested that gold is performing it's historic roll of documenting currency inflation. Even though such inflation would be well beyond the commodity price of gold. All is well as leverage players use the very same system to profit themselves at a level equal to the real inflation rate. And doing said profiting as both big boys and small operators alike. Leaving the much larger world public no place to gain an equal share by owing real gold.
We indeed, as Mr. Park's children, stand in a mirror and do not see ourselves draped in Western thought and wearing new world ideals about old world wealth.

"Free markets", the paper traders claim, siting on both sides of the fence. "Free Markets are what we seek, as long as they trade our way".

Exhausted
------ After several years of analyzing, buying, holding, hoping, and reading this forum, I am cutting back on precious metal positions. ------- cash has not been trash, even when it comes to PM stocks. ---------

You are not kidding, "rasp",,,,, everyone is learning the difference between trading a "precious metal position" and owning real gold for it's "advantage" over currency! Cash and real gold are not trash in today's world and never have been. It's just that over the last few decades "physical gold advocates" got morphed into the same basket "gold bugs" were in. The media projected that being a gold bug meant trading gold stock options, gold options, gold stocks, gold futures, gold options on futures, unallocated gold certificates at banks and even delving into leveraged gold contracts at some back coast gold dealers acting like coin shops! Did I leave anything out, there must be others?

Just as soon as all this garbage sank faster than the real thing, the media jumped in and said owning gold is a real bummer. They say this after decades of telling us that a "gold position" and "physical gold ownership" were one in the same. Is it no wonder the public talks about it all in the same context. You have to ask yourself:

----"The Western View, were you born with it or did you have to learn it?"------

I know where Gata is going with their line of attack and I support them for it. There are some bad guys out there that are going to be eaten alive when the GATA pressure is high enough. But, I think we have to allow that a little part of my conclusions are what Chris was pointing to when he said;
that people got sold a position in racket. Even if my purpose is outside their thrust, my logic can mean everything in building a new gold advocate's understanding. (Hello Sir Chris, thanks for thr reply. I'll be talking with you in a bit.) .

From his post of: Chris Powell (2/13/2001; 21:20:26MT - usagold.com msg#: 48208)

-------------
"We may agree that real metal is better than paper. (I hope we agree that the generous proprietor of this forum is an excellent source of the former.) We may even deride those who have found themselves on the wrong end of speculation in gold paper. Certainly GATA has done as much as anyone to expose and explain the gold derivatives racket.

But then what of people who invested honestly both in gold paper and in mining companies under the misapprehension that the ordinary rules would be followed and that there was a free market in gold, the free market that their governments told them there was?"

Note: please real all of his post.
------------

Well people, all the "gold positions" I mentioned above are, indeed included in those very same derivatives he speaks of! Sure, "Gold Bugs" speculate on them, make and lose big money. But, most conservative "Gold Advocates" never consider them as the place where one buys gold?

When someone invests honestly in gold paper, in Chris's context, they have to follow all the rules as they stand. This includes accepting that our physical laws are part of and form our very trading assumptions. Not thinking, investors apply half the logic, trading just the price of something, expecting our real physical laws to apply anyway. They won't, on their own, unless you make them apply to your position, by taking delivery.

Trading the price alone from the long side can work, but getting away with it only happens when we are in a certain "historic price band". That past price precedent has made us think we were following the rules and succeeding. This classic, mental omission has been the source of untold
loses, brought upon ourselves as we try to play half the game,,,, all the time. Today, as we leave the comfort of those "safe price ranges", the dynamics and the nature of all this is exposed as two separate markets.

Basic investing rules include selling out any long position if supply is created faster than demand. The paper half of this gold market is in such a situation. Unless you plan on bridging the two markets by taking delivery, you are buying the wrong side of the gold dynamic. Whether we like it or not, even though real gold supply is in deficit to it's demand, paper supply is way more than it's demand. When the price ranges left their "commodities range" it created this new divergence. Almost like saying "it's a new gold market, yes"?

Again, this is a real world we live in and real world physical laws are what makes the trading rules work. In that real world, if someone is "honestly" long to get gold in the paper market, then stepping up to the bar and taking delivery would be the "honest move"? If not, I say again, he is playing the wrong market, and paying for it. Because the paper supply / demand dynamic is against him. The officials didn't change the rules on this portion, we brought it on our selves.

Exercising one's contract position for real goods, even if if the price drops, changes the dynamics of supply and demand for the actual metal. And does so in line with whatever the paper supply is. If the demand for paper is made to be equal to demand for real metal, then noone could sell more fake paper than the gold that exists! It's that simple of a physical law. In this state, there could have
been no "dishonest markets" as our perception proclaims. We would have owned it all! You guys are with me on this, right?

Let's face it, Western Gold Bugs played a part in this political game because their investing habits led them there. International currency trading do include gold values, no matter what London says and it truly is His Majesty's "lion's den". Had we all stayed conservative, and physical, the government forces would have been forced into another form of a 1971 gold window closing long before now!

Paper Gold Bugs take on a gold position and "play like" they (and everyone else also) will demand delivery if it drops. This is the source of the silly notion people get when they watch OI. They stick their chest out and say; "boy, us and them are going to squeeze this market with delivery demands if the price keeps falling"!--- "Looking around the room for others to agree with them as they talk"!--- then the price just keeps falling.

Yea right, they can just afford the margin and are scared stiff that they may have to post more,,,, And they are going to go 100% AND PAY UP?? ,,,,, yea right! You say Gold Bugs and Gold Advocates are one in the same? No, there is a big difference, my friend. Cunning Gold Advocates take the Gold Bug's margin money then turns around and buys physical gold with it. Awful bunch of people. Nice, GA's are safer and never get involved in the whole process. They just buy gold for it's advantage and wait out the serious wealth that's coming.

So, when the price drops, paper Gold Position players run away and say it was just a game of hid and seek, after all. "But, we'll be back!", is their yell,,,,, looking over their shoulder at a full gallop. Ha! Ha! They were just trend followers, after all. I have to return to using my earlier reference to Park's post and then say,,,,," the children just want to play a game",,,, and cry when they lose. You
want to hear how the big boys think? Close your ears, because it ain't nice.

---The governments are all going to let this thing die just like the 71 dollar with it's gold backing. They are not going to kill it by declaring worldwide position limits or 100% margin. They would look too dirty if they did. So, when guys like us (gold advocates) see the action, we take a bite.

We buy all the physical the market will offer us at ever lower prices and sell the hell out of "gold positions". It's happening the world over! Knowing full well that the boys ("Gold Bugs") will run from delivery. Hey, why not? At least half the equation is politically correct for today's era. The trading era, that is! Besides, people go to Vegas, dumping more money than the paper gold crowd, ever will. All the while knowing full well that there is no payoff. Atlantic City is just as full of gamblers and they are not asset players either,,,, just want to spin the wheel for fun, like these paper Bugs". Hey, we are the good guys in all this,,,, at least we are buying the mine's product,,,
gold. We aren't killing anyone's job,,,, the paper bugs are by supporting the system with their buys and never taking any product!!!! -------

Ouch, that hurt! The truth has a mild sting sometimes.

OK, once again, the market place will follow this trend of inflating world "gold positions" because people keep buying those paper positions. How does it go?? A trend in motion goes to conclusion? If there is one thing we have learned in this world; if there is a demand, someone will give it supply. (smile)

As long as it's just paper on margin we want, they got plenty to sell. Now, if anyone starts shifting their buying habits away from paper, this game will end. But don't worry about that because everyone is waiting for someone else to start that trend. You see, it's just like a business cycle, the supply will build until demand falls away or the whole infrastructure disintegrates. I'm betting that the market itself will fail.

One more thing, "Rasp", there is nothing wrong with owning mines. But we have to understand that their trading stock price is based on a never ending supply of paper gold. Knowing that, I expect my gold mines to match the paper price right to the end. But then, because they are a small portion of my bullion budget, the mine owners love me as I will keep them far longer than anyone else will. Perhaps across the valley and into the profit range we will all see the reasoning for this? (smile)

"Man's just got to know his limitations",,,, and what he's buying! (smile)

FOA/Trail Guide - Background No. 2
Hello all..Greetings from sunny southern Mexico.

Usually, if I read the material carefully and ponder it a while the meaning becomes clear but one paragraph in FOA's recent posting went over my head, particularly the last sentence...this is the paragraph:

FOA (02/09/01; 14:29:38MT - usagold.com msg#60)
------- In addition, their marking gold to market is a prerequisite to following the Fed's new inflation stance by scoring the dollar against the Euro gold price once the paper gold markets fail.-----
Perhaps FOA or another of the forum's knowledgable posters could break down that last sentence a little for me. ---------------

========
Hello MexPat and welcome Sir.

The ECB has been marking their internal gold stores to the market for a while now. This was part of their charter. If I remember correctly, it does not include the entire amounts of bullion held within the full system of european central banks, just the ECB portion. Later it may score the entire
amount, which is already some 30% at these prices! USAGOLD's site master, Randy, has been posting these quarterly reports for us. To date, the initial significance of this move by our Euro friends is cosmetic. Most of the financial world does not make much of it.

What is threatening, to date, is the open conflict of money policy this points to. The US Treasury, IMF and Fed, as a group have been demoting gold as an asset backing against their internal currency, our dollar. I think their most aggressive stance goes back to the Jamaica Accords and or
the SDR evolution. We, America, promote the value of our dollar in and of itself. Mostly pointing to our goods, services and assets that dollars can buy. Of course, if you have followed this for long, you know the dollar and near dollar supply has shot to the nearest star and will never actually convert into these products in total. At least not at current exchange rates or internal price levels in
the US.

So,,, we promote the dollar using a different format, by saying that foreigners can invest here, not buy, and find the best returns. This works as long as foreign CBs support our dollar as a reserve by saving it themselves. Making for a stable exchange rate and benign price inflation (in the US). Many thinkers have said, over the last 30 years, that those foreign CBs would never continue to do this. Well, confounding everyone, they did! Their real reasons have been our topic for years now.

However, we are now at a point unique in our time. The advent of their Euro is fracturing the ECB reasoning for continued dollar reserve support. This all moved beyond the software stage and entered the hardware era a year or so ago. Now, as some reports are confirming "for all to see",
Euroland is moving away from dollars. They started selling their interest received on US reserves a while back, and continue to do so. Randy has the actual date for this somewhere. The ECB is now, outright, selling some of it's actual reserves. The game progresses.

So, what of their gold values? Eventually, as the dollar works it's way toward becoming just a regular money, it's exchange rate will tumble. Vastly aggravated by our world class trade deficit. A deficit, I might add, that has become structural to the function of our economy in a non price
inflation manner.

Further; the high energy prices we have recently seen did not just come out of nowhere. Our energy markets and / or their political plays have not changed for 20 years. What has changed is the producers advantage of having a choice of currency to settle oil in. The Euro or the Dollar! This
process has also been a long-term topic of ours.

Contrary to what everyone thinks, the US is at double the economic oil price risk as EuroLand. Even though, initially their price goes higher than ours, because of continued dollar settlement, their entire financial structure is far less leveraged. The producers can sit back and watch who functions best, over time. And time is already working it's will within the US. You have but to read the headlines of Black Blade to know that. Thank you Mr. Blade for an exceptionally fine job!

The one thing that was negotiated into the EMU was gold's place in the world. Indeed, this is where the ECB and BIS knew their oil neighbors well. By signaling gold to be an asset, not a currency, it could be promoted to rise outside it's commodity range without competing with the new
currency. With the history of the dollar's use of gold, America's war on gold and it's locked in political stance on gold, Old World Europe played a Master Stroke. This could not help but solidify an evolution into Euro use by practically every country outside the dollar world. South
Africa plays large in this. One or two of their mines will also.

Now,,,,,, as the dollar begins to weaken and price inflation starts to march, the demand for real gold will eventually spike physical premiums thousands past the paper dollar gold markets. In ANOTHER master stroke, the BIS knew that the entire bullion house structure was endorsed and supported politically, to frame gold in a dollar price band. Outside that band, up or down, these paper markets cannot function. Especially if the driving force becomes a physical demand that drains all settlement credibility from contract gold. There will be no squeeze in these markets now, as they will be allowed to kill themselves by trying to save themselves. Inflating the supply is that process. The loss of such credibility will eventually come as trading just stops, virtually closing the dollar contract markets as we know them. Opening the door to an ECB sponsored physical
market.

If I had to guess, we will see Shanghai, Johannesburg and Dubai all joining with major internal Euroland financial centers to form the EBES (Euro Bullion Exchange System). By this time, the ECB quarterly reports will be seen as a scorecard of Dollar vs Euro values. We shall see!

I think you can take the microphone from here, sir. I've said enough on this. (smile))

Thank you

Chris Powell (02/15/01; 20:29:43MT - usagold.com msg#: 48340) Trial Guide's latest

---------- If GATA can help overthrow the gold paper market, will you not welcome it? --------

Yes, I welcome and support your efforts. There are two ways to overthrow this and understanding the politics leads to different strategies. One would be to do just as Gata is doing. The other is to buy gold and stand aside.

I fully well understand your position, the mines and certainly their shareholders should be the one's behind it, financially. This should be your source. On the other side, the fabricating industry and gold advocates, such as myself, are caught in an emotional trap by helping undermine and destroy the very process that gives them cheap product. You follow my drift?

It's kind of like supporting a local tax increase for education and environmental work; it's the right thing but will cost you in the long run. (smile) Still, we must appreciate the political thrust in a Macro view. Advocates need a clean break to all this and without public pressure from a leading point group (Gata) that break could take on a mud like consistency for several years.

I felt that it was not time yet to take real action and education was still the best venue. However, your opening presented itself and you acted in your best knowledge. Please understand, that if your action stalls, there will come a much better opening, later. You simply must wait for it.

I give the odds of this (ECB policy) carrying thru at 99%, but if it did not (1%) we would be left with a crippled industry and no free market. In this atmosphere, all pricing would be Black Market in the extreme and completely negate all the good functions of gold. A mess for everyone.

Still, given the strength of their (ECB / BIS) drive, your legal activities may have not caused a stall in the process; that being allowing the system to inflate itself into a shutdown. Your whole recent attack, while seeming strong from your standpoint, is like greenpeace circling a battleship (smile). If they decide to gun the props, your efforts will be in managing the wake more so than damaging the ship or it's purpose.

Understand, your actions still serve as a huge public service advertisement, regardless of it's success in court. So, in that light, "keep talking Bill"!! Your shots may be aimed at the real good guys in this (from a physical gold advocate's position), but that flock of turkeys standing behind them must run for cover it the big boys duck! Ha! Ha! (big grin)

Good fortune, my friends

USAGOLD (Michael),

In a line from Forest Gump; "stupid is as stupid does"!

I have to observe that; "Confidential is as Confidential does"! (smile)

The point I was making to the forum (for some time now) is that; ECB / BIS were telling everyone to go ahead and print all the paper gold the market can stand because we don't want your kind of market anyway,,, anymore.
All the while watching to see just how far the ratio of official physical to paper could expand. Sooner or later, London would hit the mathematical no return point and
something had to give. Are we there yet?

Now we see a little white flag that's; from the other side,,,, and no one else was to see it,,,,, yet it was about as private as having your general walk out on the battlefield dressed in white!
This little confidential note could be saying; let's talk about this,,,, can we work something out,,,,, perhaps we can
do whatever it is you guys want to do? (smile)

But, you never know what is behind these little notes? Could be just a trial balloon? Never the less, I think we are moving into a new stage in all this and our paper market place for gold is about to get "adjusted somewhat" for it's ability to equal physical.
As Another would most surely say to their signal,,,
"we talk now, yes"!

Randy and all,

I want to take another trail hike but am waiting for the weather to settle. Storm clouds are blowing in and I want to walk with a few private friends before the wind. Never know, might have to board up a window in the thick of it. (smile) OK, be back when able.

Randy and all,

Keep an eye on these conference thoughts (if you can)? There is a lot more being thought about than the policy
initiatives presented! Some serious thinking is surfacing there, off stage. I think some of this is tying in with gold being used again,,,, but used in a Euro format. It seems the water is beginning to flow (smile). Just so happens that the BOE is asking around themselves, by posturing their actions as questions?? Do you ever wonder how well thought plans suddenly grow from nowhere, at just the right time. This
should spark some divergent activity between paper and metal as our BBs try to stop this perception from being manifest in the markets while real gold is held back.

There was even an item:

FOA (3/10/2001; 20:58:11MT - usagold.com msg#61)
On the road!
Hello everyone!

Well,,,,,,, things are not as before,,,, are they? (smile)

In my last post USAGOLD Forum post (#48858) we noted that the paper gold game was reaching it's limits. The BOE was almost asking "what do you want us to do"? The answer came as plain as day as the paper price was driven a little lower in return for a gold sale reduction. Yes, clear as a mountain stream,,,, the unwinding has begun! It will continue until the big event when the gold rules are officially changed. Not much different than when the dollar hit it's credibility limit in 1971. As Randy has often pointed out; the US printed gold contracts back then until they (dollars on the gold exchange standard) lost their mathematical ability to be converted into gold.

Everyone that is expecting some huge paper short covering rally has got to ask themselves one question; "do ya feel lucky"? (smile) It's important to consider this because today's paper gold contract market is in the same credibility position as the dollar in 71. There is simply no way the Bullion Banking markets are going to allow our current marketplace to adjust to this mismatch by marking "This New (paper) Gold Market" to market against any true "delivered" physical gold value. Forget it! It's never going to happen during the dollar reserve era.

Just as in 71, this modern fiat gold market will be disconnected from the real gold market. Back then the dollar remained at $42 / ounce +/- as a somewhat free physical market exploded into the hundreds. Today, considering the magnitude of the mismatch we have attained, the paper market will probably never pass $360, even in the worst possible short crush. The dollar forces will call $360 the right level just as they called $42 correct??? All the while physical gold will slowly gravitate completely away from any connection to the real demands for delivery.

Even such a rise toward $360 would occur only after the BBs decided not to sell into the paper market any further. It all depends on how the rules are changed later. We shall see.

What's coming in 200?:

Let's see, spot gold is at $358 plus the physical premium of $2,200,,, so that equals $2,558 per K rand. Oh,,, you say that's crazy??? You will just demand delivery of your contracts at at $358? Or call your gold accounts for full allocation? But wait, didn't they just declare position limits, cash liquidation only for all out months, a $4,000/oz premium for spot conversion because of the shortage and forced customer reserve requirements triple the actual physical value for all converted BB physical accounts? And you wonder how or why anyone in their right mind today could pay in the future a $2,200 premium to a coin dealer? Ha! Ha! That's just the warm up, my friends.

What's in process now??:

The Washington Agreement placed in context where the Euro system is going with gold. That pronouncement drove home the fact that our Dollar gold pricing system was going to die with the dollar reserve function. The WA placed us "on the road" to high priced physical gold and low priced contract gold. It could have been the end of the LBMA pricing structure, right then and there, except that it would have clocked the global financial structure too fast.

Indeed, our Euro friends helped the system out by giving it some more of the same poison, more paper gold inflation. Yes, all the while since the WA, people have been falling all over each other trying to explain why so much new European gold has entered the market through lending. Yet, all that was mostly lent was more paper credits built upon a failing dollar gold pricing system. You see, they left the maintaining of system credibility to the dollar faction. Kind of strange how gold keeps showing up as part of the US trade deficit? Even is it's only a trickle.

Gold bugs cry that the paper market is not free because government endorsed inflation in this arena is killing it's price structure. Almost as if they want fiat gold that less inflated? Well, that's great if your "gold" money is in our modern gold producing industry and that's hip deep in committing it's product to satisfy these same paper contracts. Yes, this mistake of "hard money" allocation by western savers, is the result of ignoring history and how currency systems evolve. Gold industry investments work if the current fiat system is remaining "in use", but showing price inflation. However, when currency systems fall "out of use" while moving into super price inflation,,,,, the next competing system will side with physical gold! It doesn't happen often, but when it does real wealth in one's hand becomes worth many times investments in "almost gold". Truly, the dollar price of physical gold is going higher than anyone expects.

To make this clear:

It makes no difference if the current paper gold price bottoms here or is sold into the dirt. Just as soon as the dollar paper gold system begins to lose credibility in matching physical gold value,,,,,, gold bullion and gold bullion alone will out perform every possible hard money competitor. That includes all the other metals! "Noone" will need to teach this dynamic to the public then. All we will have to do is watch it all unfold. Believe it!

-------------------

It's coming time for our next talk about gold in antiquity. Walking the GoldTrail becomes all the easier when we understand just how little of it is truly out there. Far, far less than the paper pushers would have us think.

Until then;

"We watch this new gold market together, yes?" (smile)

Comment: On the markets!
Hello all:

We could be watching history in the making here? Physical gold demand and it's lack of supply is beginning to break the relationship between the paper gold market and physical market. Paper credibility is being seriously challenged by a sustained high lease rate and the lack of that dynamic's
ability to raise the paper pricing structure. Something we have been waiting for!

A continued falling price in the face of spiking lending rates is signaling contract supply being offered without physical supply. It's becoming a full blown paper arena (fiat gold) as the BB establishment must protect it's books to keep paper prices down, even if no gold is traded!

In the past, such a dynamic could perform the same function and still have the effect of lowering lending rates as investors dropped physical gold stores in trade for a return on fiat paper gold. That supply fed the physical market. The Dollar / Euro economic war is beginning and now, that game is driving wealth into holding real gold. This breaking ratio between paper lending rates going up and paper prices going down (if it lasts) will quickly separate said pricing structure. In time, we will embark on a different price for physical. The premiums will rise well above the paper prices, Believe it!

Note: Be sure to watch how the mining stock's traded prices fail to break from their relationship to paper prices. They will track the ups and downs of paper, even if paper fails it's ability to match physical gold. Even if physical premiums rise, mine values will follow fiat gold values? At some point the rules of exchange involving paper gold settlement will have to be changed (locking most mine product sales into the old structure) and this is when bullion will completely outperform "almost gold substitutes" by a wide margin.

Expect all past relationships to come into limbo as this all evolves. In this breaking economic enviornment expect silver to simply fall away.

We shall see.
Very busy times, now! I'll talk more later.

Hello Mr. Gresham,

I don't think I could ever measure up to that Loan Ranger fella. Bigger than life he was,,, bigger than life. (smile)

I have access to most all this forum's posts. Either I save then, my system does it or a helper handles it. Just recently I scanned quickly over the last number of days. Boy, what a wonderful diverse group of opinions and insights. Wish I could discuss all of it with everyone. Yet, for now, I must skip past most of the direct questions and deep discussions, adding something when I can. As anyone knows that have conversed with me on this venue, when time is available I talk as much as possible. (smile)

Thanks for the kind expression, sir G! Truly, if my comments suggest to you that this trail is worth following or even just studying, then I know others are doing the same. Someone once told me that following in the footsteps is easy, understanding why they walk this path and conveying that same is hard.

Not everyone can or will grasp such a long term logic concerning wealth. The benefits of keeping wealth for a lifetime only come into clear focus when years of addiction to leverage have worn a man's riches to dust. While we lament our lost bets and covet the speculative gains of others, this drug of leverage calls us to play once again. In the end, few are the savers that have partaken the
leverage bet and finish their days owning the real metal of the ages. Perhaps some giants know this all too well?

As shifty said today, "I just can't see it", concerning my reasoning of mines and why they will not come to fullness we expect. No,,,, no sir, you cannot see it. You see, it isn't just the mathematics or the legality or the morality of it all. Not event the politics of market games that we battle. The enemy is from within. Only the strong can stand firm with what the western masses perceive as a bet of little return, real gold.

Yes, we can see buying "near gold", "leveraged gold", "gold in the ground", "poor man's gold" and "almost gold". Little by little, we give it back as the rules change and time moves on. With each defeat comes hope. Hope that someday when that guy who's been buying real gold, has his day in
the sun,,, then too will my leverage bet finally make my wealth as whole as his wealth.

My friends, history and time never stand still and savings built upon the dreams of men are often lost with these constant shifting sands. The sands of human events.

-----Gold, the wealth of ages, must not only overcome the evolution of time, it must also overcome our own inability to see what cannot be seen.----------- It does this oh so well.

Thank you all for writing and thinking here and thank you Michael, very much for your efforts.

Michael (USAGOLD) and ALL:

MK has asked me if the poster using the "ANOTHER (Thoughts)" handle over on Kitco is the real thing?

HA! HA!
MK, I didn't even have to look, my friend, it is not him! This person (the real Another) commits to a purpose and holds strong that course. Then states it outright if he decides to change. While others will, no doubt try to duplicate his Thoughts, I know he would find this a good thing. Such is his nature and reasoning that he encourages thinking.

I figure there are few people in the world, with his extensive background and position, that they could point the way so far ahead of the fact. So, when reading the "Thoughts of Another" anywhere outside of USAGOLD, understand that it will only be the "Thoughts of others" writing their views.

When the next postings of Another begins, and they will, these writings will start with a "first" message and I know that that introducing letter will go the Michael Kosares before all others. Such is his style, such is his way.

Thank you all

50,000 posts! (smile) I wonder how long it would take to reread all of the again? Ha! HA!

And the good part of it all is that 90% of all those posts hold very good insights. Even the remaining 10% have sharp comments and nice links. What a great gold forum!

Hello all,


So, the contract price of gold gets sold down as if tonnes and tonnes of bullion were dropped on the market. Yet, the one month lease rate didn't return to 1/2% or some other fraudulent amount. Almost makes one think someone is selling paper bullion without the bullion behind it?

The stock markets begin to price in open economic warfare and our media says it's just a little slowdown? Now, OPEC lowers production to keep prices at a level that can only wreck the US economy and people wonder what they are doing? It's almost as if someone is moving their troops in a way that will eventually bring down the dollar and it's financial structure.

Yet, here I am, holding mostly Euros as my currency,,,,,, drawing interest,,,, and able to spend said money on goods at the same rate that dollars will buy wealth? But the currency traders say my Euros are worth less than dollars?

And my gold bullion (coins and all) are safe and sound,,,,, waiting the breakdown of the paper bullion pricing system. A process that seems to have just started,,,,,, for the first time,,,,,, in real time!

And in all of this I fully well expect my wealth holdings to not grow one bit over the next twenty years!!!!!! But, I do expect the world markets to evolve and revalue my assets, showing their true at a later time that was always their real worth today.

No, not near gold, not almost gold, not poor mans gold, not gold in the ground or other paper gold,,,,,,,,,,,, just plain old gold in the hand. An asset that will out perform every other holding in the times to come.

--------- The wealth of ages; a lifetime of work kept in a savings from our past. --------

Be back tomorrow to talk (smile).

Hello again Michael and to everyone here!

I have had some kind of a virus attack on my entire computer system. As I just told Michael (privately), I am reduced to using my home based unit to post. Whoever sent this visitor to me no doubt expected it would destroy everything (it was a very good one). It didn't. But, it will be sometime before all my data assets are available again.

I'll make some timely posts this weekend and have asked Another if he could/would fill in for me until back up to speed. We'll know in a few days or weeks? Because it's been so long from his last writings, I think he will do it as this period is a somewhat free time for him.

So, thanks to all for your thoughts, comments and good discussion. The journey continues (smile).

Well, I'll try posting today, but I must warn you that this effort is coming from the old brain cells alone. At least for a few days / weeks. I'm working thru the Home computer only (not to be confused with where I live, rather the Home unit that gathers and sends everything).

USAGOLD and USAGOLD INTERNATIONAL ------ Another is going to begin writing his Thoughts again. It'll be on the screen as it comes in. Of course, the first hello will be coming to you, Michael. Before all others. I'll work on keeping up as best as I can. Will be posting some of my items a little later.

The Journey
Thoughts are a river as it runs upon the land
they begin with a purpose and nourish us as sand

we walk a path by this water so near
and our vision must know this trail will prove dear

so trust in your heart that this way is the birthright
and the sun will light in the darkest of night

these Thoughts make us dream a truth that is whole and
"as this river runs through it, may it strengthens our sole"

----------------

Few things in life remain the same. Always near, yet sometimes far, the future is before us and will remain so for ever more. Look back for understanding, look back to know how we once thought, look back to confirm your own feelings, but don't look back to know the path ahead! That future, my friends is the water that flows from us today.

No one changes the world by their own actions. But the future can be shaped by our understanding and how we, as a people react to new perceptions. Yes, in our living of life, this very dynamic makes the world tomorrow. Better said, we are the future we seek to know! Understand us and where we are going and one can plot a course that points the future.

---------------------

With time on my hands, recently, I did a research project. I ask all the Gold bugs in the world to stand in a straight line. Then asked all the physical gold advocates to make a parallel straight line next to them. Boy, that was some long line (smile). For days on end, I talked with many of them as I walked between the rows. I was struck to make several observations:

All the gold bugs seemed to be talking nervously. Always looking up and down the row to see what the next fella was doing. With cell phones, laptop computers, private radios and every form of communication, they were all trying to do the very same thing; trying to make more currency. Almost the same thing that people who trade the stock markets are doing. Strange, I thought. The gold bugs hated this unbacked fiat currency as a wealth trading unit or a wealth holding unit, but still wanted to own more of it than the real wealth of gold. All of their actions were aimed at protecting themselves against any loss of currency function by making more of the same failing currency. Keeping ahead of the coming loss by having more of the deteriorating wealth item added to them? Kind of like a French farmer's logic reply to the knowledge that Paris is about to fall; " I'm not worried, got my wealth in cash in the bank of paris and I know the government will add to my holdings enough to cover any failures of ruler ship". So I ask myself what is the farmer and gold bug gaining here?

Standing back across the row, I asked a physical gold advocate what he made of all this? It's all very clear to me he said:
"""""""You know, fiat is a good thing in this day and time and we all could not do without it. These gold bugs would have you think just the opposite, even while they try to make more cash wealth for themselves. Yes, it's true, the current major world fiat is breaking down as it folds it's hand. But the current gold market, these bugs trade in, is run by the same guys that don't want their fiat use to end yet. So when they change the rules of the market, look at how many gold bugs leave? Almost none of them.

The rules of play, using Casino Chips instead of real gold, are all right out in the open just as the gold market we used to know becomes little more than a shell game. A Dollar Gold Casino, if you will, and the gold bugs don't want to leave it. If they can't use "near gold" to play with, they won't play at all. So, their whole advocating of the gold story is just talk. They stay right with trading fiat assets instead of gold even as their market slowly fails their purpose.

It's almost as if they didn't really want gold wealth in the first place. I see it as if they want everyone else to make physical gold worth more so their fiat based assets can grow? God awful logic for a gold advocate, but then again, they aren't gold Advocates? These are the new breed, aren't they? Fiatgold bugs? Well, I write it all off as the Gold Bugs can't see the difference anymore and still crave playing in the same house, using the same house rules. Most of them would rather the government keep the fiat going at the expense of just a little higher gold price. Say $500? Just enough to make their fiat grow. Instead of advocating holding bullion wealth and a freegold market to crash the old system. Ha! Ha!, These guys even want those in charge to change the rules back into the players favor, bankrupting the house in the process! There is no chance in hell of any casino doing that to themselves. It'll only happen when the casino's credit is taken away. And that process is in the works, don't we know! That's why I am a physical gold advocate. My time will come as the fiatgold bugs go broke with the casino. I guess it's the nature of life that we go down with the ship we sail."""""
---------------------------

Will it all pass as this gentleman presents it? I sure do think so.

Tell me, how many of you are watching supply and demand, CBOT positions, Comex OI, trading volume, gold share directions and chart TI? And for how long have these items told you nothing about the direction of currency gold prices? You see, the future of the world value of gold is now waiting on the outcome of a political currency war. A process that's been in the works for more than a few years now,,,,,, And the longer this stretches out, the more the outstanding supply of "almost gold" securities is built up. Making the whole Fiatgold Bug arena ready to fail in a mighty fall.. All done in an effort to keep the dollar system going. We have been presenting this picture for some time now and the end comes closer.

Every time the ECB doesn't "blink", ANOTHER economic nation block looks closer at the EuroZone as the backing economy for a new reserve currency. As each day passes with the EuroZone showing even marginal growth without the benefit of an American style trade deficit, the internal economic dynamics of the USA builds against it's dollar management policy. Eventually forcing the US into a full blown super inflation that has no limits.

Every day that the ECB marks gold to the market, it says that; "when the market for gold is free of the forces of dollar management, it's value will be marked to the market ----- whatever that value may be and independent of the Euro currency's use and position in the world"! Indeed, by inference, the value of oil also be marked to market through gold. Slowly, the world shifts on it's axis, my friends. We must not be blind to this change.

It is as we pointed to; the different nature of the EuroZone economies, diverse social management and attitudes towards gold values, will eventually support that nation block in the mists of a crushing US downfall. Within the total dynamic of this economic transition, physical gold values will return to a level where they will once again represent the "wealth of nations".

For us, "the wealth of mankind".

--------------------

So let the water flow clear as the sun in our day
this time is for us, as we push on for the bay

mind you this stream can speak words quiet and fair
this river of "Thoughts that are free as the air"


Ladies and gentlemen, friends and readers,

Thoughts!
To this USAGOLD Forum and Mr. Kosares, good evening.

Thank you FOA for your time and work.

We talk once again my friends. This forum, it grows strong for all ages and nature of peoples. Read they do, from all places on earth. I read and see the knowledge as written, but it be the knowledge we still must see that speaks with greater strength.

Walk the gold trails of my good friend, do I. On my feet are "strong sole" of thick leather, purchased with much knowledge of physical gold. These shoes not go bare before our journey is done. On trail I see your "thin sole" gold investments cast aside and scavenged by beasts. Their
owners walk no more as these investments took not this hard road of dollar transition. Many more will wear paper gold wealth thin before this walk be done. Only physical gold will see sun after this storm.

Some say dollar strong and holds much value still. It bends not and is strong and worthy. I say their vision is limited to see only post supporting roof. Not what on roof already or what must be placed on roof. When new Euro currency is done, full weight of dollars will return as your wet snow. In that day, we check curve of this good post, not before.

Some say dollar buys much gold and is strong in metal. I say, paper gold be not metal! We have more dollars than gold in world. As long as your system works, you sell gold to gain real dollars and we sell dollars to gain real gold. All be well in your world and mine, yes? Soon, dollar return in
bank and Euro return in bank be equal, no? More later, dollar return become even less than Euro. Tell me about your paper gold value then, my friend. Perhaps, dollar then seen strong in this lesser gold only. You think long and hard on this before end of year?

I think Euro buy much more oil then. We shall see. I will return often now. Discuss our future then.

We watch this new gold market together, yes?

Thank You

Mr Gresham (04/14/01; 18:44:54MT - usagold.com msg#: 51889)
Welcome Mr. Gresham. We talk for a time, yes?

You write:
"We who read here generally buy the coins, one ounce and less. The "Giants" you speak of are usually buying the large bars (100 ounce?), yes?"

I ask you, how many of your bars in tonne? This is the small purchase size.

"Is there a limited supply for them to get, and only through the large brokers with their "private wealth management" programs?"

I would say the BIS is best broker, always. It best to sell dollars for gold when gold is offered.

"I am trying to understand why this knowledge you bring is not being acted upon by some others with "deep pockets", such that the markets would be moved, or shortages occur, even before the dollar is seen in weakness."

My friend, you see the gold with "Western eyes". In mind, it be always, "how much currency does my gold bring". In this world of much paper gold, it bring not much dollars yes. In such matter, your currency makers do make your wealth lay low. This dream of much dollar currency for gold is the
illusion in the "Western Mind". Your men of "deep pockets" do probe for shortages, however, their wish for low supply is not to be found. Their pockets are full with "credit gold" and sad are they at currency price this brings. It is the fools game to corner paper gold printing press, no? Sir, I stand with no fools!

Days and nights do pass and one morning will bring a dollar price for gold you have never known. In that day, I will cast this currency down and walk with real wealth. In this day, the gold will trade in Euros and no bribe of credit gold will be needed to mark this new money.

Today, I my world it be how much gold does dollar currency bring. A difference in understanding from yours, I think. Today, amount of bullion available for dollars no longer the reflection of bullion dollar exchange, it be now the most terrible bribe for world dollar use. An acceptable deal in most of world, such is real world outside your laws, no?

But, it is here, in act of making extra credit gold, where the "shortage" you speak of, is measured my friend. A good man with one eye does see this time as of but few years and short days. Aside from our Euro political changes, history alone does show all great currencies end with this overselling of credit gold as last of era. This paper gold credit is always for the fools first and last. It value is later reduced to same as currency, along with holders of no gold.

It be our good fortune (and yours) that bullion is offered still. For the simple man, such as I, this wealth is that for kings but more so for his people. For all peoples, gold will be again the wealth of ages.

In this day, at end of dollar era, all do see real bullion sold for sake of market credibility, only. Perhaps too, bank credibility, I think. In this world, the lower this dollar paper price, the more bullion becomes available for credibility sake. It is the good thing for men of "small pockets" and the curse against traders and fools.

I bid you the good fortune of "small pockets" with much physical gold! We watch this new gold market together, yes?

Thank You

-- Silver slips as film sales fade faster than expected --
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html
USAGOLD LIVE NEWS

03:27 GMT-04:00 Wednesday, April 18, 2001

----Silver prices fell for the first time in a week after Eastman Kodak Co., the biggest user of the metal, said photographic film sales are falling faster than expected.

Sales from the product line that includes Kodak's main film business fell 7 per cent in the first quarter, and the company said it saw no end to the decline. Silver this year has been trading at or close to its lowest price since 1997, mostly because of weakening demand from jewellers and silverware makers.

"This news from Kodak is going to hurt silver demand," said Jim Pogoda, a trader at Mitsubishi International Corp. in New York. Given the sales outlook, the company "has already bought all the silver it needs for this year," he said.-----

Note: When the American economy goes into the tank, silver will be down there with it. We have but to watch, and learn as as the Hunts did, while this fact is proven once again. Silver, an industrial metal that never was gold. Only promoted to be.

----- I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Another back to this Table. The circle is now joined in continuity again -- all around. Already I have added to my own file of vintage "Another (Thoughts!)" with this shrewd observation:
"This dream of much dollar currency for gold is the illusion in the "Western Mind". Your men of "deep pockets" do probe for shortages, however, their wish for low supply is not to be found. Their pockets are full with "credit gold" and
sad are they at currency price this brings. It is the fools game to corner paper gold printing press, no? Sir, I stand with no fools!"

The smile of recognition returns to my face as this point is made in these few, short sentences better than I have seen it made in entire articles on the subject. Welcome back, my friend. --------

Mr. Kosares,

Thank you for your welcome and acknowledgment. I add that within this circle many feet have walked and the prints of the Kosares show most lasting impression. I see the stature of this man as American, however no Western mind is found within him. One day all will rush and follow your path before strong tide washes the deepest heal mark from sand.

It be true, my friend, in history no man does corner printing press. Many have take this path before. Even declare themselves "leaders" of "financial knowledge" and "sophistication", do they. The Gresham does make wonder about such things and asks for reason noone does claim gold from printer?

Such demand be as 100 men with contract asking Spanish farmer for 100 basket of olives where clear examination in field display only 10 basket. Such good reasoning have these men, demand delivery and illusion of wealth to others be none! None ask full collection for fear of illusion to
become reality, no? Perhaps, take what offered and wait next year. Better, sell claims for olives to Western investors with little eyes and clean shoes? Perhaps financial knowledge and sophistication of these paper sellers is more considerable than average fool. In the days that come,

"better one olive in house than six blooms on tree"!

Mr Gresham, nice question (msg#: 52041)
--- "Was the Washington Agreement the most significant event in gold since you were last posting in 1998?"---

If I may be so bold, let me anticipate ANOTHER's answer with an answer of my own.

The most significant event in gold since the dollar's gold default in 1971 has been the successful launch in 1999 of a long-awaited new currency system built upon neutral (meaning, multi-national) management and, more importantly, a floating gold reserve structure that finally abandoned the now obsolete "fixed" gold legacy of the failed Bretton Woods structure.

With this new reserve structure, the prevailing institutional incentive from '71 to the end of the millennium need no longer be one of "price suppression" for the perceived market value of gold.

In this light, the most significant element of the Washington Agreement is seen to be NOT the amount of pre-announced gold sales, but rather, the self-imposed curb on gold lending operations by these European central banks. And if you think about it, this action with the Washington Agreement was nearly just a predictable inevitability from the moment the eurosystem committed to provide for freely floating gold reserves. The "tools" of the prior suppression are on the outs. Believe it. The WA simply announced the foregone conclusion in a package suitable for newspaper headlines.

Just as the value of the post-'71 paper dollar has long been propped by the international yet artificial "mandate" to hold these dollars almost exclusively as reserves (acting in tandem with the dollar settlement for oil and the overhanging debts of the "Third World"), through this new currency structure gold (and its price/value!) has now been "officially" set free to replace these dollar reserves (savings).

The reason this full transition has not already occurred is that institutional interest still exists to foster the smoothest practicable transition until that unknowable moment where the final remaining *SNAP* in the adjustment occurs.

Speaking for The Tower and personally, I continue to buy gold with excess funds because I prefer the real wealth of gold over managed paper (and digital) contract currency. As a bonus, the real wealth value of same gold will provide a pleasant benefit upon full completion of the transition in world currencies' reserve structures. (An understatement, to be sure.)

Lombards, Normans and Franks
Hello again, everyone! (big smile)

I'm glad to see you are wearing the big wilderness bags today. You got my message that it's time for a serious hike. Alright!

After years and months of talking about gold, I have talked to friends about switching my delivery. During all this time, I did my best to emulate Another's style of presenting information and observations. Mostly here on USAGOLD, while he stood aside for a period. If you have read any bit of his works you know that style. He points to things, inserts thoughts, then drops names, ideas, political intrigues and suppositions. All in his good way of making people think and form perceptions on their own. While he has sometimes talked "through" a forum venue, in the process reaching others he knows, this endeavor was always for the citizen and never started as a shallow ploy to influence traders. It was more for the simple person that those "Thoughts" were meant. Truly, in the middle of all the gold rhetoric, his one plain comment remained intact and has never changed; buy physical gold!

During this period, I worked at breaking up my delivery. Even in clarifying, my replies were mostly partial answers. I have to admit, this has been a larger challenge than expected (smile). Now, I want to talk to you as I have plainly conveyed perception to others in the past. Using a human dynamic to make my points, as is my usual mode. So, I'll continue to employ a down home, on the trail tone. Please remember, I'm restoring a world of lost disk data while doing this. At first, most of this will be right out of the old brain.

You have read the varied items in Gold Of Troy #56 and Troy and Beyond, Even to Rome # 58, so lets get going.

-----------------------------

Onward the trail!

Look at this grand view.

It seems like forever, doesn't it? I'm actually speaking about this never ending struggle we have had understanding gold. Well, don't feel bad, mankind has been at war with gold for as long as he has gained an educated opinion about money. (grin)

Pity us. From the very beginning the good earth gave humans the perfect vehicle for commerce and trade, but we have bastardized it at every turn. No wonder so many modern people are lost to seize the day when it comes to keeping something of lasting value. They have been so influenced by today's convenient lifestyles that they lost the meanings of real structure in savings and savings with enduring historic stability! Content to trade their life's personal financial security, that these meanings would have provided, in exchange for some other perceived grander returns! Returns that only modern risk securities can provide. All the while placing an ever larger portion of their work's returns in long term peril. Assets from hard efforts they may never get to use!

It seems the whole of Western thought has some bit of concept about gold. They know it's good in crisis and will admit to making a quick shift into bullion at peril's first sign. Even Gold Bugs consider the point of timing when they will run for the cover of those big bars. Using their mine share profits to make a score! It's the same for investors in lesser metals; they just want to hit that quick ten times gain over gold before their split second switch to the yellow bullion occurs. Truly, it will never happen because gold will not hold still long enough for their purpose.

Hard money investors, to the man, point to a shortage of gold and the ongoing paper manipulation that's making it so cheap. Yet, in the mist of all their planning and strategic understanding the logic completely escapes them as to "from who" and "from where" they will all buy this bullion so quickly? As if each and every one of them has the secret timing and will beat out all the other Gold Bugs when conversion day comes. And still, somehow, someway the world bullion price will accommodate their gathered profits from playing these other "near gold" securities?

My friends, it was Another that always said "this gold market it be not as before". Perhaps this is the hidden perception that so scares Gold Bugs. The possibility that our physical gold market could jump well into the many thousands before their waited purchase. A jump in dollar value that never reverses. A jump that stops the contract function of this market in it's tracks! Frozen because the other side cannot supply the gold or the cash to cover their bet against you.

Then there is the Euro question. Many American Gold Bugs say it's just another fiat currency. But, in the same context I ask them "if that's so important to you , how did you just pay to fill up your car"? Others ask how I can trust the Euro. Well, I don't trust it any more than the dollar, or any other major world fiat. I just use it for the life function we all enjoy. Further, I ask back, how can you not trust the fiat you use?

The whole Another thrust about the EMU was to delineate the political shift that had been in progress for some 20 years. And how this ongoing shift would effect the currency valuations of everything we use. The price inflations that are coming that no one has ever deemed possible!

This shift revolved around the major world political players and their use of international trade vehicles to forward their own agenda. The very vehicles that impacted economies, and therefore our lives the most. Dollars, oil, gold the EMU, etc.. The discussion was much deeper and long-term in nature than many could grasp. It's focus was especially attuned to the coming change in the value of gold. A change so real, so profound that it's dynamic just couldn't be believed. We will indeed have to see it to believe it!

Even more so, it's all about the illusion of wealth that manifests itself so well at the very end times of major currency failures. Perhaps this is also a fear hidden in the Euro skeptics. The possibility that they will one day lose the wealth and lifestyle their dollar valuations afford them. Once again, the simple are warned from wise words, "your wealth, it not what your dollar say it be"!

Onward!
-------------

It wasn't always this way.

Gold, that wonderful metal that has all the unique qualities to function as our one and only wealth medium, and we just can't use it without altering it's purpose. You know, the Lydians had it right, back around 430 BC. They didn't struggle with the concepts of money, like we do today. They just stamped whatever pieces of gold they found laying around and kept it for trade. There was no need to clarify for certain that their gold money needed properties of "utility", store of value, medium of exchange, etc. etc.. They didn't need to identify these qualities were in gold before they stopped questioning if it was safe to use gold as savings. Gold was owned and the knowledge that people owned it and carried it for trade was alone enough to make it "worth it's weight as wealth".
-------------

Why then and not now?

You see, back in antiquity there existed another property that could override our need for modern definitions of tradable wealth. That property was found in the one identifying mark of wealth that transcended all ages; real possession!(smile) This factor and this one factor alone had the ability to activate all the other modern attributes of money properties, even when the knowledge of these attributes was unknown in the ancient era. Come now, Alexander the Great didn't know about "utility" did he? (grin)

--------------

Wealth.

As a means of example; think about art work for a moment? That fine painting that graces your main prominent wall. It's tradable for something, isn't it? Perhaps that Renoir for the acreage down the street. That use would cover some of the medium angle, right? A little bulky, but the large value makes it no more or less cumbersome than five gold bricks.(smile) Utility? Just watch your friends stare at it for hours. Store of value? A Renoir? We don't even need to discuss this .

But, one more thing, is it wealth? Of course it is. You see, it is wealth because you possess it, and the very knowledge that you possess it is held by others. One, a few or perhaps many equate your value for that painting by your possession of it. That understanding starts a need / desire valuation in the minds of your friends and associates. This social dynamic flows through relatively close groups of people and can eventually stretches across the world as it activates this worth equation in us all.

These paintings command a value, a price, a demand, precisely because everyone of them is possessed by an owner. In the world of wealth, worth is enhanced because the supply is lessened by this "possession attribute". And possession is how most people in antiquity, understood wealth.

Think now, could the worth of all the Renoirs in the world be the same if say, half of those wanting such paintings could own a credit for one? And further, they considered that credit account as the same as the real thing. No! The publicly known art value could not be the same because the demand would be lessened and the value decreased. Satisfying the wealth need of these new owners with "almost Renoirs". In this way the owners of this true wealth, represented by those real physical paintings, could not see their worth value expressed in the marketplace. However, the inherent value would still exist, just not quantified "for all to see". A situation not dissimilar to our gold market today.

So, if the attribute of "possession" is a major component and identifying mark of wealth, why does it play such a roll to enhance the modern contemporary properties of real money? Because, with money, once possession identifies the item as wealth, that alone can represent the unique utility function money must have. In this light, we can see where money need not have a commodity use to satisfy it's utility function. The wealth function alone is enough when applied to money. Wealth is the utility.

The store of value function of money is further enhanced because the possession of real wealth also continuously maintains or increases it's worth over time, across generations. And that worth or value is relative to all things.

Further, a medium of exchange alone can apply to many metals, but it must be wealth and therefore owned outright by all who use it ""if it is to correctly function in it's ability to denominate real value in commerce"". This last thing is something we Western peoples have virtually no concept of and will one day suffer for it.

Today, all forms of cash money and most financial assets do not function as wealth because their ownership is second party at best. Fiat dollars, in every form including cash only represent something owed to you. A credit of goods or effort performed. It represents nothing owned at all. Their function in society does work but it works for us by providing a lesser valuation in trade than real items would produce. We accept this concept and reduction of worth as the price for modern high speed commerce.

Many hard money philosophers have pointed their finger at others for the fiat situation we use today. It was the bankers and governments, the kings and cohorts, big business and robber barons or some communist manifesto that forced us to use this type of money. Well, you may not like the process and consider yourself above or apart from it all. You may even declare all of them evil. But, in the end, one fact remain; society may govern itself in many ways over thousands of years, but it has never stopped the evolution that corrupts the use of real money as official money.

Over time and life spans gold has been brought into official use countless times. Only to be bastardized by forces, we as peoples can never control. After every failure and ruination of much wealth, the cries always return to bring gold back as money. Once again to begin the long hard road that leads to the same conclusion. Gold coins then bank storage then gold lending then gold certificate use then lending of certificates then certificates are declared paper money then overprinted then gold backing removed then price inflation then,,,,,, we begin again. But this time it's different the hard money crowd say. Yes, it is. Only the time has changed.

For the better part of human existence, gold alone has served all of the best functions of tradable wealth. But as soon as we call it our money, human nature takes over. Yes, we can call it a stock or a bond, a piece of land or a painting, a car, boat or antique, but just don't label it as money.
---------------------

Up the hill and thru the pass!

The Lydians, Greeks and Romans all held gold. From Parthia through Rome and on to the Visgoths, Lombards, Normans and Franks, they all held gold as wealth. It was wealth first and traded as what we call money second. Possession identified that gold as real wealth, even if that ownership was for but the moment of a trade.

From the earliest times right into the Old World periods of Europe, gold served as the most valued wealth asset one could use in trade. It was by far the largest unit of tradable wealth in circulation that could be counted on to bring a premium in trade while shopping between cities. It moved, it flowed and it traveled. It was indeed, always "on the road"! Lesser metals and other tradable wealth assets always competed with gold for it's trading function, but only gold made the best "on sight" trade. When given the choice of other "almost moneys", gold would always bring an extra slice of meat or fuller basket of cloth.

The irony of gold use over most of it's earlier periods was that few average people kept it for long. Hence the seldom discovery of gold coinage where average people lived (see my earlier posts). Be sure, it represented wealth to these commoners, in good form and to the highest degree. Yet, their possession of this wealth usually constituted only a short time period. This short ownership occurred because gold did, would and could trade so much better for the needed things in life. For the worker, service wages paid in gold meant you just got a bonus or raise and the time had come to finally buy what you couldn't afford if paid in other means. If these people saved at all, it was usually in the form of the lesser metals (see my other posts).

---------------

If gold was so valuable back then, there must have been a bunch of it saved and transported into our modern time?

No, not really! We used to try and extrapolate all the gold that was mined and turned into jewelry, bullion or coin. If it was so good for coin and trade, civilizations must have saved every ounce, we thought! But something kept nagging at our conclusions. Something that kept turning up over and over at our digs.

Some of you have seen the Gold of Troy pieces or other fine examples of old gold craftsmanship at other museums. Ever notice how good they were at making gold so long ago? From intricate bracelets to rings, head dress items to fine cups, even the most thin of leaf. Some of it was so small we had to use magnifying glasses to see the work clearly.

This gold in jewelry and art work form was the other major form of traveling wealth. In many of our recent findings we now think that jewelry and coin traded places as easily as getting your check cashed today. Throughout the ancient land, gold centers occupied the trade routes. Any gold that rested for too long, was quickly recruited into a form that worked for the next traveler. In fact, evidence now points to all forms of gold ownership, not just coins, being a short term proposition for the average man. Indeed, contrary to what we thought, the fingers of all mankind did, through the ages, touch gold!

Now place yourself in that time. You work for Rome in the army, a fighting man. Not all of you were paid in lesser metals, many of you were relatively better off. You did carry some of your wealth with you in the form of gold coin or jewelry. In the case of a Roman soldier, a gold ring was very probable. When you went into battle, did you leave your few gold items laying in the tent? Or did you wire them back to a Swiss bank for safekeeping until after the battle? (big grin)

What we are finding, in the form of molecular fragments at battle sights, leads us to believe that most wars were fought with most wealth possessions worn or in pockets. Gold included. To make a long story short, we now believe that a great deal of early gold was scattered on trails, in the sea and during every war. In fact, rubbed, scraped and powdered to the four winds.

Because gold was so valuable in long trade, extremely small creations were carried as jewelry. Much smaller and much more able to be lost than other larger units of the lesser metals. The nature of so much of this gold was that it was easy to be lost and dispersed. Especially considering the modes of travel back then. We as museum visitors see all the magnificent pieces displayed. What we don't see are the countless broken, partial and fragmented items that are never offered for viewing.

Knowing what we know now, we believe that a very large portion of gold was lost and scattered on a yearly basis. Add to this the fact that most gold mining brought almost the same return as making many of the goods it purchased and we can see how gold was and is over counted. Where it was once taken as fact that all gold was looted and remelted, we now think that gold stocks were lucky if replaced.

By the time of the great gold coinages in Europe, the gold that flowed into these major commerce centers was all there was left in the world!.

Let's rest here for a few nights. There is a lot to consider before we go on.

Thanks

Hello again everyone,

I thought it would be a good idea to make some clear comments and replies regarding my perceptions. Using some questions and thoughts from the main forum will also help. This may make it easier for us all as we "follow in the footsteps"!

Auspec makes several points and contention for me to address. Please read his complete post first (and all the others I'll address). Hello auspec, you write in reference to my hike #61 here on the trail:
auspec (4/19/01; 08:48:52MT - usagold.com msg#: 52175)
-------*If the dollar's status is now so similar to what it was in 1971, why would we see the Brazil type hyperinflation now as opposed to the simple ongoing degredation of fiat that we have all come to know and hate? Why the extreme portrayal of the dollar? It's clear the dollar is an old toad and there are young stallions waiting in the wings, but it's hard to see this as an all-or-none issue where the dollar {banana} goes from being the world's reserve currency to being "nada". Where's the middle ground with dual and competing reserve currencies in common use?*
--------------------

Well sir, I'm going to try and reply in context to the way you asked these questions. Considering well all your prefacing stated before asking for info.

Using the 1971 dollar incident is a perfect way to engage common ground thinking about our contract gold market today. No it's not a perfect analogy, but it's real, real close and sharpens our understanding and ability to see the subject clearly. Especially considering the tremendous number of different hard money people that read this Centennial Forum. But we must not confuse the point by thinking a similar break today will cause the coming price inflation we speak of.

Yes, after the 71 dollar gold break, we did see some good price inflation. But was that caused by the wholesale cancellation of international dollar convertibility into gold? No! That price inflation was not gold backing related because we had already, years before, been printing dollars far beyond our stated gold to dollar conversion ratio, $42+/-. That spell of price run ups was the result of to many dollars being printed before and after the 71 gold breaking event.

Sure, the gold price run up after that didn't help the dollar's image. But, by then it didn't make any difference what the gold price was. Even if it want back to $10/oz. we were never going back to governing the volume of dollars in supply. Not by using gold, not by silver, not in any way that would fix or slow the presses! We couldn't. Any long term slowdown, then or now, in such an established fiat was well past the politically survivable stage. This is the way fiats work, rather gold backed or not, they always break from strict printing discipline. The history behind us says so and the future before us says so. As an example in dollar terms, look at any five year average of money supply growth from 71 till now? Truly, we were and are printing our way towards the end time of dollar use. The only question was how long would the world keep using dollars? How much longer
would the timeline extend?

Some hard money people thought that the world would simply convert to gold itself, in place of dollars. But, the simple fact, as I and most especially Another have made so often, is that the modern world must use a fiat form of currency to operate. And, considering that point, after the 71 gold break, there was no other strong, fluid currency for us to revert to. It wasn't until the end part of the 70s that the Europeans started down the long road of creating something else.

There were times when our foreign trading partners were thinking of breaking away. This is when the US spiked rates. Again, we confuse this action with stopping the inflation presses. Quite the contrary, the killing rise in rates was just a signal that we would not go completely hyper. On our side, the only reason we could afford to take this economic killing gamble was because oil was still priced and settled in dollars. But that is a whole Another book.

The prestige of many international dollar holders took a real bath because they held dollars in place of gold. When they tried to initially bid for gold, the US and London made sure the price rose fast enough to tell a story to these dollar converters. That is; "bid for gold and it will soar" cutting off your conversion. Sure the US made all sorts of noise about how awful and incorrect the rising gold price was. Even showed their hand at managing the price a little so it didn't go up too fast. All the while saying they were fighting for all they were worth to keep it down! Truly, the last decade shows naive Gold Bugs just how much in control they were and are of this so called "free commodity market in gold". Oh well, back to your point.
---------

You see, the dollar is going to fail now because a good alternative is available now. All this has something to do with the coming new gold valuation, but that new price level is not related so much to gold backing a currency again. (more on that in a min). The dollar is toast because most of the world doesn't like the management policy. They didn't like it in 71, but tolerated it because gold was suppose to keep flowing in repatriation payments. And if they didn't like it back then, they god awful hate it now!

We like to think that the dollar is what it is because we are so good. (smile) But, the truth is that for over a two decade period +, none of our economic policy, our trade financing policy, our defense policy or our internal lifestyle policy has pleased anyone outside these borders. We managed the dollar for us (U.S.) and the rest could just follow along.

Our fiat currency has survived all these years because others have supported our dollar flow in a way that kept it from crashing it's exchange rate. We talk and think like we are winning the tug-of-war when, in fact, they just aren't pulling to hard. Waiting for their own system to form up.

Truly, most of the world likes the most conspicuous aspect of the euro that we describe as it's biggest weakness; it's management by several varied nation states. All supporting different thoughts, cultures, backgrounds and perceptions of government policy. Some compare it to the many nationalities in the US, but it's much more competitive than that. It's thought that this mixture will produce a more good for all management of a Euro world reserve currency. Truly, because gold plays no part in today's dollar management or the Euro, then political styling is all that's left.

My friends, a national fiat in our modern world only functions if the whole world uses and supports it's flow and most importantly likes it's management (political styling is the catch word). This support and use of our dollar can and will change faster than many think possible once the Euro is finished. Our dollar is not going to become a "banana" or "nada" in the future, as auspec notes. It already is and has carried this trait for some time now as does every fiat today. The only thing that keeps them from cascading away is world support and use.

Point:
When most of the major players that styled the Euro decide to swing even 1/2 support toward that new money, the exchange rate for our dollar will plunge to it's true worth! That dollar value is there now, you just don't see it yet. The price inflation that many (auspec) don't / can't see happening, will be the result of our currency management changing to confront the nature of all the above. The world economic financing, pricing, saving, settlement and opinion is shifting toward the Euro. As this happens the US will have to raise rates ever higher, even as it massively prints more currency to support our internal economy. Our entire economy will slow and fail as this price inflating process moves on. Some will call it stag / flation, but will change that description as the it becomes more of a crash / hyperinflation.

Right now, the actions of our fed is telling this truth. We must inflate while we watch the Eurozone enjoy it's basically internal trade economy. As other nation blocks embrace that zone, they will pull economic function from us.

You write:

*Comments: Again it is easy to see the dollar as losing a large piece of the action, but hard to see its total demise or its falling out of use. The US as the largest military force in the world certainly has its overriding benefits. The US has enormous resources; physical, financial, and spiritual. American creativity and "know how" has changed the world. This country will not turn over and simply give in! Let's look forward to the next 5 years and place probabilities on what is likely to happen as far as the dollar/euro is concerned. I will rank these various scenarios in what I see as their most likely odds of happening:
-------------------
Auspec, before I list your most likely odds, I would like to comment on your above.

We must not confuse a currency's "total demise" or "falling out of use" with a "loss of identity". In our time there have been few major moneys that went away. Today, we have a whole world of national fiats "in use" and "not demised" that still carry their nations identity. They lose value at an incredible rate, are mismanaged to the highest degree, are laughed at and despised. But, still they are "in use" as they function for their governments and economies. Usually, they function along side whatever major reserve currency is in vogue. Today, the dollar, tomorrow the Euro. Make no mistake, the entire internal US sector can and will function as it's currency runs a price inflation just like these third world countries. We will adapt as they have by dropping our living standard accordingly and adopting the Euro as our second money. Also:

The prestige that we have the largest military force in the world does not help our money problem. We talk as if we will let any country die that does not use our money or support our currency. I point out that the British also made such comments and it didn't stop their downfall. Nor the Russians. Also:

I point out that many, many other countries also have the same "enormous resources; physical, financial, and spiritual" that we have. But the degrading of our economic trading unit, the dollar places the good use of these attributes in peril. Besides, the issue beyond these items is our current lifestyle. We buy far more than we sell, a trade deficit. Collectively, net / net, using our own
attributes and requiring the use of other nation's as well. Not unlike Black Blade's Kalifornians sucking up their neighbors energy supplies (smile). We cannot place your issues up as example of our worth to other nations unless we crash our lifestyle to a level that will allow their export! Something our currency management policy will confront with dollar printing to avert. Also:

NO, "this country will not turn over and simply give in" as you state. But, we will give up on our currency! Come now, let's take reason in grasp. Our American society's worth is not it's currency system. Around the world and over decades other fine people states have adopted dollars as their second money, only to see their society and economy improve. Even though we see only their failing first tier money. What changes is the recognition of what we do produce for ourselves and what we require from others to maintain our current standard of living. In the US this function will be a reverse example from these others. We will come to know just how "above" our capabilities we have been living. Receiving free support by way of an over valued dollar that we spent without the pain of work.
--------

Your "various scenarios" with mine notes added :
1}Ongoing MODERATE debasement of US Dollar. {Brisker} Business as {than} usual.
----Near term, yes.-----
2}Gold and/or Oil breaks away from the dollar.
---- Oil is already doing so for a year now. The gold market is in the process of self inflating it's paper side of the function. The first minor lease rate signals are already behind us. The ECB and BIS are coming more in control as the dollar faction must either sell it's gold also or begin to fold. If they want the game to continue a little longer the US must not put it's gold on the market or the BIS and ECB would bid it with their dollar reserves. Ending it all then and there.------
3}Dual and competing reserve currencies. "Co-Currencies" in Reserves. The currency war that is in clear sight {thanks to ANOTHER and FOA}.
----- I would add that the vision of co-currencies is just a passing function as we get from here, dollar reserve, to there, Euro reserve.-----
4}Status quo.
----- We have not been here in our life times (smile).--
5}All out war that distracts/rescues the dollar and extends its life. Wag the dollar.
------ As we enter the down side of our economic function (like we are doing now) the massive money printing by the fed will risk the dollar's slow slide to becoming a super slide if a war breaks out. People run to the best managed world money in a war, not just the one with the current best exchange rate value. In the past the dollar was the one, today the Euro would receive the flow. The US would be risking killing it's last bit of dollar timeline with any war today.---------
6}Dollar merged with euro/backed by euro.
------ I know a few people that make a lot of sudden money wealth and give almost all of it to the church (or charity). Others are much more smarter and support the church (or charity) for the rest of their life. Retaining some control over how the charity is used. This is how the EuroZone would handle us. Actually, it's the same way we handled them after the war. We didn't just merge our checkbook into theirs, did we? Net / Net, they will have the wealth to be offered, not us.------
7}Brazillian or Weimar style hyperinflation of the USD, the Big Banana, or the 'little banana'.
------- Full on, wide open, in your seat, flat out! It's in the pipeline!------

You write and I comment:
Debt is designed for default as fiats are for debasement.
--- My friend, debt is the very essence of fiat. As debt defaults, fiat is destroyed. This is where all these deflationist get their direction. Not seeing that hyperinflation is the process of saving debt at all costs, even buying it outright for cash. Deflation is impossible in today's dollar terms because policy will allow the printing of cash, if necessary, to cover every last bit of debt and dumping it on your front lawn! (smile) Worthless dollars, of course, but no deflation in dollar terms! (bigger smile)
At $30,000 POG the US as we know it will be no more, agreed?
-----Agreed, but still in use. Just like all those Pesos around the world! But remember, at the very least, the first $10,000 of that figure would represent the current purchasing power of the dollar today. We will most likely get there long before price inflation jumps way up. Once the current dollar gold market fails and gives way to a free physical price, we will see that figure even as our
economic function drives all other hard money metals into the toilet. I talking about .50 cent silver. while gold races past it's first grand. When we see it we will understand it.-----------
What advantage would it be to the Power Elite to destroy the dollar.
-------- Wrong context. What advantage does the Power Elite gain by expending assets to save an already failed currency. Better to do what major players have done for centuries and are doing now, buy gold and evolve your power base to use the next reserve.-----------
The end of a currency's lifetime always ends in gold debasement?
---- In almost every case. Sometimes in the open, sometimes hidden.------

Ok, this is going overtime (smile). I will try to cover more (and others) in a day or so. Also, the question of Another at his keyboard? I reword things from him quite a bit for bare readability. But, his delivery is pure. I don't always pretend to understand it. Then, that's a whole other story (smile)

After all that Centennial has done to build and maintain this hall,,,,, a search engine should be made avaliable to clients of CPM only or, by extension in return for doing business.

Hello again!

Continuing along with our discussion, clarifying some points and positions, we once again offer some straight talk. Elwood has some points in his Elwood (04/19/01msg#: 52225). Sir, you referenced our last full hike on the GoldTrail #64, quoting first this portion:

"Many hard money philosophers have pointed their finger at others for the fiat situation we use today. It was the bankers and governments, the kings and cohorts, big business and robber barons or some communist manifesto that forced us to use this type of money. Well, you may not like the process and consider yourself above or apart from it all. You may even declare all of them evil. But, in the end, one fact remain; society may govern itself in many ways over thousands of years, but it has never stopped the evolution that corrupts the use of real money as official money."

Then you write:
------ Thank you, sir, for sharing your deep thoughts. True, your words are, but why is this a reason to abandon the fight for sound money? Surely you must be aware of the massive inefficiencies that will accompany a system with two moneys. There will be two prices for every good, one stable, the other not. Would not the timeline of such a system be extremely short compared to that of a system of sound money even though the sound money eventually becomes corrupted? How is this system better (or even different) than what we have today?---------
Hello Elwood (smile),

The fight for sound money is not dissimilar from the ages old fight for peace in the world. Mankind has been striving for peace over our entire existence and still it does not come. Countless lives and fortunes have been lost and the same battle continues. Perhaps we should reexamine our collective needs and try something different. Truly, what is to be lost? This is the same mind set our new political styling is shooting for. It's a good effort because history is on their side.

Yes, it's a noble effort to try and get the world on a sound money program, but after failing at it for centuries, a little side trip cannot hurt. (smile). Most people, like yourself, say sound money and think sound currency. Usually it's some form of gold backing that makes the currency sound. The trouble is it cannot be maintained. The logic in my words above are evident and the last part of the statement demonstrates the selfreplicating nature of our dealings with "sound money". Again, in a restructured form:

"""Society has never stopped the evolution that corrupts the use of real wealth (gold) as it strives to use it as official money""""

Elwood, I don't care if all of it is legal or illegal, moral or not, right or wrong, because the larger issue overwhelms these arguments. That being; we have never been able to control our power structures in a way that disciplines the printing of currency. The Romans alloyed other metals into their gold in a form of modern day paper printing. Even in the so called wonderful days of the various gold standards, be they actual coins or paper substitutes, the world debased the system from the start. Also you write:
----Surely you must be aware of the massive inefficiencies that will accompany a system with two moneys. There will be two prices for every good, one stable, the other not.-----
We never intend to have two moneys. The concept is better seen as the Euro and a wealth reserve. Still, to defend against your thrust, what do we have now? Travel the world, my friend and mingle in the world of currency. In almost every country of the planet there are several prices for ever good sold! All depending on what nations currency you choose to use. Today's system is working with perhaps hundreds of moneys!
------Would not the timeline of such a system be extremely short compared to that of a system of sound money even though the sound money eventually becomes corrupted? -------
My goodness, we have used a dollar system that has been debased and on the way out for 40+ years. Well before our 1971 gold break, this country was printing IOUs as if they were currency. Yet, the thinkers of our time, the same ones that employ two week trades on the stock markets, all ask for guarantees of decades before considering a new currency? Planners simply cannot employ the logic of a group that trades options, futures, strips and swaps, then asks for longevity before the fact.
-----How is this system better (or even different) than what we have today?---------
The real issue is our misunderstanding and misuse of the term "sound money". That thought has been bantered around for hundreds of years. Truly it does not exist except in the minds of men.

Money, the term, the idea, perhaps the ideal,,,,,,, is something we dreamed up to apply to one of our chosen units of tradable wealth. Usually gold. We could take almost every item in the world and use it in this same "money fashion". Still, this form of trading real for real is just exchanging wealth. It isn't exchanging money as we understand money.

Gold is no different than anything else you possess as your wealth, it just so happened to be the most perfect type of tradable wealth in the world. So it evolved to be used the most and eventually labeled in the same function of what we consider to be "sound money".

Now, consider that all wealth is represented in and of itself. You cannot reproduce wealth through substitution, like giving someone five pieces of copper for one piece of gold and then have then think they now have five pieces of gold! This is the process we try to perform within the realm of man's money ideals. We have always debased trading wealth by duplicating it into other forms and calling all of it, collectively, "our money".

This duplicating, this replicating, this debasement is the result of taking the concept of a credit / contract function ( paying in the future) and combining it with the concept of completing a trade at the moment. Think about that for a moment?

As an example, I'll give you a paper contract to pay you later for some oranges and you give me the basket of oranges. Better said, I just gave you modern man's actual concept of money.

Or I trade you a basket of apples "or gold" for those same oranges and the deal is finished, done! We have been taught to think that this is also the concept of money trade.

The first uses what our currency system has evolved into, what is really money in our mind. Where the second uses no credit form at all and is more comparable to trading real wealth as the ancients traded using gold.

Contemporary thought has always blurred these two notion; saying that these two methods of trading are one in the same and both forms use the same idea of what we think money is.

Further refined; we evolved our money ideals into a perception that credits and contract payments can be used as if they contain the same value in payment as trading real wealth. They could and can if managed correctly. But, we have never managed credit money to match the same proportions as existing real wealth (gold). We have tried to manage this combination of wealth trading and money credit for as long as we have been seeking "peace"!

So:
We use, today, many forms of wealth holdings, all standing right beside our dollar use. Many of these wealth items have and do perform much better than our fiat currency. One has but to use one stock holdings as an example.

You may have $5,000 in cash in hand and in a checking account, while also owning $200,000 of ,say, Microsoft? Obviously, the stock is a competing, dual form of currency wealth. It's value rise has overshadowed the gain on your fiat. But, is it driving your currency out of circulation? Seen anyone recently using this superior form of competing wealth to pay for a fillup at the station? No?

We all need and must use some form of fiat currency to operate in this modern world. It makes little difference if MSFT went to $10 or $10 billion, you would still use the currency system in trade as a more efficient form of modern trade. Society now uses these " money" systems without any form of gold backing, not because they are "strong" or "stable", but because they work more than they fail.

Still, over the last several decades, we now have come to expect an attempt at "political styling" our fiat money that benefits more than one nation block. Further, we expect a wealth asset to not so much stand behind the system but to measure it's speed of failure or success. Knowing full well we will accept and expect some loss of value as payment for this use convince of Fiat Euro.

This is the road ahead. A fiat no different from the dollar in function, yet a universe away in management. A wealth asset that also stands beside this money, yet has no modern label or official connection as money. In this way modern society can circle the earth, to once again begin where we started. Having learned that the concept of wealth money and man's money were never the same. We shall see.

Thanks

Trail Guide- Silver

Hello da2g,

You write:
-----Is not a hyperinflation ultimately deflationary in that there is a dearth of credible means of purchase? Why would silver not benefit from this, at least temporarily? Could this be a means of transiently parking purchasing power, superior to paper that is quickly losing value? Could not
silver benefit from demand as money? Could silver be a means of barter that changes hands in commerce, whilst gold is held in the background as a wealth asset?------

Well sir,
The coming super inflation of our dollar could more accurately described as a super currency devaluation. Where the Euro becomes the dominate settlement currency and our dollar reaches a level to match it's long term history of over creation. In making this point before, I pointed out that the dollar is going to reflect it's "unsupported value", where it is no longer propped up on world
markets.

During this type of devaluation, the internal price inflation, within the US will have all the attributes
of a real hyperinflation. With one compelling difference; another currency will be available for use. Foreign exchange controls will be in play, I'm sure, but will not reflect a total freeze on currency flow. The same will ultimately be true for gold. Mostly because we must import oil and other
necessities and gold will be tradable as the one true measuring asset officially market to a free market. I also fully expect that our government will endorse the ownership of physical gold by it's citizens, if for no other reason than to blunt the rush for Euros. Still, as in my last reply, US reactions could be uncertain for a time. Therefore, the holding of rare / old coins is absolutely a
must.

So, in this montage of events, in time, there will be ample dollars, Euros and gold for ownership. All reflecting their own values, of course, but trading never the less. Considering this point, this blunts one of the main attributes of owning silver as a trading vehicle in place of a usable median. More than anything, silver will reflect it's industrial use demand of which the US is the current major user by a wide margin.

Further, comparing the worth of an ounce of silver against an ounce of gold today is liken to balancing two entirely different structures. Such as asking which is heavier a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers? Obviously, they weigh the same but the weight comparison is worthless. Today, I could easily say that gold is much more a bargain than silver because an ounce only costs $260 where 100 ounces of silver cost $450. Any fool could see that gold is the cheapest and what a bargain for sharp investors! (smile) But, we don't do this because it isn't a valid value comparison. No matter the unit weight or size. Yet, the silver bulls try to sell this to anyone that will listen.

Also:

------ unless I am mistaken, I seem to recall ANOTHER stating years ago that silver may have some value in this situation.------------

Well sir, Another does hold this view and he has a grasp for the human dynamic like nothing I have ever seen. But, I will at least take a middle position in that this transition, from a US standpoint, may not politically follow my outline. There is always the unknown when at the peak of financial
crisis. Still, most major players, both historically and today, hold gold bullion for such a situation.

Just as investors ran to bullion (and dollars) in the past, they will run today with their currency portfolio into the best managed currency. Right now the ECB has the best ship to sail during the storms preceding the coming transition.
For the hard position of their wealth they will run for
the most officially supported free market. In the near future, gold will hold that position, hands down.

Further, when in a crisis, you don't want an investment and that is what all the statistics about silver are all about. In a major international currency war, you want a wealth holding that the world is running to. Not some idea about a return that will work this time yet, has failed more than a few billionairs in the past.

Thanks

Trail Guide: Silver

Mr. Gresham, hello,

I own some silver and everyone here that has read my posts knows it. But, just like gold stocks, it's a minor position compared to gold bullion.

More importantly, I have talked endlessly about the possibility of our paper gold market falling in price as these contract securities are sold into oblivion because of default fears and the piling on by shorts. Enforcing a situation where physical gold runs in the opposite direction.

There is a whole world of people out there that are leveraged to the hilt in silver waiting for the big event. If our paper gold market tanks, the pressure on the silver price will be enormous! In many ways reenacting the very leverage these bulls are looking for, but all of it in the other direction.

There are few people that will retain a position in an "investment" like silver if the paper pricing market is hit, bigtime. Forcing the selling of everything. Where as in gold the world community will grab all the free bullion available (jewelry included). Because gold is not perceived as an investment nor as an investment with an industrial use component.

In the initial crisis, silver could hit the floor and stay there for some time. It all depends on how this plays out. For myself, with the explosive potential of physical gold to show it's real value, I don't need silver. (smile)

Hello Elwood,
You write:

-------"But, sir, none of these things are gold. Is it not the *label* of money, but its *use* as money that makes a thing money? How can we officially deny the use of pencils for writing, yet still maintain the "free market value" of pencils?" Yes - despite the volume of words, this simple point is left unaddressed. Thanks for your keen
observations! ----------

Sir,
Can you use a "promise" as money? Sure you can and often do today, because that is how you paid for your last fillup. You use it, but that doesn't make it wealth money, just a fiat money. My talk to Elwood on the Trail covers this deep concept. (smile)

All,
I made a blunder in this post (above)when addressing it to Elwood. Actually it was to ET, who was commenting to Elwood. But, I suspect most of you were able to read through that mistake (smile).

I have a large function to attend now and cannot comment on the next series of points from you. Even though they make a good connection for me to carry the discussion right into the West Point business. That's the first real break in the dam that shows the game in play. Not exactly as it was explained, but close (grin).

Mr. G,,,, Elwood,,,,, others, I will comment later.

Mediterranean Arab Free Trade Area (MAFTA)
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html
Just a few items. Looks like it won't be long before someone sees the advantage of using Euros only in the settlement of trade! Could oil trade settlement be far behind? And all of this started in 1995, before EMU,,,,,

Arab states look to create offshoot of Euro-Med free trade
agreement By Rana Awwad


-----------
AMMAN — Arab member states party to the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements are set to study the possibility of establishing a Mediterranean Arab Free Trade Area (MAFTA) during their next meeting in May, officials said on Sunday.

--------
The meeting, to be held in Brussels, will also examine the harmonisation of rules of origin amongst the Arab partners as a first step towards achieving the trade area.
---------

The Jordanian-EU bilateral agreement was developed under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a governmental forum comprised of the 15 EU member states and 12 Mediterranean countries, including Jordan.
-----------

The 1995 Barcelona Process which established the Euro-Med partnership, calls for gradual trade liberalisation between members, with the ultimate goal of establishing a Mediterranean free trade zone.
-------

Meanwhile, European imports will be granted preferential treatment depending on the agreed schedule of reducing tariffs.

Replies and Custodial Gold

,,,,,,,Two French men were fishing in a boat, just off of Nice. Several other boats were within close sight, always watching to see if these guys found anything. All of a sudden Henri hooks a huge one and brings it to the surface while Pierre nets it. Both of them look at the fish in the net and hesitate, not wanting to bring it onboard. "What is it", Henri asks? "I don't know, can't make it out, but it's a good one, I'm sure" says Pierre. By god, whatever you do, don't haul it in. If we can't name it the other boats will laugh at us. Let's just keep the net in the water, pointing at it and talking loud while we circle the boat. Eventually, one of the other boats will get a look and blurt out it's name,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,, Eventually, the ruckus attracted hundreds of other boats (the miracle of marine radio and the internet) and they stormed in close to see the news. During all this action, none of the other boats saw the fish very well, therefore no identifying name was mentioned. Eventually, tired from throwing out various possibilities of the significance of the catch, Perre and Henri pulled the thing in for all to see.,,,,,,

,,,,,, To their amassment, no one else knew the exact name or significance of this exceptionally fine fish! You see, there just wasn't enough details about it, "floating around" (smile) to know it's purpose. But still, all hailed the duo as superior fishermen and brought them drinks and dinner in port!,,,,,,,,

The moral of this story: In this game of life, we all fish from time to time. But, to a sportsman, the size or type doesn't matter because it's the art of catching that counts. Besides, every catch has a name and we will eventually find it's "namer". (bigger smile)

Thanks for attempting to understand it all. If you follow our lead, we will not change your mind about anything. Rather, you will have the "luxury" of seeing things in a different context from the usual Western Gold Bug fixation. With that perception becoming part of your "Total" overall understanding, as events occur, you may choose to interpret their impact differently.

Hey FOA - thanks for your thoughts. You write in part;

"This is the road ahead. A fiat no different from the dollar in function, yet a universe away in management. A wealth asset that also stands beside this money, yet has no modern label or official connection as money. In this way modern society can circle the earth, to once again begin where we started. Having learned that the concept of wealth money and man's money were never the same. We shall see."

I happen to know from history that your idea will fail. It will fail because there is no difference between wealth money and man's money, despite any forthcoming "new age" management. You see, FOA, markets can't be managed, and every time it's tried, they fail. Yours will be no exception.
Hey ET,
I think yourself and anyone else that takes your position on my posts should reconsider my thrust. Our libraries and history halls are chock full of records that endorse our perception fully. All of your great money thinkers engaged the very same problem; trying to force society's power structures to use gold and it's decline as official money.

It's not the management of money that was the problem, it was the management of man's authority to maintain gold and it's decipline. Over and over, we watch good monetary theory fail as society fails to control their controllers. Then, your good scholars document the "every reason" and "what for" of why it failed. We read it all, teach it all in schools and once again, history repeats. The money presses come on!

The road before us is to not manage gold. Rather, stop it entirely. Forget about calling it official money and let it seek it's own level against every fiat as a worldly wealth. In every other asset, we now have countless examples of other forms of wealth that walk side by side with our current dollar system. Practically all of these have far outperformed (thanks Mr. G.) our pure fiat dollar. Some doing so at incredible rates! And to date, none of them have obtained more settlement use than our digital currency. Even the underground people go back to currency eventually. This ongoing fact is an enormous experiment happening right before our eyes. For twenty+ years this has happened as our dollar is proclaimed, unusable! Yet, Gold Bugs loudly proclaim that gold would supplant the Euro if allowed to seek it's own level as wealth.

My friend, you should also read your scholars books again, for they tell the very same tale we do. We have read a few (smile) and embrace their position, but our position stands aside the needs of a modern Gold Bug that prefers a "fiat" gain on leveraged gold investments. We present it from a Gold Advocate's stance, that holds gold itself as the wealth while embracing society's pennant for fiat.

We never intend to have two moneys. The concept is better seen as the Euro and a wealth reserve. Still, to defend against your thrust, what do we have now? Travel the world, my friend and mingle in the world of currency. In almost every country of the planet there are several prices for ever good sold! All depending on what nations currency you choose to use. Today's system is working with perhaps hundreds of moneys!
----------
---does the ECB intend to hold works of art, boats, land or any other wealth items as part of its reserves? Will they officially mark their currency against any of these other wealth items? Can you understand my skepticism regarding this attempt to "un-money" gold? -------------
Hello again Elwood,
My analogy using various art works was meant as an example of how other wealth holdings currently ride next to our dollar system. Just as above in reply to ET, wealth can and does outperform fiat and people do not short circuit the system in a major way.

The ECB is treating gold completely different than the dollar faction. Where the US has seen gold as a competitor for their failing currency, they tried to destroy it's "known dollar market" value through paper manipulations. Something we have been chronicling for years, now. Prior to EMU, gold was the dollar's only replacement and because of the dollar's massive, overwhelming printing, was a major threat. Understand that it wasn't just the printing of this fiat that threatened it's replacement, it was it's one-sided management in a many sided world. For the US, keeping the dollar price of gold down was, for a long time, the only way to keep some nation states using it. Allowing the markets time to cycle gold for dollars at ever lower exchange rates.

The ECB is using the current leveraged paper gold market as a way to force the dollar faction to break itself. Their marking gold to market is a hangman's roap, just waiting for the prisoner to climb the stairs. When the US "WALKS" FROM HONORING CUSTODIAL GOLD, once again like in 1971, that will be the end! The system wide banks of the ECB will allow the dollar gold market to soar. Creating a wealth reserve not unlike their holdings of other currencies, only far more true to human perceptions. As the dollar crashes on foreign exchange markets, these CB dollar holdings will be just cast down, as Another said. No need to spend them.

Elwood, they are not trying to Un-money gold! They are going to un-Westernize gold so it performs it's historic function of acting as a tradable wealth holding. No longer following the Gold Bugs view that governments need to control gold so it acts like real money in the fiat sense. Truly, the BIS and ECB are today "Walking In The Footsteps Of Giants"!

Elwood writes my words then comments:
---------
"Now, consider that all wealth is represented in and of itself. You cannot reproduce wealth through substitution, like giving someone five pieces of copper for one piece of gold and then have then think they now have five pieces of gold! This is the process we try to perform within the realm of man's money ideals.

This duplicating, this replicating, this debasement is the result of taking the concept of a credit /contract function ( paying in the future) and combining it with the concept of completing a trade at the moment. Think about that for a moment?"
--------------
Yes! This is what we need to fix. As long as man believes that he can (without cost) create value, capital or whatever by making a bookkeeping entry in a ledger, we will live in a world possessed by the ìcopper into goldî illusion, no? But there is nothing wrong with credits and contracts as long as they are backed at par by real money, because there is no illusion in this. We are capable technologically of creating such a system, and we will have a prime opportunity politically when the dollar reserve function dies.
Sir Elwood,
Today, our perfect gold system has been bastardized into it's current form. Over a half century or more, we eventually came to this. No there is nothing wrong with hard credits and contracts, based on the discipline of gold. But, we as a society cannot create a force strong enough to save our children from the eventual inflation this abuse creates! Gold or no gold, as with peace and war we end up with fiat anyway! The illusion is in our calling gold money and using it in a fiat credit function. For thousands of years, from baskets to computers, carts to cars, guns to rockets,,,,,, this new prime opportunity of which you speak,,,,,,,, has always been blowing on the wind!


Again Elwood writs my words, then his:
-----------
We all need and must use some form of fiat currency to operate in this modern world. It makes little difference if MSFT went to $10 or $10 billion, you would still use the fiat currency system in trade as a more efficient form of modern trade. Society now uses these " money" systems without any form of gold backing, not because they are "strong" or "stable", but because they work more than they fail.
-------
No! Fiat is used only through threat of force. ANOTHER implied as much when he stated that this was a way to get oil off the dollar without war. I ask you, sir, look around you. See all the things in your life brought to you by voluntary exchange through the market economy? An economy capable of all this is certainly capable of producing a free-market medium of exchange, no? This is what I mean by sound money (the Rothbard way).
Elwood,
Your note of Another is out of context from the discussion and events of that posted time. I completely agree that our market economy is a sophisticated, remarkable thing. However, Rothbard tells the way it should be done and history tells the way it was done. Indeed, while we may never overcome the human failures of war and fiat inflation, the wealth of common man does not have to be expended while society tries yet another time.

Thanks for your thoughts, sir. (smile)

TRAIL GUIDE---ESF/Bundesbank-----
===============

Hello Gentlemen,

I suspect the gold in West Point was reclassified in a show of good faith to those that own some international gold paper. I'm talking about people who's reasonably priced product you cannot live without. I doubt the gold has outright swaps written against it or was swapped into the enemy's camp (so to speak). While the ESF has the right to trade currency swaps against other's gold (and they do do this). Our gold has yet to be possessed by others. Just as in 1971, when many dollar holders thought US gold was "in custody" for them, so to does the current world dollar gold markets. However, this open certification shows just how tight the system has become.

We have said for some time that the dollar faction has inflated paper gold and done so with very limited actual bullion of their own. We maintain that most of the leverage created in this arena has been done with the gold of private Western owners. Modern GoldBug owners that once held physical gold but now seek gold leverage and gold industry investment instead of gold wealth. That gold has now been leveraged for all it's worth as it filled the use void. Today, we are reaching the mathematical end that that game can be played. Others know this and the West Point business is an attempt to counter this perception. Even if it was only a political move. We are getting close though (smile).

There is no logic in that the Bundesbank would risk it's gold. They were major supports of the Washington Agreement. Counter to perception, the entire EuroZone CB system awaits the day when they can convert failed paper gold borrowers into Euro borrows. As our paper gold market fails to function, shuts down and physical gold soars, there will be no bookkeeping market to offload these paper positions into. The conversion ratio into Euros will then be something to behold. Along with the demand for currency Euros and physical gold! The BIS /ECB is delighted that the dollar faction is lending all the "gold on paper" the dollar market can stand. Eventually, the US will walk right up to the gold window with the intentions of selling, only to fall away as they stair at a mountain of foreign CB dollars.

"""We watch this new gold market together, yes?"""

@Trail Guide re Arab free trade zone
Trail Guide,

This one has been in the works for some time now and indeed, there is a direct tie to the Euro zone. The economic and trade news from the region as has been quite remarkable as of late. Indeed, we have the beginnings of a natural gas grid between, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey. The same countries have also agrred to a common electrical grid. The free trade zone has gained momentum since the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990. There has been much talk in the Arab press (Jordanian in particular) about reviving the pre-WWI "Greater Syria" concept on an economic monetary and trade level. The EU officials have been making the rounds in the countries and discussing free-trade arrangements.

As well, earlier this year there was a important summit meeting between the Gulf Co-operation Council and the EU. The idea of including the Gulf States in the EU trade zone while allowing for payment of oil in Euro was openly discussed at the summit. I have a hunch that this deal is now basically in play and much oil is being sold in exchange for Euro.

Perhaps the most compelling feature of the Euro is the queaterly mark-to-market of its gold reserves as measured in $US. Once the on-going gold default begins to affect the $US price, it is highly concievable that the Euro could be made fully conertable into gold. This would solidify its use in the Arab speaking world.

On another point, is the Treasury - Budesbank swap the ultimate trap for the US? Perhaps its ultimate maturity is the trigger for the coming hyperinflationay tsunami?

Comment

Sir Belgian,

We have partial evidence that a gold swap between the US and the Bundesbank is considered legal. But no evidence the event occurred.

We have evidence that the Bundesbank has lent and sold some gold. But, their accounting over time does not show any drop of gold stocks larger than expected. Further, their gold lending could have been (and probably was mostly) in "nominee" form for the BIS.

We have evidence that the ESF can do swaps of their currency assets for other's gold. But no evidence that they have attached the West Point gold in exchange for other's gold.

The only "big fish" that was caught (and it is a very big one GATA should be proud of for sure!!) was the actual reclassification at West Point. Truly, this "event" is right in line with our view of current "political actions".

We shall see.

Recession still on the cards
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html

From USAGOLD news feed:

-----Recession still on the cards despite Fed cut----

by ANDREW SMITHERS

The US economy has several problems. Among the most
serious are too much investment and too much debt. The
stock market bubble has been the root cause of both.
Capital has been too cheap.

The Federal Reserve has just cut interest rates, saying it hopes this will encourage more investment. If it does, it must also mean more debt. As the adage has it: 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first
make mad.'

Investment is unlikely to stop falling just because borrowing is cheaper. Companies have invested too much, so there is lots of spare capacity. There is no point, even with lower interest rates, on building more plants. Already, businesses can make more than they can sell.

If investment keeps falling, the outlook for the economy is poor. The big risk is that consumption will also weaken. This would turn a weak economy into a full-blown
recession. ------------------------

Randy, keep up your good work of noting the Fed's money printing! As this recession bites, you may need a full crew to document the cash flow (smile). What a combination;

hyper-inflation,,, cheap contract gold,,,, and exploding prices for physical gold. We just got to see it to believe it!

Comments/Questions on Latest Trail Hike

Hello Parsifal, you write:
--------Me:
If the U.S. held gold in custody for others, and then reneged on the custodial arrangement and denied the rightful claims others had on that gold, that would be outright fraud, theft, no? I expect that theft of gold has been going on since forever.-----------

Sir, We need to remember that most of this "showing off of gold stores, from this point forward will employ a lot of political gamesmanship. Not unlike the BOE auctions. In that case they aren't really selling that much gold into the market. The BIS could have taken it all real easy, but England wanted to drag it out for effect. That way they got the most exposure and time. Allowing some of their favorite BBs to escape before the Pound goes EMU.

In the same light, most of the real gold that has left the CBs ended up in other CBs as statistics show. Political gamesmanship! Same thing is in process with our West Point business. Political jockeying for more mileage. As an example; watch a newcomer ride into town pulling an open
trailer of cash. Every real estate broker from miles around will be at his feet. Now. that cash isn't in their possession, is it? Yet, it sure looks like it's been put on a trailer format for easy spending (grin). Custodial gold has the same effect in international gold paper players. Like these real estate agents, gold players now think they have USA bullion in the bank just because it's been placed in a trailer! (big smile)

Ha! Ha! Forgive me, I am laughing at my own story. My wife hates it when I do that while talking in public.

Parsifal, to more relate to your point; today, it's almost impossible to prove legal intent in the paper gold market. So, whether gold paper is backed or not is not worth asking. It's become so convoluted, the paper trails lose even the BBs. Note: If you want to own gold in storage, forget the
boiler room, leveraged shops that lure you in only to sell you something else. They will only sink with the flood tide that's coming. Deal with a straight, clean operation that traces your ownership in an unbroken line, right to the vault. In allocated storage. I saw the name of one of those dealers just a min ago? Starts with a C.


You write
-----Why do any of the EU CBs lend any of their gold at all? If it is so valuable, why lend it a such low rates (into certain default?) and why are they so anxious to sell it? It seems the sales quotas were met very quickly.------

Go back and read through the archives. We went through a lot of storage space on that one. Even so, we will return to that subject as this all unfolds.

You write my words first , then yours:
------Trail Guide:
Eventually, the US will walk right up to the gold window with the intentions of selling, only to fall away as they stair at a mountain of foreign CB dollars.

Me:
I don't understand this part. Would that be the U.S. govt. doing the selling? What would the U.S.
be selling, physical gold or paper gold? And what would the U.S. be trading for, ????? ----

Sir, It's all just political games, as in my analogy above. We will hear of the US getting ready to sell
as the the end time comes closer.

Sir, you may have hooked a "big one" yourself. Such wording being possible transactions under the ECB umbrella is a prelude to some big time card dealing between the US and ECB. How about a gold for currency swap? US gold for Euros? (smile) Don't laugh too loudly, this may come yet!

-----I feel discouraged right now. Not because the gold price is low, not because of what is happenning in the gold market, and by extension the financial world, but because of the fact that what I see for the future is more of the same.--------

My friend, our message and our position is that we are in one of the most exciting times of all the history of gold! We have seen that during times with the most radical transitions, the majority are usually defending the wrong asset. This unfortunate situation need not impact everyone today. If better judgment is the result of a full understanding, then some who read here will be exposed to
tools that could help them avoid the mistakes of our Western hard money majority.

For Western Gold Bugs today, their culture, their system and their recent knowledge is all ensconced within the last 30 years of paper wealth. Yet they are using a hard money defense, written by masters preceding our modern era. They struggle to use that logic out of context, as it is thought to apply to this gold market today. These two precedents are leading them to reflect their gold values in some form other than physical ownership in possession. This mistaken detour from gold's true purpose will once again prove, by reality, the value of owning real gold.

Standing aside this group is the Physical Gold Advocate. For them, for us, these times will contain the greatest gain in real wealth ever seen. For those who are falling behind, gold is still within your grasp.

Official Gold
Trail : Do agree with your correct observation. And...

Hello again Belgian,
you write:
----------We still remain completely in the dark as WHAT the intensions of the Official Gold-holders (OGH) are !--------

This is always a primary reason to own real gold, in possession. Gold Bugs talk endlessly about how these OGHs cannot forever manipulate the currency price of bullion. Then they go out and place themselves at the mercy of our warring OGHs, by owning gold investments that totally
depend on the OGHs not holding the currency price down.

My friends, wars evolve battles and battles destroy weapons. In this case, the main weapon of the dollar faction is their control of the paper price. As the ECB strikes this stronghold's credibility, that pricing structure of gold will completely fail. Throwing most Gold Bugs into disarray and their investments into valuation uncertainty.

Sir Belgian, I bid you success in your quest for security in physical gold. But disagree in your comment of: ------- We must all realize that there is NOT ENOUGH gold to permit a free market.------

There is enough gold in one ounce to service the entire world's wealth needs. Broken into single atoms and alloyed into coins (MK may agree on this (smile)) that single ounce would work for us all. At the right price, a free price, all the gold owned now could be enough. No more gold would need be mined for the rest of humanities time.

It is the price of gold that has been managed and distorted into a perceived commodity value range. Because gold does not fit into man's credit money systems, man always will attempt to use substitute gold for added supply. Even in a pure gold system, if gold is lent between two humans
they will try to alter the metal's purity to ease the pain of repayment.

http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/gold.htm
since it coincides with the latest discussion regarding subtle changes to verbiage of official gold reporting.

Naturally, you remember we discussed the IMF's late-1999 through early-2000 off-market gold operations conducted with Mexico and Brazil. It seems the IMF, in small degree, capitulated to the better "international practice" of recognizing gold's market value rather than maintaining the arbitrary fictional valuation of SDR35 per ounce.

It now seems that the IMF is *****smoothing the way**** for other future steps in this direction toward recognizing the free gold market value. In March, the IMF changed the language on its website regarding the balance sheet valuation of its gold holdings. Instead of the old proclamation that the majority of its gold was held at SDR35 on the balance sheet, the IMF now states its gold holdings are valued on the balance sheet "on the basis of historical cost".

While this is valuation remains numerically consistent with the prior method due to the original arrival of much of this gold at the SDR35 equivalent "cost", it certainly cracks the door a bit further toward easily and openingly recognizing the higher free market value for gold, and might thus signal full capitulation in this regard all the sooner.

Follow-up on my comment last week that China has lately been a net been seller of silver

------Philip Klapwijk, managing director of GFMS, explained at Monday's conference of the Gold and Silver Institute that China sold near 60 million ounces of silver in 1999, with additional sales of 40 million ounces per year likely over the next couple years. Continuing...----------------

Your words:

--------China is simply lagging by one Century in performing this act. Many of the other nations of the world unleased their silver reserves near the arrival of the 1900's when the usage of silver was abandoned as redundant within the banking sector. And in contrast, not surprisingly, global gold reserves have GROWN since those days. Further, the dollar can be expected to suffer a worse fate than silver when it, too, loses its particular reserve and settlement role within the international banking system. And gold? All reasonable signs show that it shall maintain the king position as THE reserve asset par excellence for a long time to come. Get you some. ------------------

Hello Randy,

You know, your thoughts got me thinking (grin). I have time to do that right now as my files are restored.

Following your chain of thought about China silver,,,, I noticed a comment from Bush that we would fight them over Taiwan. Then silver gets hit real good. Could it be they are unloading silver so as to buy Euros and gold prior to calling it splits with us? They do have more silver than their needs require (possibly more than all of us require).

If they are, indeed, going to run with the Euro later and the ECB is marking gold (not silver) as their main "wealth reserve", then it makes sense for China to position themselves this way. It also makes sense because as an addition, Hong Kong has so many dollar reserves they, too, could never unload them. Following the Euro system lead, they could afford to let their dollar reserves burn as
long as they had even 15% of that value in gold prior to full "Euro roll-in".

Further,
If any EuroZone based gold paper they own that had a US originator defaults, with China's approval, that paper could be restructured to pay back in Euro currency assets. Courtesy of the ECB /BIS. Forcing the US originator to dump dollar based gold hedges (that's a lot of paper gold) as they buy Euro coverage to ensure exchange matching. Of course, extrapolating this system wide, we would see paper gold credibility plunge (therefore it's bid price also) aside the Euro exchange rates spiking on the dollar. All the while out right trade in physical gold or "five day" (super spot delivery) would spike to the heavens.

I do wonder if we are, as I said a number of days ago, seeing history in the making with lease rates doing strange things now? (smile)

Thanks Randy

How do we stop this ages old evolution of "thinning our gold" when our economy slows.

Good thoughts beesting. But aside the daily buying selling using cash (gold coins and gold receipts in your context), how do we default on our borrowed gold? How do we stop the voting public from demanding that our leaders demand of our bankers, that more borrowings be allowed. To cover what we could not pay now? Some extra fiat gold credits, perhaps? Just until we get back on our feet? Does it not always evolve this way? Even during the glory years of the old gold standard?

You see, credit and honesty do not mix well in humankind. Better let the fiat show go on while the average person retains his wealth in Free Gold, no?

Journeyman (04/24/01; 13:39:01MT - usagold.com msg#: 52464)

Mr. Journeyman,
Excellent presentation of your position! Thank you.

The main point I am making about gold and money is directly related to your first statement.

You write:

-------we DON'T need fiat, and neither "the people" nor "society" decided to go from the classical gold standard to FED fiat. That change was foisted on "the people" AND "society" by the banking-government cliques, with the express purpose of profiting these two groups at the expense
of the rest of the population. --------

Absolutely Journeyman. Your articulated account is regarded as an unshakable law amongst our Western hard money crowd. Indeed, it is this very perception that drives the rethinking today about fiat's relationship with gold. That thinking is spelled out in self evident form in this passage from the trail:

"" It's not the management of money that was the problem, it was the management of man's authority to maintain gold and it's discipline. Over and over, we watch good monetary theory fail as society fails to control their controllers.""

This is the root problem we face in advancing another of your classical gold standards. The people could not rebuff the forces that "foisted" the evil upon them. The problem is not deciphering whether someone else did the deed, it is in the understanding that it can and will happen again.
Society nor mankind itself can manage those that can and do these changes for their own gain. This is what we face, this is what we address.

As a further measure of defining and rebuffing this dilemma, I went on to say:

"" The road before us is to not manage gold. Rather, stop (to stop managing) it entirely. Forget about calling it official money and let it seek it's own level against every fiat as a worldly wealth.""

Even if the charge of returning us to a "classical gold standard" was given unconditionally to Sir Journeyman, this person would face all the exact same pressured his predecessors faced. The account of history and our experience with human nature all say he would do no better.

Further, to mitigate the loss all of us experience as this repeats, I made this point:

"" Indeed, while we may never overcome the human failures of war and fiat inflation, the wealth of common man does not have to be expended while society tries yet another time.""

That simple reply, my friend addresses all our experience with moneys.

Also, to your point of:

-------As far as the euro being backed by gold,,,,,,,,,, and But is their currency tied to that gold in any meaningful fiat-supply-limiting way?-----------

We do not in any way consider the Euro gold reserves as being tied to that currency. For the benefit of everyone, gold will be a free priced reserve once the paper dollar forces are cast aside. If the Euro fails, as the dollar has, it will do so in a world where gold in the hands of man will balance the loss. With no incentive to match gold to any form of currency exchange rate, the Euro will for the first time a world reserve that's valued for it's collective management alone.

Thanks

Of Austrians and Arabs

Hello, everyone. Trail Guide, I think I'm beginning to understand finally. Thank you. (smile)

"gold and oil will never flow in the same direction"

A simple statement, but one which I don't think I really grasped until recently. It simply means that as long as Arab oil flows, the Arabs will use that flow, or part of it, to buy gold. As long as Arab oil flows. Be it 10 years, 50 years, 100 years or a thousand.

Being a frugal shopper, the Arab is like us all. He's in the market for the long run, and he's always on the lookout for bargains when he can get them. Today, the Arab, he has a problem though. Everywhere he looks he sees "low gold prices," but, being a big buyer, he finds very little "low-priced gold." It's like a sign in a department store window: $40,000 SONY STEREOS!, TODAY ONLY $270. You go to the counter with your money, but the clerk says "sold out, want a raincheck?" When you say yes, they never call you back. If you complain they'll gladly offer your money back, but you can't sue them for delivery of a $40,000 stereo which doesn't exist, eh? This is the problem the big gold buyers, the Arabs, face today. The world dollar gold markets say "Sale on gold today!" When the big buyer Arab arrives they say, "Sorry, want a raincheck?"

Now all you "Austrians" out there, listen up. I have a sneaking suspicion that Trail Guide, even though he be American, he's a little bit Austrian, too. We Austrians say, "Fiat be bad, gold be good," for all the reasons we, as Austrians, know to be true. But let's lay that aside for the moment and think about what Trail Guide says. After all, he has earned that much from us, no?

As Austrians, we dwell much on mediums of exchange, fiat and government intervention, etc. Let's look deeper, not at the medium of exchange, but the *object* of the exchange.

Leaving aside the medium of exchange we could say that today's worker (us average joes) exchanges his labor for food, shelter, electricity and everything else which he consumes, invests or saves. The Arab trades not labor but oil for all these things. He also consumes, invests and saves, but…..after getting all the Mercedes, palaces, common stocks and what not that he can use, there's still more oil to be exchanged. He exchanges that for gold.

But wait! Didn't Elwood just say he's going to leave the medium of exchange out of this? Gold is certainly a medium of exchange, history says so anyway. But the Arab is thinking differently. To him gold *is* the object of the exchange, not unlike your house to you. The gold is the object of the exchange to him, not a medium in the way we think of fiat or in the way we think of a gold medium.

You would have to be pretty hard up (hungry?) to be forced to trade your house. Why? Because you have your labor. Likewise, he would have to be pretty hard up to be forced to trade his gold. Why? Because he has oil.

To him, gold is a medium of exchange, but only in the same way that your house is a medium of exchange to you.

We trade every day for bigger and better houses, but, for the Arab, is there a "bigger and better" gold? (If you said "silver," you get the booby prize. (smile)) Yes, thinking like this, he would have to be very hard up indeed to be forced to sell gold. The Arab is correct to think this way, for there is nothing in the world he cannot buy today with his oil……except gold.

Think, there are people in the world today who have become so rich…..who have become so wealthy, that gold (to us, a medium of exchange) has become the *object* of their exchange. Hard for us common folk to imagine, isn't it? Trail Guide's task be large, no?

Ok, let's toss back in the role of money now. Let's get to the fiat! We Austrians say gold be the best medium, history says this, no? Yes, history does say this, but there be no oil in history! History says (at various times) more people need cows than need trinkets, so cows best medium. Then more people need wheat than need cows, so wheat better medium. Then world becomes richer and people say this wheat different than other wheat, and this cow different than other cow, so use gold as "standard" or "benchmark" medium even though no one "needs" it.

Today oil is a better medium, because ALL people need oil (even more than need cows and wheat), and oil "standard" is good enough. Gold returns to luxury, "wealth" item as second-best to oil. And silver? She be a base industrial metal, tarnished with age.

Oil is the best medium, but can't buy a diet soda and Doritos with oil (too inefficient), so Arab agrees to use fiat as long as fiat creators keep gold price reasonable (gold is object of their exchange, remember?).

Today, Dollar gold price very reasonable, but where is gold? Tomorrow, Euro gold price still reasonable and there be gold.

Austrians say "Gold trade next to fiat? Fiat will die!" I think now, this Euro trade next to gold and survive……if Arab agrees.

Austrians say "Why not force direct trade: gold for oil?" I think, then gold price in oil not be reasonable. It be too high.

When Arab well runs dry or oil's timeline be ended by technology, on that day Arab wake and wish for higher gold price, because then he becomes seller.

What say you, Austrians?

Keep'n 'em honest @Trail Guide msg#: 52540

Hello again Journeyman,

Your comment on my question to Econoclast was an excellent example of the mind set I have been pointing out. It seems that with each step up the ladder of economic sophistication, we also perceive a need for a more sophisticated way of using our money. It is here, at this nondescript moment in the minds of men that we always attempt to combine receipt forms with wealth forms.
Throughout history, each one of these new ideas were embraced as a way that was sure to undo the prior problems. Each time the wealth of common man, his life long savings, is risked and then squandered once more as the world tries to make gold something it isn't.

It always starts off as a fine idea, a reasonable method, a way to better define our security of wealth and surety of payment. With each invention and improvement to our economic lot comes a better way to use gold without giving up any of it's historic principles. Principles of wealth form that
serve us by not cheating us. All done as we proclaim that "us humans" would conform to not cheat these principles in exercising this new process. Such a proclamation is repeated relentlessly until the ears of countless generations become numb from poorness without real wealth.

Truly, as mentioned on the GoldTrail, the money of our ancient fathers was not money unless it was wealth and it was not wealth unless it was possessed. Yes,,,,,,,, that one law of money that so convolutes our souls today as we struggle to contrive a way around such an unsophisticated rule of common sense. As surely as breath and air complete the circle of life, gold in hand, underrepresented by a claim, is the money we children have never known.

---------------------

Sir, you write (condensed for space):

------I think I know how the baser human tendencies ---------------------------------- with the
added advantages modern technology makes possible. We may perhaps best begin this particular trail with the French paper money experiment -----------------"To reach the climax of ferocity, the Convention decreed, in May 1794, that the death penalty should be inflicted on any person convicted of 'having asked, before a bargain was concluded, in what money [assignats or specie (gold and silver)] payment was to be made.' The great finance minister, Cambon, soon saw that the
worst enemies of his policy were gold and silver. Therefore it was that, under his lead, the Convention closed the Exchange and finally, on November 13, 1793, under terrifying penalties, suppressed all commerce in the precious metals." -Andrew Dickson White, Fiat Money Inflation In France ----
--------Simple self-interest caused the French people to discount the paper assignats vs. the precious metals, so much that the "authorities" had to attempt to drive gold and silver out of the market places in a vain attempt to save this their latest paper scheme. It took the French about 10
years, door-to-door to clear things up and get back on honest gold. In fact, Napoleon was the follow-up to that paper experiment, and he fought most of his major battles financed directly by gold. You see, history is _not_ the paper context punctuated by sporadic honest hard money we all assume because we've all lived in the midst of the paper. It is rather, honest hard money punctuated by relatively short bouts of shakey paper money. --------------

Sir,
This account is but one portion of the story. The corruption of wealth did not begin or end with this moment in time. Walk backwards from 1794 and view the context as it is punctuated with debasement of the metal itself in between and before these bouts of shaky paper. A search of our
manuals will indeed pinpoint the exact time when gold the money wealth became the object of wars and revolutions. That year was when man decided to combine the wealth concept of gold with the credit concept within him. From that moment on gold began it's troubles.

Now, walk only a short step forward from the French period as they strive a resolution of their money problems. Here we see where it all began again, even into this day.

You write:
----- It's our misfortune to be near the tail-end of the latest and most wide-spread paper experiment in history. So far, in pure form, it's lasted only about three times as long as the ten-year French experiment 200 years ago. It's longer because it's more wide- spread.---------------

Sir,

The British before us were lending and printing credits long before the US learned how. We should not judge their gold period a sucess either. Just because they brought the world a long period of gold based money did not hide their inflation. Political styling, as it were then, demanded a constant search for subjects so as to steal through warfare that gold they did not have. Inflationary expansion
through expropriated gold is inflation by any means necessary and the same mind would print for the same purpose, if needed to achive a political end. Hard money historians would have us think the King would not have printed gold receipts if he had no gold. When gold is money, it will be inflated by a society unable to controll their controllers.

You write:

----- It's a little different this time. Things are daunting for other reasons, but the out-come will be the same, reinstitution of transactional gold.-------------------

--------TG, you already know gold shines as the premier wealth preserver. If title to it can be transferred securely and easily from person-to-person, it once-again becomes the odds-on favorite for the inflation-proof transactional medium it has always been. It's the very fact of the ease of
electronic transfer of title made possible by the internets, combined by the legendary advantages of gold money that nearly guarantees this outcome.--------------

Sir,
I do not consider gold as a wealth preserver. Nor does any other Physical Gold Advocate. We consider gold itself as wealth. Indeed, "odds-on favorites" you say? Our history is full of new forms of paper receipts that would better work as the transactional medium of their day. As I told ET and
others on the Trail, man cannot control his controllers, nor can he discipline fiat with gold.

To young ears, (and I know Another will smile while reading all this) this speed of electronic transfer sounds like new news. Yet, with each new form of paper currency came the next generation of faster settlement. None of these advancements, including your latest item, addresses how it will avoid the political stress such systems face during downturns, crisis and war. As the turn of these events is marked, so to is the national money also marked. The cry goes out, if fiat is our money, we must borrow it. And if gold is our money we will borrow that too. We will make money as needed!

While it's true that all wealth is appropriated during crisis for the good of all, anything that is fiat and
receipt in nature is inflated the worst. Your "electronic gold" is nothing new in function, only new in promotion. It will succumb to the same human faults all gold receipts fall into, greed, corruption and paper inflation. No matter the safeguards in place. The Physical Gold Advocate moves forward in modern times to use and embrace the same fiat society will tamper with. All the while owning the wealth of ages as the ancients did, in your possession. In this way, the average family will know their wealth is real while society at large fights their historic war with man's credit money.

Thank You all

Cavan Man,
Thank you for your comments on our discussions here. You mentioned that I was a class act,,,,,,, Well, you should see the look in my wife's eyes when our large dinner functions conclude with a silent room and me talking about politics. HO! Ho! No thoughts of class in those eyes! (grin)

LeSin and Lafisrap,
Speaking of eyes,,,,,,, at our G7 coming up,,,,the ECB will be getting a case of the dry eye (no blinking) while everyone else in the house is crying! I'll do my part to console them in their hour of "transition". (smile)

Journeyman,
OK, my friend,,,,, you have made your case and I mine. Now we watch this all unfold and weigh the evidence. By the way, didn't the electronic gold companies have a major problem making any market at all after the Washington Agreement? I think MK or Randy may have commented on that item because customers were complaining that E-Gold (or one of these) couldn't buy or sell for a while. Funny, there was a 24/7 market for my gold during all this. (big smile while digging for old bones) Natural for me because I do a lot of digging for,,,,, old gold,,,,,, gardening and,,,, peoples
perceptions and intentions.

Thanks all

China Gold!
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html

From the USAGOLD News Feed (see link above):

Parts of article -----

China to Reform Gold Management System

------China is going to abolish its planned management system for the unified purchase and distribution of gold and to set up a gold market in its stead, said Dai Xianglong, governor of People's Bank of China.------------

----------For a long time, China has instituted the planned management system featuring "unified management, purchase and distribution"---------------- the problem featuring the lack of pressure and vigor for gold production and operation brought about by planned management has become increasingly conspicuous and has, to some degree, hindered the further development of the industry in gold production, processing and sales. It is therefore imperative to reform this system. ----------

--------Dai said that the basic ideas in reforming the system are: to set up a !!!!! gold market !!!!! to replace the aforesaid planned management system-----------

--------The main contents include: first, to cancel planned management of gold. set up a gold swap market in Shanghai ---------in the form of a membership system ----------

(MY NOTE: Not to be confused with a paper ownership swap in the context of our recent discussions)

---- Second, to abolish the licensing management system for the business such as retail, wholesale, processing and management. ------ Third, to relax control on !!!gold imports !!! in light of the process of !!!!! foreign exchange system reform!!!!. ----

(My Note: Don't you just wonder what they mean by that? Almost makes one think that someone,,, somewhere,,,, has decided to use gold in a different context. Almost like using it as a wealth reserve asset that's market to the market every three months. Strange, though, there is no
mention of a "redundant" (thanks Randy (smile)) metal helds as this asset???)

-----Currently, the People's Bank of China is actively carrying out various items of preparatory work in line with the general arrangements for the reform of the gold management system---------

----- it will start up the gold quotation system as quickly as possible, formally carry out the purchase and distribution of gold; it will intensify efforts to adjust the current gold management policy, to ensure that the gold retail business license system is abolished in the first half of this year. ----------

Ok,,,,, looks like they are moving towards the "big Bang" coming in the second half. Come to think of it, the EMU is making plans to circulate currency at the end of the 2nd half??? It's time for me to talk to a few friends. later

Hello again!

Had some interesting conversations with a few friends recently. I'll try to convey those talks into a trail walk this weekend. Another sent me a letter and has offered a new reply post to the forum. I intend to convey that letter and his letter also. As a change, we are going to post his Thoughts on the Gold Trails page.

Now that my computer is finally back up to speed, will begin replies and comments to some of the great posts offered here a few days ago. Will return tomorrow!

Hello Michael and everyone!

Oh yes, I not only would get in on this but think I am "in it" up to the old arm pits already (smile). This world of ours is changing fast these days.

Actually, I only just now had time to copy several days worth of the Forum for reading. I'm late to my own invitation here, I know,,,,,,,, but as they say,,,, better late than never! I took the time to finish several things so as to clear up my writing schedule. Have a lot to say and reply to,,,, and this coming week will be very, very free. Oh yes,,,, one other thing,,,,, ET,,,, did you (or anyone here) ever drink in the "monkey bar" in central Oahu (Hawaii)? I know it's long gone now,,,, but there was something up on the roof of that place that you may be interested in. Much more interesting than that huge jungle cage of monkeys behind the bartender. (big grin)

OK everyone,,,,, I'll be back here as soon as I unpack and take care of some things,,,, then it's time for some real give and take.

A Tree in the Making

Hello everyone!

Let's gather around and begin with a talk first, then an extended hike. I'm sorry to be so late and am also happy you didn't decide to start without me (smile)!

It's good to see so many familiar faces. It looks like the whole forum is here! There is MK with his warm cup,,,, Randy away from his tower,,,, and Mr Gresham who is just back from a historic visit to the "The Pearl City Tavern". His visit there (see #53150) was in response to my recent return post [#53119]. More on that in a moment.

I brought something with me today, as an example of human foresight. Yes, this fine ancient rosewood Bonsai tree. It's one of a collection I own and is quite old. Some of you may have already experienced these "works in progress" at The Bonsai National Arboretum in Washington DC.. Or perhaps you traveled to Elandan Gardens (in Bremerton, Washington State), where Dan Robinson has collected and displayed some of the oldest Bonsai known. Indeed, he has collected them from all over the world! They are priceless.

It's important, for our talk today, to understand the difference between many of the Elandan Garden ancients and most of those at traditional museums. Mr. Robinson retrieved many of his specimens from mountain tops after they had been growing for hundreds and hundreds of years. Untouched by man's hand, they formed most of their shapes by fate of nature long before Dan found them. The more traditional Bonsai, started by people, were formed and trained from birth. Hence, their more standard styling.

So,,,,, what does all this have to do with the old "Monkey Bar" at the Pearl City Tavern? The same bar that our Mr. G just paid a mental visit to? Well, many years ago I was there for wine and dinner. The place was rumored to be a hangout for spies and international intrigues, but I didn't
happen upon any (smile). Later in the evening, I was taken up on the roof and given a private tour of their Bonsai collection. One tree, in particular, was a spectacular item that had been passed through over ten generations of Japanese lineage. It was here, on the roof of the Monkey Bar, that I first began to understand how societies endeavor to manage the events of life yet never fully control it's outcome. And further, it seems the difference between great leaders and simple manipulators is perfectly demonstrated in the art of Bonsai.

The blatant controller will twist and turn, cut and destroy,,,, in an effort to replicate an image he has seen in the past. The beautiful landscape scene he remembers as perfect,,,,, all good and all right for himself and perhaps society at large; this system he strives to repeat as the bonsai grows. In the end,,,, he fails,,,, unable to reproduce what once was. Killing the system,,,, the tree,,,, the old currency. The very thing he and we all wanted so much to grow.

But, greatness is within those that know life is dynamic,,,,, what we do is never certain and subject to the leadership of nature. That person will spin the Bonsai on a table for hours, days, and even years as he styles what will work for that period of growth,,,, perhaps planning the timeline in a currencies development. A cut here,,,,, a change there as time grows the next limb. In the process creating something we all recognize, can use, understand and enjoy,,,,, yet,,,, different in many ways from what we knew or saw before.

Onward a bit

Thank you Michael, for your outstanding post today (#53135). I suspect, my friend, you have always raced before the wind! Perhaps a fine example for others to see as they drag anchor on the rocky bottom of history. It's sometimes good to seek safe harbor, I know, but this time the prize will go to those that outrun the storm (smile).

I see that our poster ET has gone away for a golf trip. Too bad, I wanted to remind him to be sure to bring plenty of currency along to pay his travel expenses (grin). In this world we all need much; blessings from above,,,,, family,,,, home,,, friends and good health. But after all that, one must have currency and an enduring, tradable wealth asset that places our footing in life on equal ground with the giants around us,,,,,, gold! Understanding the events that got us here and how they will unfold before us is what this GoldTrail is all about. Everyday our political world is pruned like two Bonsai, in an effort to shape a more healthy future. The dollar tree is failing because it needs so much dead wood cut off,,,,,, but if it is pruned it will not resemble the mighty Bonsai it once was! The Euro tree is growing as it is being styled,,,,,, what it will look like we have an idea,,,, but not a complete picture. It's hard to imagine that anyone can look at an early Bonsai and shape it's future some 20 years out? But, that is exactly what someone did with a tree on the roof of the Monkey Bar in Hawaii; indeed, this is what has been in process for so long with our changing money system.

OK, it's late for me and I plan on walking for some time this trip. So, let's camp here and rest. There is more trail ahead.

Thanks

A Tree in the Making #02

Well good morning everyone!

Waking up on the trail is always a great experience. Our thoughts are fresh and the air is clear. Indeed, clarity is something that us real Gold Advocates are now fully experiencing in these latter days. Over a fresh cup of coffee, we can look around and for the first time begin to place the GoldTrail landscape in proper perspective. A perspective that breaks the old illusions of gold's paper worth and replaces it with an understanding of it's coming dynamic value as real wealth.

Down the trail,,,,

gold will no longer be able to successfully carry the Western name of Money so as to allow for it's political price fixing. A process that, it seems, has been with us for generations. Enslaving millions of hard workers by always officially classifying the terms and value of both their paper currency and their metal savings. Always inflating both items for the good of society's never ending political agenda. Then, never allowing Another currency to command an equal reserve position so as to engage and weigh the motivations of more than one political arena. Engaging and weighing these fiats not just within the exchange rate function, but additionally against the real wealth function of gold. (see MK's post below)

Allowing FreeGold to circulate as a wealth asset would denominate it's true worth through the much larger real demand of "Wealth Possession" instead of paper possession. Such a gold scale would measure our world reserve currencies against each other instead of against our Western concept of gold as official money. But, in addition, on a more higher level, prevent any one country from subjugating other nation states through fiat dominance. To more fully grasp the impact of "Possession" and why ancient gold was worth so much more as FreeGold; hike again that part of our trail (FOA (04/18/01; 20:20:06MT - usagold.com msg#64) Lombards, Normans and Franks.)

Both as official wealth and private wealth, physical gold will march with us into a future at values the likes of which we have never known. Understanding the how and why this would all come about took time and personal reasoning for each of us to sort through. Much of our background building would not have been possible without this modern internet. Further, without the fine folks at CPM, this unfolding story would not have been defined in mass, for all to see. Events now slowly build the story on their own as we become ever more secure holding physical gold for the acts that will follow.

Onward a bit:

I'm handing out these reprints of two important explanations of what we have meant and the perception that has been created. These are perceptions built upon not only our ongoing discussions and hikes here but also the refining input of the thousands that walk with us on the USAGOLD forum. Below defines their authors take on Another's thrust. I would say they are very much on the mark. First, from Randy at the Tower (USAGOLD sitemaster):

-----------
Randy (@ The Tower) (04/17/01; 13:37:02MT - usagold.com msg#: 52046)
Mr Gresham, nice question (msg#: 52041) --- "Was the Washington Agreement the most significant event in gold since you were last posting in 1998?"---

If I may be so bold, let me anticipate ANOTHER's answer with an answer of my own.

The most significant event in gold since the dollar's gold default in 1971 has been the successful launch in 1999 of a long-awaited new currency system built upon neutral (meaning, multi-national) management and, more importantly, a floating gold reserve structure that finally abandoned the now obsolete "fixed" gold legacy of the failed Bretton Woods structure.

With this new reserve structure, the prevailing institutional incentive -- from '71 to the end of the millennium -- need no longer be one of "price suppression" for the perceived market value of gold.

In this light, the most significant element of the Washington Agreement is seen to be NOT the amount of pre-announced gold sales, but rather, the self-imposed curb on gold lending operations by these European central banks. And if you think about it, this action with the Washington Agreement was nearly just a predictable inevitability from the moment the eurosystem committed to provide for freely floating gold reserves. The "tools" of the prior suppression are on the outs. Believe it. The WA simply announced the foregone conclusion in a package suitable for newspaper headlines.

Just as the value of the post-'71 paper dollar has long been propped by the international yet artificial "mandate" to hold these dollars almost exclusively as reserves (acting in tandem with the dollar settlement for oil and the overhanging debts of the "Third World"), through this new currency structure gold (and its price/value!) has now been "officially" set free to replace these dollar reserves (savings).

The reason this full transition has not already occurred is that institutional interest still exists to foster the smoothest practicable transition until that unknowable moment where the final remaining *SNAP* in the adjustment occurs.

Speaking for The Tower and personally, I continue to buy gold with excess funds because I prefer the real wealth of gold over managed paper (and digital) contract currency. As a bonus, the real wealth value of same gold will provide a pleasant benefit upon full completion of the transition in world currencies' reserve structures. (An understatement, to be sure.)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely, Sir Randy!

As clear as mountain air. Next, the most recent treatise from USAGOLD (who is this guy? smile):

--------------------
USAGOLD (05/06/01; 09:48:35MT - usagold.com msg#: 53135)
ET et al. . . .On Currency Competition Quote from ET:
Randy asked me the other day what I thought about the "suffering" that has been caused by the US currency hegemony. Why do you think he would ask this? My guess is that he believes great suffering has come to pass and I certainly agree with him. However, he then goes on to say we should adopt another version of the same thing, apparently so the suffering can be spread around a bit. ---------
I have spent more than a small amount of time analyzing and interpreting the Another/FOA message, and I think you have reduced their message to a very narrow interpretation that falls short of of the mark. The statement above is indicative. As a result, I thought I should comment on the subject because I think you've missed a great deal of their message. I hope to add to your thinking as well as to others who may have fallen into the same misreading of their analysis. The danger in this sort of thing as always is that I may not be saying things with which FOA and Another agree, but I think my recapitulation accurate and if I'm missing something, I hope the other participants will fill in the gaps. I will not comment beyond this on this subject, because, as always, I am sensitive to playing too large a role here at this esteemed table. Those who are bored with this sort of thing, I beg your indulgence. Those who revel in it, I think you will find much to chew on. . . .per below.

Onward. . . . .

You and Randy are correct in pointing to dollar hegemony as a source of much suffering in the world -- intended or not. In fact President Bush has expressed the same reservations, more or less in a backhanded way, in his criticisms of the IMF during the campaign. So none of us are alone on those concerns. I think however that you need to expand your understanding of what Another/FOA are trying to convey, because it is not a simple advocacy of the euro over the dollar -- but a much deeper and important advocacy of competition in currencies, much as we have competition in other realms within the economy. This lack of competition is the problem with dollar hegemony and makes it possible for New York based multi-nationals and international banks to make bad (non-repayable) loans in the third world and then turn around and impose stringent conditions through the IMF that strap the local economy and eventually send the people into the streets -- ala Indonesia a year ago -- agitating for "economic" justice. (And of course that's just one example of the excesses of a monolithic reserve currency) Years ago, such injustices would have been fertile ground for Communist agitators, but now with the fall of the Soviet Union perhaps the multi-national crowd has been unjustifiably emboldened. In the long run, competition for this market from Europe, with an agenda of its own, would be good for the dollar and the international economy as well as the U.S. and Europe, and therein lies the real thrust of the FOA/Another analysis.

Let me take this a bit deeper:

I do not believe that Another/FOA are advocating a fiat euro which would "replace" in toto the dollar. Instead they advocate the euro, dollar and gold should "compete" for the hearts and minds of ordinary people (in terms of the currency they employ to store wealth), important financiers (as a hedging methodology), and, yes, central banks and nation states (as a reserve asset). In the case of nation states, the competition would inherently create circumstances leading to each doing what is necessary to make their "reserve" better than the other "reserves."

Under such a regime, the importance of gold ownership, for nation states, as well as individuals, would not be diminished because any nation state is capable of dalliance along the road to currency inflation making it necessary for the other participants to "hedge" their holdings. It is in fact a novel concept built closer to the von Hayek foundation of competing currencies -- including gold -- than possibly your own reliance on a gold standard as the ultimate and only magic dart that will find the target's center.

In fact there is a danger there that you might have overlooked. Take for instance the widely disseminated Kemp/Polyconomics New Bretton Woods proposal of a gold standard being bandied about in the conservative press. That proposal pegs the price of gold at $300. A major problem quickly surfaces: Whatever's left of the U.S. gold supply would disappear completely within six months of posting the $300 price -- the work of Continental Europe begun in the 1960s/1970s will have been fully rendered. The danger of course is the gold standard you would like to see is not remotely connected to the gold standard others, more politically inclined would like to see, so you always end up with this warmed-over version of a gold standard that gets right back where we started.

As a matter of fact, I see the FOA/Another currency concept as closer to the tenets of libertarianism (and Jefferson) than a gold standard because of the exchange restrictions which inevitably follow. In other words, we would very well be right back in 1971 with the United States once again facing the prospect of shipping its gold reserve to Japan and Europe in defense of the over-produced dollar. (Unless of course, the price were set at something like $3000 to $5000 per ounce -- then you might have some equilibrium.) Idealistically the gold advocate would most certainly would like to see a gold exchange standard -- but at what price and what would be the economic consequences if it were to be set where it should be? Polyconomics offers up this
arbitrary $300 price because it wouldn't break the current international system, but when it comes to real political/economic policy ideals and practical reality often clash. It's always nice to hear someone like Jack Kemp speak glowingly of gold, but before we roll over and cast adoring glances at the politician perhaps we should better understand what the politician is actually stumping for, and in the Kemp/Polyconomics case it is more currency hegemony under the guise of a free international gold standard, a hegemony paid for by the American people in the form of its gold reserve.

Currency hegemony is precisely the opposite of competition -- it is, in fact, the imposition of a currency, even gold (at a stated currency price, of course), on the population. As such the euro is important in that it challenges that hegemony, and does so with the key concept of utilizing gold as a "currency without a country" to act as a reserve for interventions if required -- a breakthrough. Re-read Mundell on this. You and I and the rest of this forum could be talking about the need for a gold standard now, tomorrow, the day after that and for all the days remaining in both our lives, and I do not believe we will be any closer to its imposition then than we are now -- thanks to the wayward and half-baked thinking on the part of some of the very gold "advocates" who are supposed to understand economic history well enough to anticipate some of the consequences. In
other words, the gold standard probably isn't going to happen. In the meanwhile, practically speaking, the best option is for all of us, including the various nation states to own gold as a talisman against our own worst instincts.

If Randy is concerned about hegemony and its effect on various populations, I don't think it's because he would like to replace that same hegemonic error with another. I think he agrees with FOA/Another that competition paves the road to a better international monetary system. I do believe, as FOA/Another do, that with the euro we are talking about the currency of the future here, and I believe that the dollar will eventually be modeled after the euro. Not only that, I believe we are talking about, not just the currency of the future, but the international monetary system of the future -- for what its worth. Sometimes the world heads off in a direction even if we don't want it to.

Once again I'll reiterate what PH hinted at in his post: For most investors the world over, the ownership of gold is a pragmatic undertaking, and what FOA/Another are advocating is a practical, hands-on solution for the average investor -- personal gold ownership. I think Randy agrees with this position, as do I. I can envision private gold ownership as a necessity even under a gold standard -- because there is little doubt in my mind that if the government were to undertake a gold standard even under the best intentions, with Lewellyn Rockwell serving as Chairman of the Fed, it eventually would botch the whole scheme -- politics being what it is. (By the way, I can't imagine a currency regime at this late date that would allow only the circulation of specie. Therefore, you will always have various derivatives in circulation along with the government largesse, currency printing, tinkering with the gold price which threatens the value of the paper. Gresham rules.)

In the end, he who owns the gold, makes the rules. And it is the personal ownership of it that will carry the day on a practical level while governments will do, well ...... governments will do what governments do.
--------------------------------

Ha! Ha! Now, that was good! What chance do us poor hikers have against a mountain climber like that? Legs like tree trunks and a mind the size of Bolder (Colorado?). (grin)

My friends, think carefully about these while I go over to see what Econoclast dug up on the trail. I asked him a question on 04/25/01 usagold# 52540 and I think he found something! A little later today we will continue the hike as I address the views above. Even later, I will post Another's latest Thoughts here on the Trail. Events are unfolding and it seems the BIS is thinking of making some changes.

A Tree in the Making #03

Across the high pass,,,,,

The other day I came upon Econoclast working the Trail. After asking him to define what his actions would be to defend a modern gold standard, he replied and his answer hit some gold! My initial #52540 request in summary was: ---- How do we stop this ages old evolution of "thinning our gold" when our economy slows?---------

Hello Econoclast,
I'm going to take parts of your find and comment on it out of sequence. You write in #52646:
------Any system that could possibly be thought of or proposed must include the use of law. Part of the answer (transparency) includes a complete treatise of the "new" laws written in simple, direct English (8th grade level-2 pages instead of 2000). The laws would be directed towards controlling the bankers, not the people for a change. The laws would be written with input from bankers, but not by bankers. Penalties for financial fraud/counterfeiting/etc. would be severe. ---------------------------------This new gold dollar system would function alongside the current FED system. Any large debts (mortgages, business debt, most importantly, govt debt) would be denominated in fiat dollars. That way govt could continue to operate (maybe, ha ha) and the banksters could still have their play money to manipulate and try to capitalize on. A free market would exist to redeem back and forth as necessary. This free market would show the relative worth between the two currencies. ---------------
===================
Excellent thought sir. Econoclast, using your thrust as my platform:

One of the major problems faced by past hard money planers was that any time real wealth, gold, is denominated as credit money, it always placed the relationship between the rule of law and the rule of gold at odds. If our laws defined gold as official money, and lent it, then by association the law had to define a portion of gold that did not exist in circulation. That portion was the contract asset held as bank savings. Yet, a person's claims against it identified said gold as real. This was and is an inherent contradiction because no law can define the value of real wealth held in contract.

This particular fiat form of hard money owed it's existence upon a continuous function of the economy. What the above means is that you cannot take something real and lend it over and over, as banks do when lending fiat, and still demand that the law recognize said contract moneys as hard legal tender.

I would state that no form of lent gold be recognizable or enforceable in the court of law as a legal tender contract. One may borrow gold, relend it, or even borrow against it, but that gold would not be valid in the payment of all debts both public or private. It could not, by law be legal tender. This is not to say the trading of gold would not somewhat supplant currency in function. It could and most likely would to a degree, but it would no longer carry a credit quality that fiat would in the form of a time function. Indeed, in our modern economic structure, a credit time function is very valuable and gives digital contract currencies their demand.

To deal in the future,,,,, to borrow,,,,, to capitalize would require the use of a fiat function. Gold could / would be a final trade; I'll give you ten cars (or gold) for your house,,, deal done. If I want more time to pay, I and we must engage a fiat loan.

==========
You write:
-------weaving OUR gold supply, literally, into gold dollars--------Contracts could be denominated in gold dollars, however these "gold notes" are strictly non-transferable. If someone wants to sell their gold note, they can't. It is only enforceable between the parties that entered into it originally. All forms of paper gold are illegal-fraudulent. Any debt larger than the legal tender law amount has to be denominated in fiat, smaller can be negotiated.------------
Well sir,
Once again, it looks good at first but later evolves. By mingling your gold currency into the contract / credit realm, it once again creates gold loans that are at odds with human nature. Yes, the gold notes may not be transferable, but the lent gold currency is. It is at once someone's asset while also another's liability. The gold currency in circulation expands thru the nature of loans. When these loans fail on a national scale (major downturn) the legal tender laws defining our new gold currency will be changed. We thin our gold again in an ages old cycle aimed at covering debts that are the common citizen's savings.

Still, we are not far from the position you see. We must remember that neither currencies or gold define society's economy. Business can function using fiat alone. We have been doing just that for a number of decades. Installing a trading medium outside lawful money that acts as a wealth savings and a final trade will not destroy the bankers, governments or paper credit inflation. But, it will allow society a way to judge political efficiency. A nation's productivity will then have two scales to measure with, one it must live with (final payment) and another it cannot live without (future payment).

We shall see (smile)

Thanks for digging deep

A Tree in the Making #04

Sun's up, time to move:

We have covered a lot of ground and this framework, when viewed in context, helps explain much of what has happened with gold over the last twenty or thirty years. Even more so over the decade of our 90s.

Many hard money investors drifted with this evolution, right into it's most volatile decade. Thinking they were part of a much more efficient, changing, paper marketplace. A market that was utilizing all the modern trading system in order to not only advance gold perception but add profits to their accounts. It's been a painful mistake for many.

Our modern gold market and the price illusion it creates, is little more than a fiat dollar system that denominates gold credits in contract form. Is it a free market? Why yes, very free. But only free in the sense that supply is unlimited. Investors and the industry in total, brought into paper based gold and yet they fully well knew 90% of it had only cash equity as the collateral on the other side. Then, somehow expected that those contracts were limited in creation by the fixed amount of gold in the world. Their mistake, not the markets.

Clearly, anyone schooled in classic hard money Thought should have known that this was but Another inflation, a transitory era between systems. This was a time to gather gold over years, not invest in the leveraged aspects of gold's new fiat versions. Nor, to buy into the gold industry that owed it's life and cash profits to the maintenance of such a system, transitory as it was.

Onward,,,,,

In USAGOLD #53135 (see earlier), the perception was stated that; -------As such the euro is important in that it challenges that hegemony (my note: dollar's), and does so with the key concept of utilizing gold as a "currency without a country" to act as a reserve for interventions if required -- a breakthrough. --------
=========

Indeed,
a currency without a country! In order to implement such a currency, gold would require laws that would keep it within it's wealth concept. Gold in possession would be wealth in possession as long as governments could not use it as credit money. In my discussion with Econoclast, I took his legal meanings and applied them to this "wealth without a country" position.

Keeping gold out of the fiat arena would be more simple than many hard school advocates envision. The key to that is found in the implementation of international law. The leading economic countries (EuroZone in the future) would have but to establish a protocol that forbid the enforcement of collateral attachment anytime physical gold is traded, lent or involved in a trade. In this context, no banker would lend you gold to buy a house if, in a default, he could not claim your house in a court of law. Even private parties would never lend gold if the asset behind the loan could not be claimed for nonpayment. It's that simple. With a stroke of written law, the trading of gold as wealth would become a final payment with no possible credit implications. Our official fiats and wealth without a country would never again function as one.

When USAGOLD went further to say that; ------that competition paves the road to a better international monetary system. I do believe, as FOA/Another do, that with the euro we are talking about the currency of the future here, and I believe that the dollar will eventually be modeled after the euro. Not only that, I believe we are talking about, not just the currency of the future, but the international monetary system of the future -- for what its worth.----------------

Yes Michael, this future is before us. As hard money advocates, I think we failed ourselves by falling out of the loop of economic evolution. Truly, we have circled the earth and now return to our roots. Only, once unearthed after all these years we cannot recognize them.

We lost our ability to advance with the advances,,,,,, to grasp that ours is a credit society compared to none before. Even the world's gold dealers operate on credit,,, on loan,,,, on fiat! It's our accepted way of life,,,,, to function within this era,,,, as loans both personal and official live and fail. We gamble,,,, we bet,,,, we play at life. Sometimes suffering the loss, no matter the gain.

We are no less than the citizens of Rome, only they knew how to keep their wealth aside the "games people play". They understood the "possession of gold"!

Further on we walk,,,,,,

Within this perception we can separate the actions of goldbugs and gold advocates. Western goldbugs strive to fix the current system. They hasten to make right the paper markets that have failed their gold industry investments. In doing as much, they push for a return to a status quo that never existed, failing to see that this past decade was but a passing,,,,,, an evolution,,,,, a transition that started long ago. I doubt Gata will ever see the end they seek as our gold market will fail sooner rather than "in time" for their legal resolution. They fight a good, worthy fight and call needed attention to the situation. But fail to "seize the moment" by clinging onto the past. The gold industry is lost as time and marches past. As events transpire, gold in the ground will be of less importance to common man and officials alike that gold on the surface. Gold will be produced, but it will be a far less profitable experience than our future gold price will dictate. Truly, it's a gamble no different than guessing the future of dollar fiat. Perhaps a small win, but more likely a large loss.

The future a Gold Advocate seeks is not found in Euros, Dollars or just gold. Rather it's found in understanding the Euros impact on the dollar's value and how that will change the gold markets,,, forever! The political motivation in all of this is the show of the century and worthy of our respected attention. Even now, the oil card we have discussed for so long is changing our dollar way of life and quickening it's fall. As seen in the Black Blade chronicles. Was this connected to the planning for gold and Euros? You bet, grasp it or no, we will feel it's full effects later.

Onward, my friends, this trail is only just now becoming extremely interesting. Truly, the ownership of physical gold will make this trip even more so,,,,,, perhaps even,,,, fun? (smile)

Comment

Hello ALL,

ORO made some interesting comments and I want to take issue with a few of them. I'll start with his first post. (also, a big welcome back to you sir!)

In your post ORO (5/9/01; 11:40:43MT - usagold.com msg#: 53294) FOA - NO LAW,,,,,,,,,,,

you write:

--------My take on Europe and the Euro are that they are desperate attempts to save European governments from competition among each other and the rest of the world, and of their trying to maintain the political hegemony of the small bureaucratic and political elite within Europe.------

No ORO, that view does not hold water. Europe, along with imput from many other non dollar nation states, has been working on currency union from the most early days of the "European Economic Unit (EEU). That one thrust alone dates back into the early 70s and even before that they have tried to match their economies by presenting united exchange rate mechanisms.

If their current objective is the object of a desperate attempt, you will have a hard time defining desperate over such a long period. My take and that of quite a few Europeans is that their union has been well planned yet very complicated to establish. Indeed, most any political analysis would describe their drive as remarkable given the enormous roadblocks the US / IMF / dollar faction has
thrown at them. Truly, if "political hegemony of their elite" was all they were after, they would have scrapped all dollar support at the Jamaica Accords conference. They could have easily matched the economic deterioration that action would have caused, against the cost of no longer supporting
the dollar. These countries inflated their own internal currency systems in order to maintain a world dollar standard. This alone flies in the face of hegemony on their part, both then and now.

You write:

--------The purpose of the Euro is to trap capital and trade within a political block controlled by this elite ----------- It has only to do with political power attempting a last ditch effort of governments of Europe against the forces of globalization and economic and technological progress.--------It has nothing to do with any of the following: political subservience to the US, the
cost of using the dollar for international trade, the dollar's wobbly past or future, trade efficiencies, free trade or liberty of any sort.---------

That's a pretty broad statement. Sounds like the history of the world from beginning to end. (smile) Yet, I can find nothing in European culture, ideals, nationalism or society in general that I do not find here in the US. Usually the motivation is functioning under a different name, though the effect is the same. Americans have in the past thrust their protocols upon the Old World culture. In this light, some of us think this shouldn't effects a Euro policy response. Hello? Good perception comes with understanding and loose observations are useless when seen using tunnel vision.

Consider:

------We Americans trap world capital through dollar hegemony and call it "Americans for free trade" ------- We shutter at the thought of Euros in our pocket, as a second currency, and would impose any amount of foreign exchange controls to limit such. But we are very open to globalization at any time. ---- Trade efficiencies are great as long as they favor our lifestyle above other nations.
----- Further, our liberty is a good thing, but the liberty of others is unimportant if it interferes with our national interest. --------

Still, if the Europeans are trying to attain our same position in international affairs, it's seen as their elite power block holding on? No, that doesn't clean the laundry either.

Perhaps the difference of perception is seen on our last Trail Walk; --- As such the euro is important in that it challenges our (dollar) hegemony-----. This alone, ORO, is enough for us to structure for the outcome. Whether one can see the political motivations correctly or not, their Euro
will re-balance the world of currencies and have an outsized effect on the US.

You write,,,,,,,,,,

--------The legal provisions you talk of will not destroy or prevent a future gold banking system that might compete with the fiat insanity. It will destroy the countries that sign on to it, which are likely not to include the US and most of Asia unless taken over politically by EU influences (which
are not that strong there). -------------

Sir,
First of all, you should stay within the context of my discussion with Econoclast. We were presenting positions, not launching ICBMs. The position I presented is valid in limited circumstances that would include a fallen dollar. This has been discussed by others "overthere", among other criteria. You speak of fiat insanity? I point out to you and ET and Journeyman that hundreds of millions of us have been living with such a currency for some time. Insanity is a bit
cheap of a description when the world has endured wars and multitude human infliction for thousands of years. If this whole transition fails, we will still live out our lives with fiat, like it or not.

When you state the following:

-------The attachment of collateral to gold is innate in the action of trading gold. Without that, there is no trade in gold possible at all. All trade involves the creation of a debt, at least temporarily. The debt may be secured by the items traded, but transactions must involve a debt. Transactions also must involve a contract. Ownership of anything is title, either assumed through possession, or
documented. A system that does not allow collateral backing a contract denominated in gold is a system that does not allow gold to trade, and endangers title to gold not in possession. Doubtless, the purpose of such law would be to allow governments to confiscate gold held in custody (not in
possession) if the attempts to prevent monetary use of gold fail.-----------

You are right, it is innate to this current fraud of a dollar gold market. I know you are thinking in terms of the current dollar gold market function because the rest of this thrust sounds like it is right out of our current bullion bankers notes. Both past and present and is completely based upon a continuation of the same. We have no intention of traveling that road again.

Further you write:

------It is another attempt by EU governments to block the exits from a future Europe they imagine they can control. If implemented successfully, it will be Europe that will be destroyed by the absence of an efficient credit system keyed to effective gold denomination of debt. --------

The world has traveled this road before and failed to control it's controllers. Gold as official money is dead at the starting blocks, my friend. Send your best salesman around the world to sell that position for a living. Most certainally he will die of old age or lack of commissions before anyone will deal with him. If gold debt is what you strive for, then carry your torch and do your best. Just
don't ask the common man to suffer wealth loss again while we try to do it one more time.

Further by your hand:

---It would mean that the only interest rate available would be the innately incorrect one set by monetary authorities.------

Where is this at odds with a functioning fiat Euro that's controlled by the ECB? I will tell you, it is set with one/half an eye on the Euro price of FreeGold. Far different than the current world rate being played off a failing currencies economy and set by a paper gold market.

ORO,
All of the rest of your argument is an endorsement for gold debt in our constant fiat world. It has failed before and will fail again if allowed to be mingled into a political arena. The world's first gold coin was never money and yet was a perfect trade for another good. No debt was involved then at the time of trade and should not be now. The hard money school that has lead us down the gold / money path never stopped to consider that banking and gold do not and cannot coexist without corruption. We have learned from them. We know now what not to do!

Explain your position in point by point fashion and it will not amount to a "sellable conclusion". That's because the Old World culture chooses not to close a gold window again. We will, indeed, see how this all plays out as "time will prove all things". I will own physical gold and scoff at your bankers pleas for "one more try".

As always, thank you very much for your impute and opinion. (smile)

Of ORO's World

Hello again. I'll try to address several posters with this.
More comments on our current discussion, proceeding from my #53314.

ORO (5/9/01; 12:53:15MT - usagold.com msg#: 53296)
--------If Europe continues to expand and deepen regulation (as it has of late) while the US simplifies and thins regulation, the advantage would play in the favor of US industries despite higher dollar exchange rates.-------

Of ORO's world:
All of his conclusions above the closing (that statement is printed above) are based on the ongoing dollar reserve system as we have known it over several decades (even further back). Included during that time are all the excesses and faults dumped on the fiat money world by our nation making the best of it's dollar dominance. Also, included in that period were all the defensive plays
taken by other nation states. To be sure, those plays were also filled with excesses and faults, but what else do we expect from political societies.

The ongoing over taxation, deficit spending, fiat inflation, deficit trade balances and mismanagement of private economies has always been with us. Yes, under different names and different degrees, that's true, but no recent period in money history, gold or not, was without an ongoing effort to cheat the system. It was always in a process of decay, no matter what the books tell you. To think otherwise is to disclaim humans as they are.

How often have we heard that some special "hard school of thought" has all this terrible process documented and neatly explains where it all went wrong? Then, goes on to show us how to set it all up again so as to start over on the right foot.

So, trying to present the society as a whole, as "the awful, all controlling big government" on one side and the "good private economy on the other side" argues the lesser side of the larger issue;
-----hard money policy cannot work for long in a credit based system----!

It makes absolutely no difference if we are even on a 100% gold use money system, if we as a society engage in credit
commerce, we will break links with gold.

Consider:

I borrow 100oz of money gold from ten people so as to spend that gold doing commerce business. The hard money theory has us thinking that if I fail and cannot pay back the gold, this little portion of the money supply contracts. Thereby the gold system is perfect, as it slows the economic excess.
This is a minor example of gold banking. On a tiny scale. It works, as long as we don't act out our motions in a political way.

Conversely, if gold was not part of a banking,,,,, credit,,,,, lending system,,,, rather it is just a tradable, non-lendable non- official money asset,,,,, then those ten people would have given me their gold and became part owners in my (ours now) enterprise.
When it fails, our gold money is gone and no credit contract is lost in the process. Society at large will not come to our collective defense, no matter the scale of the loss. You see, we lost our assets, not society's official money!

The difference:

When gold is lent,,,,, when it's part of the banking system,,,,, when it becomes the object of a credit contract,,,,,, this whole hard money system falls into political RISK! No matter how perfect the "schools" have show this to work, in real life, political risk degrades our perfect credit money. This is the gray area that's not ironed out because we cannot iron out society's emotions. Let's see:

In the above, the ten people I borrowed gold from would be holding my IOUs for that 100 ounces. Be they private citizens, banks or corporations they have effectively lost their gold money. The very money of the nation state!

Rather than see their losses made final, and cause harm, they partition the government to intervene by recognizing those money (gold) loans as good on the books. Further, the government is asked to lend some of it's gold (collected through taxes) to me to extend my business life. I continue to function in a small way as I pay on those gold (money) loans. Further, those loans (held by ten lenders) become marketable as they become seasoned. Then, at a discount to their face value, they can be sold or kept as collateral assets. Over time, this is the political risk that seeps into any hard money system. Over time, even a gold credit system is expanded,,,,,, inflated,,,,,, until outright fiat
must come into play.

It never starts out as "big corrupt government and their awful bankers" controlling the "good honest people",,,,,, rather,,,,, it's when a large enough segment of the "good honest people" are threatened with losing enough (gold) money that it could take down the economy,,,,,, they demand (elect into office) that their government and therefore bankers, expand the (gold) credit enough so as to slow
the fall.

Further,

Now, if this remained on such a tiny scale as the above ten, nothing politically would change. But, modern economic structure is never on such a little scale. This is why I say "we are them"! Many are indignant that they be placed in such company and proclaim they would never be part of such
fraud. Well, that is the very nature that splits the society into the same half's ORO sees today.

His closing statement comes at the tail end of a drama that was played out over decades. His small slice of context completely excludes how the USA dollar,,,, gold,,,,, reserve system was parlayed into a cost advantage that will not exist once the dollar falls. We will be the ones,,,,,,, much more so than Europe,,,,,, who ""expand and deepen regulation"" as our "advantage falls away"!

FOA - NO OFFICIAL MONEY NEED BE DEFINED
FOA, you are missing the point of my disaffection entirely.

I'll get back to ORO's, but first PH.

--------

Hello PH, long time no discussion (smile).

In your recent: ------ PH in LA (5/10/01; 10:49:57MT - usagold.com msg#: 53345) Just a mere interjection into the tirade.----

You write:
-------------Rather, he is trying to prove the viability of his thesis, much as we all love him (smile, smile). You put your finger right on his weakest link when you say, "Gold as official money is dead at the starting blocks." Unfortunately, this is ORO's one agenda. So, of course, he is perfectly willing to loosen his ICBMs to defend it. ----------

PH,
I kind of agree with you, but I don't think this is his singular objective. He has a wonderful presence here as his commentary is coterie with the objectives of the forum. Still, I feel this is his most passionate objective and that's why I always hesitated to oppose it. Not that we would be the object of a tirade, rather that our thoughts would be rejected without "in context of the times"
consideration.

-------------For my part, your proposed solution just resonates right. In the present fiat system, there is really no refuge. The lords and masters have every tool at the ready to debase the product of my labors (ie savings) and the only defense against them is risk. --------------

Oh boy! Don't you know it, PH! This is where I say that all of this is an evolution. Not so much in the changing aspect, but in the slowness of the process. Over years we (most especially Western minded savers) have come to accept the necessity of the "fiat settlement" function as it is needed in our modern economy. Ok, well enough, we can all buy that.

As such, we even understood the inflation price such a system's use places on us. People rebelled against it at first, as it started as an evil throw-back into the past experiences of fiat gold systems; where price inflation meant that the money was about to be destroyed and redenominated. Then, over time, as the dynamics of our world trade became better understood, this price inflation was
seen by most users as more of a tax that the system required to function. As long as it was low enough that we could out-gain it thru other investments, the benefits that our fiat trading economy provided was accepted.

We at first feared it, but in the longness of time we have grown numb to the slow hidden increases of this fiat inflation tax. In the US, especially, the full price of the tax is way, way above anything we imagine. Most of it hidden over many years in our "Dollar Reserve" function so as we do not conceive it's full impact upon our net worth.

Again, this world "fiat settlement tax,,,, this price inflation tax, would have been somewhat acceptable in an immoral sort of way, as society stole the productivity and efficiency gains (from those that could provide such) to pay for it. But, hidden theft is just too good of a process for our political system not to expand on. Just as I said in # 53425:

"""" It never starts out as "big corrupt government and their awful bankers" controlling the "good honest people",,,,,, rather,,,,, it's when a large enough segment of the "good honest people" are threatened with losing enough (gold) money that it could take down the economy,,,,,, they demand (elect into office) that their government and therefore bankers, expand the (gold) credit enough so as to slow the fall."""

PH,
When "We",,,, "this Us the political system is",,,, need someone else to cover our economic failings, the government does just what the "MAJORITY" demands and expands the inflation tax just a little more to cover it. Over the recent US dollar experiment, from 1971, "us Westerners" have built up an enormous inflation tax debit upon our dollar based assets. The full debit is unknown because the
dollar's reserve function has masked it's exchange rate value, there by covering up the real value of our dollar denominated assets. So,,,,,,,,,,,, to expand on your next:

-----"Invest in ________s!" they say. Fill in the blank with stocks, bonds, real estate, IRAs, (whatever) for all of which they have their fingers on the controlling strings. This is patently unfair. Once earned, the individual needs somewhere to put his savings where he can have control over
them... somewhere beyond the managers' inflationary reach. In our system of voluntary slavery, they hold our noses to the grindstone and make us all work out our lifetimes. ----------

PH, you are so right in this perception. As per my above, we invest in these assets, thinking that our out-sized gains are keeping well ahead of the inflation tax. Basically, people don't want or look for that special "somewhere to put his savings where he can have control ", because they don't think there is a problem. Can we blame them? Some of us even acknowledge that the CPI being so low is a fraud, but our other gains were so large we are still ahead! Still, just look at the lifestyle we all have because of our continued use of the Dollar Reserve Fiat.

Well, that's fair enough. We Westerners play at this game of currency cheating, but don't want others to think of it the that context. Further, if something is wrong, it was the fault of that big government and banking cabal that I never had anything to do with??? (smile)

I know that far too many think the system is healthy enough to go on forever maintaining their lifestyle. It won't. Currency systems come and go with time and our dollar is being phased out. Eventually, as the next reserve system unfolds, our US inflation rate will spike into hyper status. Not because the dollar or our economy is suddenly nonfunctional, but because all the past "inflation tax
deficits" that we built up over decades will come due. Then, not only the price of using our fiat system will be exposed,,,,, the price of all the political bailouts and American lifestyle enhancements will come due also. It will require a hugh devaluation of the dollar to cover this debt. It will appear to us as a sudden, hyperinflation, imposed on us by an unfair, European government,,,, out to get us. This is the perception ORO is, in a very small way, already bringing to surface.

Many hard money investors have evolved into "morphed goldbugs", no longer the real K-Rand carrying physical gold advocates they started out as. Now, they are wanting the dollar reserve to remain so that their dollar based gold industry investments can survive. Even wanting their leveraged paper gold to make it through the game intact. It won't.

Some of these "morphed goldbugs" want the paper gold
system fixed so it's fictional gold price can rise just enough to make their gold business investments pay off. It won't.

Not only will their "fighting the last war" strategy fail, they rile against any Thought that the Euro may cause all this convulsion to come about. So, they hurl everything they have at it as events play this drama into reality. In the process, our modern goldbugs sound more and more like
dollar advocates,,,,, and in effect their investments say they are.

The system will, in the end, completely fail to function in a way that reflects the physical price of gold bullion. Most of these goldbugs will eventually get some price gain as it all unwinds, but they will be standing at the fence looking in at real gold far out pacing everything in sight. Wondering why they even played such a game anyway. You see, our Western gold bugs are doing nothing more than your other investors, just trying to make some more dollar currency to beat the fiat tax of price inflation. They should be considering owning some of that "currency without a country" we recently heard USAGOLD talk about.

They, like most all the other dollar users will be in the same boat as our dollar's reserve function fails in a "game change" no one understands. The dynamics will rewrite our history books in:

""""what to do when the worlds one and only fiat currency is replaced by another fiat currency based on a gold wealth reserve instead of a gold is money reserve""".

Again, as MK pointed out, this new concept will create a "gold wealth without a country". Only most will perceive it as a new gold money without a country. That's ok, too.

You write:

-----Your proposed system at least holds out the possibility of an asset designed to hold its value in the face of their inflation. Seems logical to me. Seems like a system we could live with. The only system that we'll ever get, will be one that we can all live with. Maybe not anyone's perfect system. Not ORO's utopian gold standard. But at least one that most can tolerate. Who among us can really tolerate a system that sucks the value out of our savings through their insidious inflation if their is no refuge? No defense? -----------

You have a good political brain, my friend (smile).

-------why not declare your advocacy------

In the singular context that your question was asked,,,,,, I ask you, why should we? What would be added to our effort, what would be gained? More gold or fame? At this stage of life have enough of both. No, the basic value of the message would be diluted. Truly, I add that in this world the gift of understanding is expensive to package and the art of producing it is has no measurement of pay. For myself, it's priceless.

Thanks, PH

Cavan Man,
Thank you so much for your kind words and respected interest. Onward, my friend! (smile)

Journeyman,
--- Apparently I've been left out of this discussion as far as the-----

If you will just check your back to see that it is all wet. (smile) Not dry yet because of that water balloon I tossed at you in a recent post. No sir, if you write here, you are not out of it(grin).
Thanks for writing, I'll (and others) will be replying !

Black Blade,
Are you, by chance one of those people in the TV show "West Wing"? I'm always amassed at your ability to gather and organize so much material. Thought you were one of the upper level fellas?
Thanks for sharing.

Now, once again, back to PH:

Fiat legal tender vs abolishment of futures markets by fiat

------"This note is legal tender for all debts public and private"------So sayeth every FRN used in commerce. This is a topic that has been elucidated here at great length... even and especially by ORO himself. ----------Now, one supposes that any legal system that specifies that gold interest can be settled with any "note (which) is legal tender for all debts public and private" that no contract
could be enforced in gold. -------Does this mean the abolishment of gold as a monetary instrument? ------Are all gold transactions thereby abolished?-----

PH, you sure don't need any Gingko - Biloba to clear your thoughts. This post of yours hit the logic I was straining for,,,,, right on the head! I edited it to do like Randy (thanks Randy) sometimes does to mine. To allow for an expanded point.

Pulling from the thrust of my last comment to you; we all accept, use and somewhat prosper by using this fiat money called legal tender dollars. Further, we all pay our price inflation tax as a cost of doing business,,,,,,, as long as it doesn't get out of hand or we can cover it with other
investments. Or, at least, as long as we aren't able to see the real value destruction this tax is building up under cover of it's "currency reserve" power. However, for the purpose of grasping our reasoning here,,,,, concerning my recent trail walk talk about changing the collateral rules of gold,,,,,,,,,,,, lets look at your counter point to ORO.

He made a long reasoned post, expanding his thoughts on why no authority could enforce such a law. Yet, your point above presents the essence of this concept, in real life as we have lived with it for decades. Fiat dollars, as legal tender, are our money because court after court has upheld that our laws declare them so.

Some say that international law and protocols cannot have an impact? Well, they do when it's in the reining powers best interest. The US now and the EuroZone later. In present context; here we have 200+ million westerners and countless other world citizens,,,, all having lived a good portion of our lives using this very system,,, working under legal tender status,,,, and all doing so under our American law.

Yes, this legal tender fiat money,,,,, this concept of digital trading wealth,,,, is used by most as an "International Protocol" contract,,,,, made common through the IMF and the Jamaica Accords! It's the same US dollar system that made the settlement of debt in gold almost illegal and the common use of of our money a world wide obsession! How about that for not being able to make something stick?

Now; when I proposed to Econoclast (on the GoldTrail); that an understanding could be projected that gold could not be seen in a court of law as attachable collateral in any contract form,,,,,,,, some pointed out that this couldn't be done. Yet, in opposite reflection, it almost already has (smile)!

Our thrust is that; by taking physical gold out of any and all performing credit structures, one enhances the fiat credit process,,,,,,, but more importantly,,,,,, frees the ability of gold to value any and all currencies ---- against each other----- not against gold. Once in place, physical gold value would soar, but not do it as money,,,,, rather as an asset. In this fashion, raw gold value could not be inflated or deflated and in doing such would reflect it's possession value as wealth. Tradable wealth that you or any government could use to buy anything,,,,,,, as long as it was a payment in full without credit.

Some fear that a congress of laws would be required to control such a position? No, just one,,,, kind of like our legal tender law. How about "gold is not subject to collateral attachment of any debts public and private". Of course, gold loans could be written and entered into,,,,,,,, gold options could be created,,,,,, Bullion banks could do a huge business in lending gold and governments could lend it all! But, if any of these contracts defaults and ends up in a court of law,,,,, it dead at the door! I'll leave it to you to figure out how long this business would continue.

PH, we are staring at one of the biggest paper gold lending games ever created on the face of the earth. Further, it's about to completely fail as the main currency it's all written in "craps out" (had to throw in some of my gutter talk (smile)). When all of this washes out, how do you think the next reserve currency owners are going to preserve their hegemony? That's right, I knew you already understood all this.

Thanks

Hello ORO,
I know I keep talking about your presentations, but as they say in hollywood; "that's the price of fame"!

ORO (05/12/01; 00:19:12MT - usagold.com msg#: 53458)
FOA - NO OFFICIAL MONEY NEED BE DEFINED

You write:

------FOA, you are missing the point of my disaffection entirely. In my preferred rendition of a monetary system, there is no particular official money, just a legal recognition of a commonly accepted money (and no limitation on it being only one or many, if the markets leave one surviving money – probably gold – fine, if not then two or more are fine). Bankers have no charters, and their liabilities stand on their own. This is not a gold standard unless it turns into one.---------

ORO,
Your heart is in the right place and you have a brilliant mind to keep it pumping. (smile) But, what this entails is us starting creation all over again. My friend, I have studied a little bit about old gold, it's progression throughout civilization's timeline and how we got to this point today. Yes, we may and most likely will return to a period that recreates what you say above. But, that will happen after this bunch of humanity gets through experimenting with it's fiat creations. ORO, the world is just not ready to go again where you are pointing right now.

You write:
-------Lenders and equity investors do not have the expectations you presented. Only bank depositors do, even then only those who think of a bank as a depository and clearing house rather than an investment fund like a money market. For savers interested in a gold vault and clearing
service the markets have long known to provide a service with minimal or nearly no risk. For everyone else, who is investor and saver, it is a traditional bank he seeks. No bond holder would ever imagine the promises in hand to be money or a good substitute for it. They are investments,
NOT savings. They are a fruit tree owned for the future fruit it is to bear, not dried fruit that will last
generations.-------------

I agree. However, we are living at the very tail end of what we have called "this currencies timeline". True you are,,,,,, our current world of lenders and investors don't seek a separate wealth form in singular gold. They presently need only the one dollar currency to play with. This view is
indeed the extrapolation of their life's money experience, as they have know no other. I don't blame them and group their perspectives into one, calling it the "Western Thought".

To them, our present currency system will not fail to deliver their wealth, intact, against all odds. In this they save their assets in the position that the dollar's contract will stand. ORO, our society does not grasp the gut feeling that comes with currency default. When an icy stare of a contract specialist leans across the negotiating table and says "what if we walk"?

They walked in 1971 because of political circumstances (oil figured largely in this), they did it then because they wanted to. This time, the US will walk because it has to! Run the printing press, full out, and retain a super inflating currency system,,,,,, or drop the ball and be subjugated to entirely using the money of another nation block. This is the eventual checkmate.

In this, your investors and lenders will understand the need for Another asset beside their fiat. Another fruit that "will" last generations.

You say:
--------- You may have come across a Barron's article-------------It is not that people first had banking and then government came in to bail out the depositors by forcing everyone to accept bank paper instead of gold. It is the other way round, bankers were incredibly cautious when they were not granted any privilege, the few happy go lucky Wild West banks were not at all characteristic of the situation when the central bank was closed down (both the first and second banks of the US did not have their charters renewed).------------Your view is of a world in which people start out with groundless expectations to make foolish decisions after which they cry to government to bail them out. That has never been the case. It has always been government that made promises that it could not keep knowing that the people have no alternate government to turn to if the promises are not kept, and it is this same government that gave privileges and subsidy to banks so that they could
make promises they could not keep with impunity because all banks were governed by the same rules, leaving customers no choices and little opportunity (and therefore incentive) to practice judgment. The rules were not made to fit the customers preferences within the confines of the reality, they were set into law in order to frustrate him.----------------

But ORO, lets reason a moment? You are absolutely correct in the above and more! Yet, that portion of the story has made the case of every hard money author and it's still only part of the human play. Better said, it's only part of the perception.

Why do you think there were banks at all, back then? They existed to provide a service private people would not perform very much of,,,,,,, lend gold. Back then, nobody wanted to lend their money. Not to strangers, not to schisters,,,, and certainly not to family members (smile). Gold money was cash money and credit wasn't offered in mass. People were suspicious of each other and rightly so. We are all a bunch of crooks! Ha! Ha!

Now banks were, as they are today, just middle men taking your money, lending it to others and trying to profit from it. Back then, there was certainly a growing demand for credit, it's just that no one wanted to take the risk to lend. The same as today, there is (was) a dynamic growing demand for credit that is over and above the function of cash trading. (that is wealth for wealth or gold for
goods commerce) Banks were seen as filling this gap and taking the risk the private sector would not provide.

In this context one can understand that society created the demand for banks by wanting credit. By extension, our nation demanded banks and the service they provided. The very nature of society was to want to borrow and accept the risk of that credit, but not to lend with the the risk of losing
their own money. Both then and now this is a basic human trait. One of the reasons most would not keep their money in a bank without FDIC insurance. Don't mind borrowing it, but damn if I'm gona lose it???

So,,,,, this creature that was forced upon us was really something we demanded. You said above that:

-----this same government that gave privileges and subsidy to banks so that they could make promises they could not keep with impunity because all banks were governed by the same rules, leaving customers no choices and little opportunity (and therefore incentive) to practice
judgment.-----

Oh boy, that paints them poor customers as little "darlings",,,,,, Cowboys, New Yorkers and Denver society that just lost their way? (smile) My friend, gold coin was money back then, you didn't have to use the banks for transactions and you didn't have to borrow it's money! We created the demand for their service then, because no one else would lend to us, period! There was choice,,,, there was opportunity to practice judgment,,,,,, you didn't have to borrow! However,,,,, when those little "darlings" lost all their money in railroads, cattle and silver mines (grin), they screamed to high heaven for more credit and damn the gold supply. Had they done their credit business with the wife's father-in-law, they would have been hanging from the nearest tree. Instead, they asked the government to "make them bad banks" lend more, no matter if they had it or no.

You state several questions:

------ Is it structured into human society that political representatives be crooks? ----
Almost as large a percentage as the electorate that chooses them.

----Is the balance of power between the people and their government fixed in nature so that government can always pull the wool over their people's eyes? ------
No, nature gives equal wool to everyone, both public and private.

----Are the people always going to be overwhelmed by government? ------
Only the ones that cannot out think government.

----Will people not learn from their own experience and from history? ------
Most never have and never will.

------Has the availability of instantaneous information and thoughts not changed anything?-------
The answer is no.

ORO, my trite answers are unfortunately true to reality. Ever more so today, we must deal with what can be done, not what should be done.

Next:

Further you went on to use my two examples, one of a gold loan and the other of paying for an asset. However this went out of context in the second as I was establishing an example of paying cash for an asset,,,,,, for a business,,,,,, for anything. The contrast was in not taking on credit to conduct commerce.

You say:

-----In the 100 oz loan,-------
-----In joining a partnership-------

---------I am sure you are aware of the difference between a loan and equity ------

Well, yes I am. In a further extension and clarification of my point; in paying cash for anything we are establishing equity in what we buy. Most financial thinkers try to limit the equity expression to mostly business or financial asset ownership. However, there is equity in any cash purchase. From shoes and cars,,,,, coats and houses,,,,,,,,, electricity (Black Blade) and natural gas,,,,,,, even
enjoyment equity in the theater ticket because of the great play one gets to experience.

The problem today is that few of us have established in our minds the dual nature of using our tradable wealth. Credit, we are all aware of as credit cards,,,,, debit cards and bank loans,,,, can and does buy our way. But the closest comparison to using gold in a final, non credit trade is seen in paying cash for everything. In this context, most people could relate to using gold as a trading asset where credit is not wanted.

However, in the gold not as collateral position; Greshams Law would do the work that our ancient gold owners understood. Gold would travel and trade on the road,,,,,, in our day that would mean buying what was dear and most wanted. Gold would be dear, super valuable and saved, in
possession as a wealth of ages. Giving legs to whatever fiat the world needs credit in. Fiat would be spent and valued for the credit qualities a digital currency could provide, right beside gold.

In closing I say,

Gold, the money it never was and the wealth it never forgot to be.

Thanks for your great mind, sir. Your comments are always welcome on this trail we walk.

"We watch this new gold market together, yes?"

Fed - BIS - ECB - China

Hello all!

Boy, things are shaping up for a real good Trail hike in a week or so! Let's look at some recent items and try to come up with a plan for our walk. Consider:

There was a little mention in some circles about China buying gold recently. I think Gata got wind of it, too. Here is an old post I made at the main forum:

---------------
Trail Guide (04/25/01; 15:04:48MT - usagold.com msg#: 52536)
Comment to Randy's post of:
Randy (@ The Tower) (04/24/01; 10:38:48MT - usagold.com msg#: 52458)
Follow-up on my comment last week that China has lately been a net been seller of silver
------Philip Klapwijk, managing director of GFMS, explained at Monday's conference of the Gold and Silver Institute that China sold near 60 million ounces of silver in 1999, with additional sales of 40 million ounces per year likely over the next couple years. Continuing...----------------
Your (Randy's) words:
--------China is simply lagging by one Century in performing this act. Many of the other nations of the world unleashed their silver reserves near the arrival of the 1900's when the usage of silver was abandoned as redundant within the banking sector. And in contrast, not surprisingly, global gold reserves have GROWN since those days. Further, the dollar can be expected to suffer a worse fate than silver when it, too, loses its particular reserve and settlement role within the international banking system. And gold? All reasonable signs show that it shall maintain the king position as THE reserve asset par excellence for a long time to come. Get you some. ------------------
(TrailGuide responds)

Hello Randy,
You know, your thoughts got me thinking (grin). I have time to do that right now as my files are restored.

Following your chain of thought about China silver,,,, I noticed a comment from Bush that we would fight them over Taiwan. Then silver gets hit real good (the day the comment was made). Could it be they are unloading silver so as to buy Euros and gold prior to calling it splits with us?
They do have more silver than their needs require (possibly more than all of us require).

If they are, indeed, going to run with the Euro later and the ECB is marking gold (not silver) as their main "wealth reserve", then it makes sense for China to position themselves this way. It also makes sense because as an addition, Hong Kong has so many dollar reserves they, too, could never unload them. Following the Euro system lead, they could afford to let their dollar reserves burn as long as they had even 15% of that value in gold prior to full "Euro roll-in".

Further,
If any EuroZone based gold paper they (China) own that had a US originator (US financial institution) and that defaults; with China's approval, that paper could be restructured to pay back in Euro currency assets. Courtesy of the ECB /BIS. Forcing the US originator to dump dollar based gold hedges (that's a lot of paper gold) as they buy Euro coverage to ensure exchange matching. Of course, extrapolating this system wide, we would see paper gold credibility plunge (therefore it's bid price also) aside from the Euro exchange rates spiking on the dollar. All the while out right trade in physical gold or "five day" (super spot delivery) would spike to the heavens. I do wonder if we are, as I said a number of days ago, seeing history in the making with lease rates doing strange things now? (smile)

end
------------------------------------------------------------

OK everyone, could it be that Europe and China are linking more closely? With China not only playing the Euro card, but also seeing this future economic powerhouse (EuroLand) as a two way market for their goods? Lets look at a more recent item out of the IHT:

China Has a Change of Heart on Bond Sale

HONG KONG For American investment banks in China, politics has often been a handmaiden to business, enabling the more savvy firms to elbow aside their rivals with comparable credentials for deals.

Now, with the debut of a potential $1.5 billion bond offering by China, the Americans have gotten a taste of their own tactics. And politics, far from being subordinate, may have played a decisive role.

On Thursday, the Chinese government announced that three top U.S. investment banking firms - Goldman, Sachs Co., J.P. Morgan Chase Co., and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co. - would handle its first overseas bond deal since late-1998.

The next day, three European banks - Barclays Capital Group, BNP Paribas SA, and Deutsche Bank AG - issued a statement saying that they had been awarded the portion of the offering that would be denominated in euros.

end
------------------------------

OK. Next, we move to an excelent commentary in the COMMENTARY & REVIEW portion of USAGOLD (get your password if you want to read all of it). In this, Michael Kosares notes how the latest LBMA volume seems to show that the gold lending business is unwinding. He writes:
--- """LBMA April gold turnover was down a steep 12.5%. That could very well be the largest drop since the LBMA started publishing its daily volume figures. If nothing else it clearly signals that something is changing, and perhaps changing abruptly, in the gold lending business.""" end ----------
Combine this with a recent,,,,,, almost permanent overall rise in gold leasing rates,,,,,,,, the start of which began with a rate spike that was only lowered when England was forced to reduce it's London gold sales to 20 ton from 25 ton,,,,,,,,,,,,, then, the ECB no longer following the FED and continuing it's responsible management of it's money rates,,,,,,,,, our Euro creation spawned this new high world oil price from currency competition and that's beginning to bite the weekest financial structure (USA),,,,,,,,, and some thing is indeed changing!

We have completely agreed with the ECB policy, in that they see the EuroZone as the stronger (in overall economic function) between them and the USA. Stronger, in that they could handle a short term dollar oil rise if it lead to Euro settlement. In fact, the recent 1/4 point cut by the ECB, as opposed to the several cuts by the FED, is enforcing that note of distinction upon producers as the FED will and must cut much further. They (the FED) now risks exposing that their purpose of lowering rates is a effort to save the bookkeeping side of it's derivative bloated financial structure, not rebuilding of the US economy at all.

All this, in an effort to slow the dollar killing effects of sharing the currency reserve function with the EuroZone. Only one step in the complete loss of reserve currency altogether. We will see this spelled out as they pump dollar reserves from now on,,,, over and above any possible economic need. The result will be a slow and steady slide into higher and higher price inflation inside the US.
(Look to Randy at USAGOLD to repost this progress)

Further,

The pressure may be pushing toward a colossal "transition" of financial power later this year as the Euro begins it's final stage of EMU; the distribution of circulating Euros. Once complete, EuroZone economic dynamics will lead them to no longer need Dollar reserves for international use or the backing for their currency. A fact not lost on China and other major dollar holders. If events proceed as expected, they (EuroZone and or China) may just discard these assets as worthless. Especially given that with the US running a tremendous trade deficit, dollars cannot return on a "net / net" basis without plunging it's exchange rate to nothing! Perhaps it's worth further watching how our long bond treasury paper is sold ahead of the fact!

With all this in the background, we now feel a disruption in the force (old line from star Wars movie). The recent BIS meeting may have set the stage for an eventual monumental change in the way gold is traded, owned and valued. The very fact that a major portion of the US gold stock has been changed in status in a way that would allow it's movement (ownership); means that the US has now entertained the same position as England is doing regarding gold and the EMU with Europe. We (the US) are preparing for the destruction of the dollar's gold world. In this, some players will have to be saved (with real gold) if the dollar is to have any existence at all in the new Euro reserve function.

At some point, our dollar denominated paper gold system will crack and plunge in value as it's credibility to be converted into real gold is destroyed. In the process taking down most of the gold industry. An industry who's stock equity value is daily market to and closely follows said dollar gold system. In time, we will all understand the currency supporting function and the industry killing nature of a Free Gold price. As it's surging value more than compensates the dollar's lost value in the hands of foreign CBs.

This particular line of perception is being driven home in recent ECB commentary as their President, Mr. D., has discussed the very mechanism to delineate foreign held Euro money assets. (see Randy's recent ECB news) Assets that, per my above to Randy, will explode in numbers as our busted paper dollar gold market drives these institutions into Euro financing arrangements. These new, increasing, non expansive assets will be balanced by their system's surging gold price and exported bullion from other nations. A process that in part allows the US to adjust it's gold ownership just to stay in the game.

The world is changing and the Physical Gold Advocate will be the ones keeping score!

I'm going fishing now. Both, for the real item and with one that knows the name of our recently caught prize fish. I'll make a few more comments on Centennial's forum before going. Rest up, the big walk is coming!

Last Comment for a while

Hello all, I have a few replies and comments to make (smile).

Journeyman (05/13/01; 08:26:15MT - usagold.com msg#: 53512)
Human nature and the gold standard @Trail Guide, ORO, beesting, Turnaround, ALL

You write:
----1. According to Trail Guide, "Gold money was cash money and credit wasn't offered in mass."

So, you didn't borrow against future hours of your life to go to a fancy resaurant (and give more of your future hours to banksters in the form of interest). Instead you saved-up from the past hours of your production, had the same meal in that fancy restaurant - - - and _didn't_ pay interest to the
banking establishment. You kept the amount you would have paid in interest - - - which gave you the appetizer in next month's fancy dinner. What's wrong with that? (Of course! - - - The bankers don't like it!)
end
---------

Well, my self evident point was that without banks (back then), people didn't want to loan their money. This is and was a fact. As our world society has matured over centuries, one item has stood out; people want to borrow and borrow a lot. In some ways this is good, in most ways this is
awful. It's our nature to make a mess of our financial lives with borrowed money. Still, this does not negate the reality that credit demand is a somewhat driving force in us. We are willing to pay the relative cheap returns (interest) in order to borrow fiat, but always rebel at the high real returns required to borrow gold. It's been that simple.

No, there isn't anything wrong with paying as we go, and that item was not the thrust of my point. The direction taken was to note the reality we as an economic body have evolved into. That reality requires that we be provided with a fiat currency to borrow, even if it's cheap interest (relative to gold) is adjunct through eventual price inflation. And the tax on our wealth such represents.

You write:

-----Perhaps, you're thinking, "But there would be no money available for capital equipment and development. How then do you explain that the period up thru 1913 (the year we clandestinely went off the gold standard because of the passage of the Federal Reserve Act) was perhaps the
most prosperous in American history with a growth rate well above 4% per year? Without modern credit, people would indeed be more careful what they gambled on, ah, invested in, but history strongly suggests that didn't mean they didn't gamble, ah, invest. There probably would not have
been a .com mania, etc., if we were still on the gold standard. What's wrong with that?
end
---------

Well, you have absolutely made my point (smile). Our economic function, prior to 1913, was constrained by the fact that no one would pay the high rates said gold system demanded. Any type of gold discipline drives down credit expansions once they hit the credit limits that limited gold
demands. This is, as I stated before, perfect in the eyes of our hard money masters and I agree completely.

However, I and we hard money people does not a total society make. The very reason hard money systems fail is because they all engage credit lending. Hard money and credit do not and will not mix because:

!! the economy "us people" built on "this credit" will fail and destroy "our assets" if said credit extension is stopped by a gold standard. That is the exact reason the fed left gold in 1913!!

Once again, every thing yourself and ORO state only builds my case. That is because all of your examples and demonstrated positions are built upon a singular gold money system that must include credit.

You write:

------2. I don't know who Trail Guide has been hanging-out with these days, but I do know that while I've run across crooks in my day, there are nowhere near the percentage of crooks among my friends and family - - or even among my acquaintences - - as there are in Washington D.C.
end
------

Well, I have none in my family (that I know of smile). But I have to ask, where have you been while gaining your fundamental economic perspective? I know that in my earth, crooks are everywhere.

As an adjunct, let me repost an earlier relevant post I made to you:

Trail Guide (04/25/01; 18:00:42MT - usagold.com msg#: 52549)
Journeyman (04/24/01; 13:39:01MT - usagold.com msg#: 52464)

Mr. Journeyman,
Excellent presentation of your position! Thank you.

The main point I am making about gold and money is directly related to your first statement.

You write:

-------we DON'T need fiat, and neither "the people" nor "society" decided to go from the classical gold standard to FED fiat. That change was foisted on "the people" AND "society" by the banking-government cliques, with the express purpose of profiting these two groups at the expense
of the rest of the population.
end
--------

Absolutely Journeyman. Your articulated account is regarded as an unshakable law amongst our Western hard money crowd. Indeed, it is this very perception that drives the rethinking today about fiat's relationship with gold. That thinking is spelled out in self evident form in this passage from the trail:

"" It's not the management of money that was the problem, it was the management of man's authority to maintain gold and it's discipline. Over and over, we watch good monetary theory fail as society fails to control their controllers.""

This is the root problem we face in advancing another of your classical gold standards. The people could not rebuff the forces that "foisted" the evil upon them. The problem is not deciphering whether someone else did the deed, it is in the understanding that it can and will happen again.
Society nor mankind itself can manage those that can and do these changes for their own gain. This is what we face, this is what we address.

As a further measure of defining and rebuffing this dilemma, I went on to say:

"" The road before us is to not manage gold. Rather, stop (to stop managing) it entirely. Forget about calling it official money and let it seek it's own level against every fiat as a worldly wealth.""

Even if the charge of returning us to a "classical gold standard" was given unconditionally to Sir Journeyman, this person would face all the exact same pressured his predecessors faced. The account of history and our experience with human nature all say he would do no better.

Further, to mitigate the loss all of us experience as this repeats, I made this point:

"" Indeed, while we may never overcome the human failures of war and fiat inflation, the wealth of common man does not have to be expended while society tries yet another time.""

That simple reply, my friend addresses all our experience with moneys.

end
----------------

This is our direction and thrust. Society would, as ORO makes the point, always pick gold as their tradable wealth. However, it is society's "lot in life" to always want credit,,,,,, then rebel in paying back said credit by diluting the payment terms. Usually by changing the rules so fiat replaces the very gold they borrowed. Hard money thought has always tried to paint the government and
bankers as the villain in this and tried to structure rules and laws so as to control them. Then it all happens again. After all these years of attempting to manage gold as a medium of exchange, we define gold simply be a tradable wealth without credit availability. This lone action would replace thousands of laws and rules our past experiments required. Yet, they failed anyway.

Even ET lays out that such a proposition is in his eyes is "" socialism"" ET (05/12/01#: 53493).

---------I prefer free markets over your socialism------- Seems to fly in the face of any kind of gold advocacy.
end
------------

I say that the only socialist mind is the hard money one that must dilute gold's value through credit. All done for the purpose of extending their Western power structures. Structures that could not achieve the dominance in currency they did without defrauding gold by combining it with credit. Truly, the wise gold advocate can see the socialist slant that motivates a hard money advocate's need for credit. Like tomatos, they start out green and eventually turn red! The same for Egold, sold as pure gold untill credit demands ripen it's creators appetite.

---------"Yes, this legal tender fiat money,,,,, this concept of digital trading wealth,,,, is used by
most as an "International Protocol" contract,,,,, made common through the IMF and the Jamaica Accords! It's

That's the type of thing people always think (or at least say) when they institute their fiats. And especially reiterate strongly when their fiats are reaching the end of their time lines. And some are duped and many opportunists go along for the ride.

They said it of French assignats - - - up through their first nine-and-a-half years. They said it of German marks - - - until after WWI. They said it of the Brazillian currency just before the "real" and of the Ecuadorian sucre - - - until last year. They said it of the Turkish lira. Etc. They're saying it of the dollar. But if Trail Guide is correct, a similar fate awaits the dollar as well. And it's just around the corner.

end
------------------

Well, my point was that if society can institute the dollar as our trading fiat,,,, and do it for as long as they have,,,,,,,, it would be a far simpler proposition to exclude gold as collateral for credit. Did you somehow think I was promoting the above items as proof for the Euro (or dollar?)? I doubt anyone was duped by my statement, especially when read in full context as given.

you write:

--------So what's different today than ever before in history that makes some folks here so optimistic about modern fiats??? In the above contexts, why is it so hard to imagine transactional gold?
end
------------

Everything we have given demonstrated that the Euro will inflate. Only inflate less than our dollar will or has in the past. In this light we are not optimistic, rather realistic. We encourage a floating fiat, full ensconced in all it's government's credit glory. Failing as it will against itself and every other currency.

Further, we do not imagine Free Gold,,,, we embrace it now along with it's creation,,,,and the correct value this system will display for our future generations. Gold held and traded as wealth, not mired in your past credit world Western minds seek to instill.

In closing, I repost my note to Econoclast:

-----I feel discouraged right now. Not because the gold price is low, not because of what is happenning in the gold market, and by extension the financial world, but because of the fact that what I see for the future is more of the same.--------

My friend, our message and our position is that we are in one of the most exciting times of all the history of gold! We have seen that during times with the most radical transitions, the majority are usually defending the wrong asset. This unfortunate situation need not impact everyone today. If better judgment is the result of a full understanding, then some who read here will be exposed to
tools that could help them avoid the mistakes of our Western hard money majority.

For Western Gold Bugs today, their culture, their system and their recent knowledge is all ensconced within the last 30 years of paper wealth. Yet they are using a hard money defense, written by masters preceding our modern era. They struggle to use that logic out of context, as it is
thought to apply to this gold market today. These two precedents are leading them to reflect their gold values in some form other than physical ownership in possession. This mistaken detour from gold's true purpose will once again prove, by reality, the value of owning real gold.

Standing aside this group is the Physical Gold Advocate. For them, for us, these times will contain the greatest gain in real wealth ever seen. For those who are falling behind, gold is still within your grasp.

Just a note and quick comments. Last post, packing to go,,,,,,, will send in Another's (plus updates) when I return.

Beesting, your note about electronic gold is interesting. Ha! Ha!,,, It seems Americans (and most Westerners) never can quite keep their hands on physical gold. Even in the past when minted by their governments. They are always setting themselves up for some paper fraud or eventual credit saving transition that grabs their wealth with a rules change. Could be your lot in life??? With gold ownership reasoning following your paper gold route, is it no wonder the Governments and Banks, that hard money
people always blame, find it so easy to eventually "fiat" the citizens. We ask for it in our rationalizing of physical money / wealth concepts. Demanding a convienense we don't need?? Truly, in the future, why own paper gold when the real thing will do,,,, especially when a paper Euro fiat will fill most (if not all) of our daily buying,,, on credit or no???? Besides, even though we agree that official gold will never again be part of our money system, these same EuroZone officials will promote and endorse ownership of Free Gold for all. On second thought, perhaps it is only in the West that paper gold is always at risk,,,,, who knows???

Things are heating up! Expect this lease rate rise to run for a while,,,, trending higher. With the ECB rates now 1/2% above Fed rates,,,,,, the dollar transition will explode into full bloom. A few news points:

----Traders said talk the Taiwan central bank had been buying euros started the rally-------

------The well-flagged U.S. rate cut had seen the dollar notch up modest gains against the euro in Asia. But it failed to hold its advantage as talk of central bank commercial orders to buy euros --

------"The bigger issue is, we're four-and-a-half months into interest rate cuts in the States and we're still getting some powerful medicine. People are going to have to start asking, what exactly are we fighting? ----------


Off to catch the big one!

Hello everyone!

Well, it was some trip,,,,, and yes I did catch some fish. Person has to eat you know (smile).

Now,,,,, fishing is a slow sport at times and leaves time for conversation with others on deck. And because this little boat had room for more than two,,,,, there were a lot of Thoughts to talk about,,,,,, even during the dinners of our catch.

So, I be reading some of your recent conversation on the USAGOLD FORUM, and return to deliver some promised letters, thoughts and hikes. Good to be back (smile).

Thanks

A letter from Another to me.

My friend, I must now walk your trail in closer step. Events are closing that bring the changes we have long seen and prepared for. The time grows short as these conclusions prepare to make appearance. The last of these Euro price ranges are in sight and even the Duisenberg hints his work is done for this new currency. A hard task was completed by him, his acknowledge to the French in May 98 was with a timeframe few could understand. Now his containment is done. With introduction of notes and coins, this money will become it's own director and his work will be well received. A good day, indeed!

All were present at the meeting. I think contractual conversion became topic of some urgency. This BIS must now consider the values these forms will hold in ours and their new futures. Values that will no longer be dictated in dollars, rather realigned in conversion and gold market failure. Truly, this failure of current gold will be reflected as anguish in these western goldbugs, both bankers and investors. All done as the saving wealth for your gold advocates and new reserve bankers finds it's new mark in our time. Your work, good man, has been as trying to reconcile the religions of this world. Telling both they are just while only one can be right in the end. So it is in this day of gold.

Some knew what was coming from the beginning. With the Hague Conference of Heads of State in 1969 sprang Copenhagen Report of 23rd July 1973. We pointed and all continued to turn away to follow where power was, not where it was going. With the Solemn Declaration in Stuttgart (1983) closely followed by the Single European Act (1987) even the BIS then understood the final goal. Margaret (Thatcher) soon expressed that signing that proposition (the Solemn Act) was her greatest mistake in office. While I do agree with her on a strategic political basis, such reflections by British leader only exposes the ignored, nearing failure of their shared singular currency dominance (both USA and England). Little is expressed of the wealth lost of our peoples and that of most Western economies as these government's efforts to preserve this failing system drains real wealth from our world.

Now these leaders full attention must focus on this money transition itself as Blair's next initiative (the Euro) will lead to a realignment of contract values of all kinds. Before the fact! The Maastricht Treaty allows that by Jan. 2002, all contracts will be converted into euros and new contracts must be denominated in euros. Because Blair has overseen the signing of both Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, his closest people understand the full impact Britons intentions will have on this world's paper gold market. As it be contractually expressed in dollars. The credibility of these to not only represent gold but to maintain loan collateral on books will lead to several high level agreements to address this loss. Indeed, how does one transition a metal contract without moving the metal once again? Especially if the Euro suddenly, without explanation, rises in value. A rise that leaves only the door of metal fulfillment? All eyes must now search for a way to transition this beast as it's use and function will fall away as the Euro further expands. Some of your American gold must come into play during this game of kings. It must, as the BIS will sanction a complete disposal of contract liabilities from metal into Euros unless some real US gold is given up. Something your Bush will endorse but not without a price! As contract gold falls in price while expanding the physical price. I suspect it (official US gold) will be given up at the exchange rate of many thousands and even that will be the little drop of water that allows dollars to remain in this game. Our time arrives, my friend. Even as fools make effort to gain wealth in a gold market that will soon exist no more.

Tested now are the economies of both EuroZone and DollarZone with high crude values. The response of both is known. The ways of dollar wealth hasten their demise, even in the face of ECB restraint. Open and outright are they (FED) to discredit their position. This test is done and the verdict arrives soon. As with gold and oil, Dollars and Euros will neither any longer flow in the same direction.

Onward!

Hello everyone!

Keep an eye on any lose rocks and boulders, an earthshaking event could come at any time. While our walks follow historically proven paths, the destruction of many of today's fake trails may hinder our progress of understanding for a while. Big loses by people, both large and small, who don't own what they thought they own, usually cause them to panic down the hill sides. Right into our little physical world! (smile)

I know there are some hikers here that understand the flow of water and how it expands over a "flood plain". But, many do not or cannot perceive how physical gold will rise to seek it's own level. A level equal only to other gold, in the hand and very physical. Or at the very least, gold owned, deeded and individually partitioned in a secure account vault.

Onward:

I am taken by the mind that processes logic for it's own financial advancement. Usually, it (the traders mind) does a good job of gathering the facts, then inevitably it sees said illusion where reality appears. Even to the point of selling this same illusion to others that know it isn't there (smile). Our present gold market is just such a cloud on the wind.

All over this mountain there are guides that promote the huge overhang of contract gold. An overhang that has no real metal supply to settle it, if push came to shove. Even if a large portion of official gold was brought into play, the world paper gold market just could not be traded for real metal. On this most agree. Still, these same traders that understand and sell this concept, spend their days trying to know the exact time the default will occur so they can buy a bunch of paper contracts and profit. In their mind, they see that a major default will bring in an unlimited number of buyers. Both to get new contracts and to close out short positions.

In a very broad way, this view extends well into the rest of the not so visible gold market. The problem is that today, a timeline change in the currency markets is about to completely undo the end result of this strategy. The end result of this colossal change will break the gold markets into valuations of different amounts. Just like water, gold wealth of different properties cannot attain the same level. In the event of a large enough default, the entire world of paper gold trading will be forced into full cash settlement. The question will be presented: "if there isn't enough gold around to settle these commitments, then there isn't any point in letting the price rise further to effect still no metal settlement",,,,,,, " This was a contract trading market anyway, not a gold market"! Further, the international banking industry, in accords with their governments, will enforce a kind of "position limit" on the amount of gold liability they or their customers can carry. Both long and short. It will have nothing to do with the exchanges, rather it will be a bookkeeping problem being addressed by the banks. Still, it will impact the illusion price we use for gold,,,, downward. The net effect of this will be just the opposite of what paper gold players expect as positions are "force liquidated" prior to even a "cash settlement". This sudden dumping of major contract commitments onto the markets will drive the cash settlement price of gold,,,,, ?.

This is the reality of the political banking world we live in. Neither the EuroZone or DollarZone banking world is going to let the destruction of the Anglo/Dollar gold market shut down their financial system. Take some loses? Sure! But this portion of the pie is nothing compared to the troubles to be managed by the US (our Fed) as the dollar's roll as reserve is removed. Granted, once the game is underway a true Free Gold market, trading noncolateral gold, will come about. It will be endorsed as governments settle a small portion of their political scores using physical gold reevaluated up into the "low oxygen zone". Mostly it will be US gold being moved.

Further

These goldbug guides (mentioned above) are mostly playing for a currency profit, not gold. The same is true of "in the ground" gold advocates. While their profits and loses grow and fall in line with most gamblers, slowly, these players are losing credibility as the paper markets out play these goldbug's net worth. As events they expect to repeat are rebuffed by massive "cash backed" selling of paper gold, the expected "big" profits always fail to arrive. It's been this way for as long as Another said it would! Yes, something could change and send paper gold through the roof before anyone can stop it. If it does,,,,, good! Physical gold will do very well! But, I doubt these profits will ever be sent out as checks in the mail. Believe it!

Witness the recent long blowout of paper players on the comex? The so called "big traders" these guides thought were about to demand delivery. They were not the real "Big Traders" (I know) were they? If they were they would have demanded delivery even if the short side sold 500,000 contracts short. Even it they (sellers) drove the paper price down with empty sales! The reason these real gold advocates (Giants) buy physical gold is because they are waiting for this dollar casino of a gold currency market to shut down. This reality will end in a locked, no delivery market! Once again, Believe it!

Truly, this recent move was long "little traders" wanting to make currency profits without the real assets to back it up. Nothing more. We will see more of this as it all comes to it's end. When the real gold run Another points to comes,,,,, no one will profit anything near the amounts physical gold advocates will.

Keep climbing:

As I have said so often, the numbers we look at for today's gold price are an illusion. Because there is no real physical market large enough in scope to balance the paper trading settlement price. The price for physical gold unknown. To our advantage, gold is sold by past and present owners and this supply helps lend credibility to the market. Without it, we could not buy any gold, only cash settled contracts. A type of settled market that, if you read Another's letter, is not far away.

We all have trouble understand how there is no value known for physical gold. Yet, if we look at another market we could grasp this issue. Take American real estate:

We all have an idea what that house down the street sells for. But consider that that price does not reflect the true value of the physical house. Just watching the 30 year loan rate tells us where most home prices are going. I think (as an unreal example) almost every person would agree that is the fed went into the market to buy any and all 30 year house loans until the rates fell to 1%,,,,,, home prices would explode! Conversely, if all credit for houses was shut off,,,,,,,,, cash deals only,,,,,, home prices would crash!

How does this reflect on our gold market? We can see where a cash house is worth one price while a credit house is at a different level. The physical is the same even though means of trading and owning it generate an illusion value. You don't truly own a house brought on credit, in this light we can see that you live in something actually owned by the bank. But, you benefit by trading it if the price rises. Actually, currency profits from ownership illusion.

Our gold market has been in this same illusion fog for decades. The gold so many in the industry think they own and trade is truly just a commitment of another entity to supply you with said gold. By far, we buy, sell, lend and borrow something of an illusion. Paper trading dwarfs physical by an incredible amount. Mostly because the majority of us investors do not want to actually possess, and therefore use the physical gold. This price illusion is exactly the opposite of my above example. The credit gold price is driven far below the real gold price because supply is easily expanded to extend to anyone wishing to trade an illusion. You have just seen such an event on the US comex recently.

Other guides all point out that this cannot go on forever as eventually "Real demand usage" catches up with available "real supply". I agree. However, society has a way of changing the rules when the economic wealth that their savings are based on comes into risk. Our fiat banks will not be allowed to fail. Just as in 1971, when that real gold demand suddenly expands it's boundaries to include ordinary gold investors, the supply rules will be changed again. Fortunately for us Physical Gold Advocates, the next rule change will evolve from a reserve system that has no threat from a rising dollar gold price. Even if the contract markets crash and physical gold traded in Europe goes into the thousands, the Euro will find strength from such an occurrence. The ECB will embrase it and promote the same.

Dollar gold in the thousands,,,,,, USA inflation going hyper,,,,, The EuroZone dealing with the changes as the BIS settles all our gold dealings,,,,,,,,, And cheap Euro oil making sure Europe doesn't fail too.

Do I wish for this? Only a fool would comment to ask such a question. Am I preparing for this transition? Another would be happy to see that I am! (smile)

Thank you all for walking
I'm here for a while and will be adding more over the days

A discussion

-----Cavan Man (6/10/01; 19:35:39MT - usagold.com msg#: 55822)---It's getting dark on the gold trail.----------

Hello Cavan Man, let's walk a bit!

I just looked outside my cabin, here on the trail, and everything looks very bright to me. (smile)But one has to allow me that view as I saw this "New Gold Market" a long,,, long,,,, time ago and began making adjustments. Adjustments in the kind of wealth I own that would carry me for the whole trip. Not just these little side trails (trades) so many Gold Bugs are still trying to make pay off.

It is difficult for us to define, in explanation form, a new political perception as it evolves. Especially with old Gold players still presenting their gold views in a "has been context". Trying to explain the latest paper pricing moves as if it will fit into their past game plan. It doesn't and as time passes everyone is slowly seeing that something is changing. Michael Kosares has the best game for new advocates and I think some of them are now going that way. Just buy gold from a dealer that sees thru the fog and forget the stories of "has been leverage". True, that leverage payoff may somehow show up for a while, but none of these players will get much of a check compared to what's coming.

Yes, it is frustrating for anyone that cannot see the whole picture. Gold Bugs watch as their portfolios are further impaired as a result of investing habits that cannot evolve. Again, all based on old perceptions about today's gold. While I, too, enjoy watching TI (technical interpretations) and daily movements in the price functions of "gold substitutes",,,,,, none of this has any bearing on what "real gold" values are today or will later be as this all plays out. You see, the drama is in the political game and that game is what will determine how soon and by how much the "real value" of gold is displayed. Non the trillions of paper gold trades made around the world today, on this failing dollar gold market, can define the real value of gold.

Onward

By now everyone should understand that for every dollar that can be bet on a rising price of "paper gold"; three dollars can be made available to create and sell them the other side of that bet. When the big political moves come later and change our currency game, therefore our gold pricing game, this very same fiat contract creating ability will stand against your receiving the later value of physical gold. As expressed in a paper price.

Truly, the market is not manipulated so much as it has found a short term opposing balance. A timely political balance that has used this unlimited fiat creation as the gold price controller. A force being used to smooth a transition from one currency to another. Gold Bugs use this very same fiat creation to buy long "fiat gold contracts" and then complain because the banking reserve system, we all use can do the same. These "Anti Gold Bug" traders can create and supply just as much fiat power to sell us gold as we can use it to buy gold. Then when our futures / paper price remains the same and it's a cabal killing us. Actually, it's the modern Gold Bug's desire to shun physical gold ownership that's killing him as that desire was discovered and exploited for political means. It's free enterprise,,,,, Gold Bugs created a demand for something paper and a paper supply creation is delivered.

I marvel at how advocates of paper investing spend their time trying to determine when someone is going to buy up and corner this kind of paper market. Forget it, it's not going to happen. No one can force a paper market that has unlimited creation potential. And only a fool would try to demand delivery of a good he doesn't have the assets to pay for,,,,,, and do it in a market he knows doesn't have the metal to deliver. I know this, you know this, the government knows this and the Giants know it. Far better to just keep buying gold that will one day be correctly valued when this market's political use is done. So, have you somewhat positioned yourself for the great cornering of this "gold printing press",,,,, or are you more smartly playing the Kings game?

A few comments on your post items:

--- 1. Comex defaults.------

Yes, once again, here is an area that brings out the most impassioned analysis of most gold bugs. They all watch and wait for this big event so their paper gold substitutes can finally get them back to even. (smile) Still, everyone has their leveraged bets, in some form, waiting for the big one.

On a side note:

I smile at this because we read about the great percentage gains leveraged people are enjoying every time "paper prices" make a little move. Lost in the discussion is that this "New Gold Market" has removed such a tremendous percentage of their wealth already, that several 100% moves in these "gambles" would not make them close to whole. On a complete, long term Net / Net basis.

Someone points out their paper purchase at the lows of say, just a year or so ago, and they are now ahead and you could be too if only your ears could ignore Another. Ha! Ha! Or even buy the lesser metals, as that's where we will make it all up. Always lost in the logic is the fact that these "Gold Bugs" don't or won't advertise their previous adventures. In Hawaii (where I had lived in a small place for some time) the locals have a name for this "thought process"; "Ocean Money"! It floats in on the tide, rots a while, then floats out. (smile) They say:
"Look at that new guy, he's leaving town with a million! Must be a real successful Bro caus he only lost 9 mil to beach rot! Managed to keep some! Came here with ten million and now is on the airplane bragging to his friends. Talking about how they could leave the islands with a million too,,, if all those listening would follow his lead ////// they be rich too!
Ha! Ha! Cavan Man, I think you (and others) get my point as this connects to our new traders at the forum. With good instincts, they will rot only a little also.
(huge, oversized smile)

Climbing now

So what are we looking for when I watch the paper gold prices and comex? What gets me excited when the market begins a little move? Well, it's not the fact that it's going up, rather we are looking to see if the impact of political change is working the gold derivative's credibility yet? I am looking for some wild spurt of trading that lasts for several days or weeks. Open interest rapidly surging hundreds of thousands of contracts, then just as fast plunging away. A paper gold market, containing tremendous price changes ($100++ or more per day, both up and down) that begin to call into question the ability of Comex to function. Not so much question it's function as an price setting exchange, rather question if it can later function at all in the metal settlement process.

Where the big positions on the opposite side of the longs (shorts) find themselves in a changing world market without physical supply,,,, at almost any price. Brought on by a currency transition. Where big physical bullion dealings (one tonne ++) between real buyers and sellers,,,, outside and away from the exchanges,,,,, begins to run at a huge premiums to our contract based paper trades. Perhaps hundreds of dollars or percent higher,,,,, even impacting the ebb and flow in the coins world as misguided investors quickly sell for profits only to find no market goods later at twice the price.

In this environment, the big shorts on all paper based exchanges will be selling these new "cash created contracts" to the very limits of their capital. And trust me, they will not reach those limits because an unlimited amount of credit will be made available to them. Remember,,,,, for them,,,,, regardless of the supply,,,, the demand,,,, or the price of physical traded metal,,,, as long as the paper contract price doesn't close "up" too much,,,,, there is no risk or call on their capital. They can just keep on selling.

But, eventually (perhaps over only one day!) the outside the exchange demand for physical and it's escalating premium, will most likely see legal force from their physical buyers driving long players to demand delivery. Even if it cannot be delivered. Long,,,,,, longggggg,,,, before these delivery demands ever fully surface, comex will state position limits, cash settlement and trade for liquidation only. For you new people, this is exactly what they did during the Hunt silver fiasco. They have to do this because the articles these exchanges were created under manifest these trading places as price setting and price hedging establishments. Where the greatest majority of their trading is meant for cash contract settlement, not physical delivery settlement.

In this light, only Gold Advocates understand that default on Comex is really the forced non metal settlement of a contract at a contrived paper price. A price far below the physical traded price. Most likely a last day of trading price that settles out hundreds of percent below the world price for physical metal trading,,,,,, as it appears the very next day.

The big difference today (from the HUNT problem then) will be in the nature of this default. His was brought on by private investors buying a commodity. Today, gold market default and failure will be forced upon the dollar gold world by a sudden lack of "price setting" credibility. And that loss of credibility will stem from the stressed conversion of dollar contracts into Euro denominated units that demand "market based performance" (physical priced valuations) or an escalated (higher) Euro based cash settlement. This all will manifest in a lack of credibility in paper dollar gold trading that can no longer be marked to the market at the same value of physical gold.

This failure of price matching,,,,, this failure of contract conversion into metal,,,,,, this failure in the world gold market to any longer be able to correctly price real bullion,,,,,, will lead to a wholesale dumping of all dollar contracts that have US based performance,,,,,,and start a fall away of all dealings based on present protocols dollar market gold exchange.

As a side note: This will not apply to the paper silver markets as silver will not have the Euro vs. Dollar political struggle. A struggle where the ECB members are trying to loosen their main asset (gold) as a reserve wealth backing to replace the massive loss of dollar reserves. Remember, further back on the trail we covered how these reserve dollars will be simply cast down. In this light, silver trading will bear the brunt of selling in an effort to balance loses from a gold exchange that no longer works. Because silver has no hope of an official free market, it's paper pricing system may run amuck until it's price plunges to??? This is the reason so many countries that are contemplating a switch from dollar to Euro use are selling physical silver and buying gold (China, India, etc). It also explains to movement of gold between countries that planned outright Euro conversion.

Back to gold's paper pricing breakdown:

It will not lead to the collapse of world banking so much as it will lead to a reallocation of value between assets vs reserves. Which are and which are not. Further, a loss of paper exchange trading will drive gold to it's true physically traded price. Gold in the tens of thousands per ounce will represent:

First
,,,, it's real currency value in today's expanded fiat world,,,,,,, then later it will advance further on the price inflation coming to the USA. This is where so many thinkers cannot see super priced gold. They are seeing the present illusion of gold value as it's base. Later, a gold move from say, $10,000 to $20,000++ will only represent a 50% rise. Liken to an oh so understandable $300 to $600 today.

Second
,,,,, the total rejection of owning gold in any form except the real thing,,,, no amount of gold supply will come close to equalizing this current ownership imbalance built up over many decades. If anything, sellers will be confounded as nothing keeps pace with the gold rise. Once sold, it only costs double to rebuy.

Third
,,,,, a return of old world values in that gold is worth owning as a lifetime wealth asset beside your cash and other investments,,,,,, While the US will experience a massive retrenchment of it's wealth perceptions, our move into gold will be chaotic and traumatic. Other parts of the globe will fare well. Life will go on. Remember, people talk about how the US makes a quarter of the worlds products and services and say the rest of the world cannot do without our operating as usual. But, they forget that we consume all of it (that 25%) and then import more. Our production fall away will mostly be at the mercy of our own slow down. As the dollar tumbles on exchange markets, so too will our cost rise to produce anything (massive hyper price inflation). Rendering a net / net non gain in world trade advantage. In other words, our goods may very well rise in price faster than our dollar falls. If anything, we become even less competitive with Euro based production.

Further Onward

This new realigned price of gold will offer no threat to the Euro as it does to our Dollar. The open gold value calculations by the ECB proclaim their intention to allow gold to rise as a Euro enhancement. Not a Euro replacement item. Remember, old world values dictated that gold was
not a competing money any more than Microsoft shares are against the dollar today.

Gold, from times past was a wealth asset more so than it was in the form of money. Granted, it became the fastest moving form of wealth, but as it traveled on the road it was still simply seen as a tradable wealth. It has been American and Western ideals that made gold a lend able money and forced it's competition against failed currency systems. We set currencies in fixed gold amounts and then inflated the currency. No wonder gold competed against currencies. The ECB will allow gold to go to the moon and everyone will love them for it. People will use the Euro whether gold is at 1 Euro or a trillion.

Arguments against this new logic (by failing Gold Bugs) are little more than a throw back to their outmoded Western money logic. ET (a USAGOLD poster) even thinks that by freeing gold to rise to whatever level it wants,,,,, we are somehow governing it??? That direction of thinking is caused by "promoted investing". The logic is to somehow invest in gold (the industry or it's paper leverage) more so than owning the metal. Leaving the agenda of physical gold storage to be something the official governments or private enterprise should do for us. They base their concepts on a return of gold recognition as a somewhat official government money after price inflation discredits the local
currency (Dollars).

Such logic suggests we buy into the various SEC sanctioned (government) paper gold substitutes while governments somewhat allow a devaluation of their money against gold. Say to $800? In this way the dollar is saved a little while the gold exchanges continue life as before. This, my friend was a failure in the past and the future will provide a very different rendering.

Higher we go

We have named our big fish and it is Allan himself! The old Gold Advocate, from way back, that knows how to use gold as a system saving tool when backed into a corner. They have reclassified some of the American gold for use later. It is still ours now, to be sure and has not been swapped or sold. It was renamed with the full intentions of our ESF buying dollar reserves from Euro CBs (and others) as the Euro later gains usage (and value) independent of the dollar. In light of the Blair vote, I would rate their move as very smart. This was done (and will be done more so later) to provide backing and settlement against US paper gold commitments owed to and already delivered into oil ownership. This paper is mostly in Euro banks.

This was "part" of the price we paid for oil to flow in dollars this last decade as the Euro was born. This was the price we paid for an extension of dollar use in oil settlement. It will be moved when gold trades at a much,,,,, much higher price. It backs Another's point of long ago that oil was traded for gold in the thousands at that time,,,, we just had to wait for the real price to be shown. It will!

This is the decades long game we are playing for, my friend. This is the big one we own gold for. This will be the defining moment in our time that changes perceptions about the value, reserve currencies and the wealth of ages. Watch with me now, as events prove all things!

FOA gold trail msg#77 - A discussion-------

-------This is a misrepresentation of ET's position. ET stated that the (FOA proposed) restriction on using gold as collateral was a limit on the free market, and thus governing the gold market. ET's argument is for a totally free market.------------

No sir, I contend that "his position" itself is a misrepresentation of a free market. Attaching the rules
of credit principals to any tradable item subjects it to local contract law. As we have seen over the centuries, local laws inspired by the society of nation states always end up mired in further control issues. Usually it begins when someone or some large group cannot pay back the loan. In this case it would be gold. So the majority or most powerful institute round about measures that in the end
dilute the freedom of the market.

As it is, we as a people have not been exposed to the essence of free trade of almost anything for some time. It's no wonder that we rile against a concept that says we must be free, we cannot borrow or lend this sacred wealth of ages. In this day in time, a free market must have laws to truly make them free from themselves,,,,, less the advocates of "gold as money" storm the gates with entanglements that can only entangle further.

Promoting gold as money, even credit money is the very socialist ideas that always start out good to the ears and later cause men to chafe at the yoke of slavery.


Free Gold,,,,,, traded without credit,,,,, without the rules of men.

Well Ross,

You took the above item right out of my post and failed to attach the prior. Here is how it should read with the proper leading context:

-----They base their concepts on a return of gold recognition as a somewhat official government money after price inflation discredits the local currency (Dollars).

Such logic suggests we buy into the various SEC sanctioned (government) paper gold substitutes while governments somewhat allow a devaluation of their money against gold. Say to $800?

This, my friend was a failure in the past and the future will provide a very different rendering. -----------

Now,,,,, that's much better! (smile) My point was to reject the persons basic thrust of having gold as money again. Most of the modern ideas of "gold is money" advocates always want gold to be endorsed and stamped by officialdom to somehow make it "more real as wealth". They talk a lot about gold but always in the end return to these basic themes. Themes that always require more rules to enforce them.

This has been the killing problem for gold from the beginning. Men following a socialist slant while hiding behind the cloak of hard money. "We must lend gold" they declare, for it to truly be money. In effect these declarations plagiarize the wealth of gold by expanding the effect of it's use almost like inflating it! It's lenders have gold in the form of loans while the new ownership spends it until that expansion, too becomes permanent. Then we embark, once again on the road to inflating fiat
gold and breaking down the official money. The very thing hard money types always say can't happen but always does. Truly, if you want hard money, stop the socialist from borrowing and lending it. Think that hurts their basic thrust? Just listen to them rile against giving the people Free Gold to save and fiat to spend. Kind of kills the very leverage Western power was built on, doesn't it? (grin)

Further:
Using the prior gross misrepresentation, you presented Ross, as supporting evidence for your statement, also renders it a non-sequitur. Beside my poor wordmanship, bad english and rushed trail walk, I suggested nothing that didn't correlate against ETs views.

"Dawn of a New Gold Market"

Hello Randy,
How does it feel to do the thinking of 50 men and turn it all out under the name of one? Ha! Ha! Very good job, sir.

Your title above is so very fitting to the evolution at hand. I think things will begin to move considerably faster now that Blair is in the drivers seat. He is getting some moral help from Spain and Italy as these two members side more with opposing forces against the ideology of Germany
and France. This is so very healthy and is the basic foundation that makes the EU a world apart from single republic rule. Out of such broad based design comes a more equal system that all nations can hope to deal with.

Here is a sample of some recent commentary:

-----------------
CNE NEWS - May 21st 2001

Spain Alone No Longer

It's always good to have friends in high places and with Berlusconi leading Italy, Spain's Jose Maria Anzar will finally have some conservative company in the EU. John O'Sullivan, editor-in-chief of United Press International, who previously held posts at the London Times and the London Daily Telegraph, notes that "Until now Spain was the only major nation in the EU with a conservative government. Now he has a powerful ally in intra-European disputes." O'Sullivan further notes Berlusconi is "an Atlanticist as much as he is a Europeanist" and that both Berlusconi and Anzar have more politically and ideologically in common with America's George W. Bush than with Germany's Gerhard
Schroeder or France's Lionel Jospin. ------------------------

Good stuff, right? This kind of balance will allow Blair to sell the union in a better image. England truly will not be the only non conforming member. I also think that the time is right for the ECB to gun the Euro. Another said as much and suspects the recent BIS meeting was a prelude to this new initiative.

Now with Bush being killed in their public opinion, especially with his "socialist steel" stance. Oh boy, the shoe is on the other foot now. Expect our gold markets to begin to reflect these incredible power struggles by locking down the real supply as this year runs by.

----I have not had the temerity to ask before but I have often wondered why the U.S Government couldn't adopt a similar policy, that is , mark the US gold to market and therefore cover a lot of the excess dollars. I guess you hint as much as when saying that Greenspan knows how to use Gold when backed into a corner. I can't quote the exact figures,but the U.S. theoretically still holds quite a lot of gold( valued at $42?). Not quite as many tons as the combined European totals but still quite a lot.-----------

Hello Camel,

The US could have did this very same revaluation in 1971. But they blew it! The problem then would have been that the dollar would have been marked way down on the common exchange rate systems in force at that time. We would have had a gold backed dollar at say, $3,000 oz, but also a tremendous price inflation as the dollar's buying system repriced itself via other trading blocks. So we decided to stiff the world because we wanted to retain the great life style our overprinting of dollars brought us. Simple yes?

The problem was, and still is that the world started working on a new currency right then and there. It took a long time. Today, no other nation in the world will accept the US's promise to back our dollars with even $20,000 gold. Because it would be meaningless. We would just do the same thing again. After all this work, better to arrive at the door step of a better system and just walk on in (grin). Couldn't be any worse. Besides, at least the ECB is flashing the gold light at everyone that wants Free Gold. Believe me, that bunch includes a large segment of world population.

Further, besides,,,,,,,,, would the US really ship their gold out if asked? (smile) No, my friend, we will be forced to ship gold slowly as dues to just keep out dollars as trade vehicles. Lesser vehicles to be sure, but sovereign money never the less.

One more thing Sir Camel,
It would be almost impossible for the US to defraud investors holding an IOU for gold in the form of a gold backed currency (the dollar),,,,,, then later return this very same currency back into gold loan status. As I understand it, every BIS member (outside the US of course) would demand their dollar reserves replaced at the old gold rate. Now, that ain't gona happen. The best the US could
do would be to print a new currency. Still, once taken,,,, never again? (grin) Thanks Camel

Some Australians know what's coming

Hello Max,

Yes, the whole mine sector is up to it's ears in bank dealings. Even the US fund favorite, NEM, has enormous debt. Yes, it's regular debt but we have to expect that every financing function in the industry will be in hot water once these BBs start suffering. Loans, both good and bad will be
called because everyone will be exiting a sector that is suddenly seen as in turmoil.

Once the largest cross segment of our gold market starts to fail, taking paper prices to the pits,,,no one will want to chance holding mine paper of any kind. Even if physical is soaring. Fact is, at first, no one will believe the new price is real and will not bit the mines that credit. They will mark the mines to the comex price first.

Let's face it, industry supporters unleash their strongest attack at the notion that the marketplace could be in trouble. This is the area that they know is their bread and butter as far a stock valuations and new credits are concerned. We will never get an honest take on the risk with that much on the table.

Gold Bugs like to point out that the mines could just use their metal as money. But, with all the cross ties in the gold lending business,,,,,,, the various governments tax policies at odds with non legal tender accounting and in general the failure of knowing what price of gold would be,,,,,, this avenue of metal use would be closed for some time. The banks would forbid it.

This is the reason I invest a very small portion in the best of the industry. I expect it to pay off, only after the mines valuations fall far away first. Later,,, after big taxes,,,,, the very best mines left may make some fantastic profits on the last $2,000 and ounce. That's giving at least $18,000 to the government. (grin). Besides, what a head throb? Just buy gold outright.
Thanks Max.

Hello Mexpat,
you write:

------I like it! I like it a lot. But I find myself wondering just how the wealth value of this free,
tradablevgold would be determined vs. other assets, and vs. the fiat currencies which would still be used for daily commerce. Would you see some type of Exchange still existing which would handle transactions in physical Free Gold between miners and end users, for instance, at which a daily
price in some fiat currency would be set? Or how would it work do you think?------

Well,
I expect gold to be a wealth holding no different than,,,,, stocks that pay no div.,,, antiques that have no earnings,,,,,, diamonds that buy us love,,,,,, treasury bills that are brought at a discount and appreciate over time,,,,,,,,,, raw land,,,,,,, and cash in a box!
I do not expect it to be used as daily money any different than shares of IBM are used to buy food. I think we will hold it for it's record over time as the best trade able tangible asset one can own. I expect taxes will be levied on it's use if it is traded. No different than the taxes people record the world over when taking and paying cash in commerce.

Your post:

-----If I want to trade some of my shiny gold eagles for a beach front condo in Veracruz, priced in pesos, how am I going to determine how many of my eagles to give up? I'm trying to envision just how things might work on a practical basis once physical gold breaks free from paper gold.
Perhaps you could comment.-------

If you have a good relationship with a physical gold dealer he would sell the gold for you or perhaps just charge a trading fee to record and ship the gold to your property's seller. Your paper records would suffice for paying the correct taxes. Not much different than trading physical now???

One big difference will be that Michael will most likely be part of a physical gold dealers group. Perhaps called the EGBE (Euro Gold Bullion Exchange). An organization of world physical dealers that buy and sell gold for their customers. MK would, instead of checking the comex price, simply call a nearby (in denver) member and deal the metal or get a going price.

From South Africa to Shanghai,,,,,, from Berlin to Dubai,,,,,, the new physical exchange will change the dynamics of gold as never before.

Will this work for you, sir (smile). Thanks MexPat

Meg,

do you know how many national currencies in the world today experience an average of over 20% inflation rates? Do you know how many of those nations also experience almost hyper rates? More than a few, my friend. The point is that even in super inflation dynamics, modern people still use the fiat. Even as the governments lob off zeros weekly. Sure everyone has gold and hard dollars,,,,, but they don't spend them as much as they do their currency notes.

My point is that we will all be doing just as in Mexico; spending pesos while holding dollars and gold. Only in America we will be saving gold, putting aside Euros and spending inflating dollars. When the dollar goes completely hyper, we will resort to Euros, not gold or silver. The times have changed, my friend, you are fighting a war that will not begin. The world will use only one hard metal as wealth, gold! Because as Randy puts it: " we don't need a redundant wealth asset to hold in reserve". Silver is a good commodity but has no future in the either the Euro System asset structure or my private wealth. Gold is the place to be and the events to follow will show this to be true.

Hello again Randy,

Yes, Duisenberg will be leaving and will have guided the hardest portion of Euro formation; the initial expansion. Once the currency is finally in circulation, this balancing act will end. I think Trichet will then have the most satisfying portion as he powers the Euro into world class status. It's hard to believe that this group of nations is such a power house. This bit of info makes a startling point:

"When the national aid programs of the 15 member states are included, the EU provides 55 per cent of the world's development aid and 66 per cent of outright grants".

So much for the idea of a broke bunch of countries.

Also; yes again that the ECB is holding firm in it's position of being non political . No grand show of cutting rates to pump the economy at the expense of the currency. Traders like to dismiss this body as ineffective because they have not produced the currency valuations that put money in their personal derivatives trades. Instead this Central Bank is following a course that is putting them in
good standing with major dollar reserve owners. Owners that are now voting with their feet to exit the dollar as markets allow. It doesn't take much view to see that a further rise in oil prices is about to push the US well over the cliff. To date the impact has been muted with the EuroZone showing
about as much impact as the US. It will be the next rise the shows the difference and much more greatly impacts the dollar's standing.

With Blair beginning his Euro pitch, expect an all out effort out of Europe to remove gold off the market now,,,,, a certain firmness in the Euro and an outright overt push by the US fed to gun the money supply at all costs.

The combination of all this should break the US paper gold pricing system, drive US inflation rates well past the Euro rates (even making a joke of the CPI numbers), raise all prices in local US investments such as Real Estate, and the Dow. and drive real bullion premiums through the roof
(over paper contracts).

We have been on the road to high priced gold for some time and now should begin to see the results spill over. It's going to be some history lesson.

--------However, I cannot agree with you that in such a regime, gold to save and fiat to spend, there will be no gold loans. If it is in people's interest to borrow or lend gold, then they will do that, no matter what the government proscription against it. If the pressures are great enough there will be a black market. -------------

Thanks for reading sir!

Did you know that in most countries around the world, the US dollar is not legal tender? Yet, it is brought, sold and traded just like it was. Central banks own dollars as reserves and allow their local use do to IMF treaties and accords. Still, most major countries don't legally recognize our currency as money in their economic system.

All this and we can circle the globe and use dollars almost anywhere. Why is that? Because the dollar is covered by a US law that makes it the money within the domestic US. It's not a law in any other land but it binds the dollar's use as a protocol of understanding.

Now, if gold was to be declared non tender and non collateral in Euroland, the same force that binds us to use dollars the world over would also repel us from contracting in gold. The world over. The legal status of a major reserve nation can have the effect of internationalizing a law into policy with respect to the conducting of business.

In other words, I'll lend you some gold here in Brazil, but you will not get a good rate because of the risk I take that you may end up in Europe where I could not enforce my right to that collateral. Better you borrow these pesos or Euros at a lower rate, yes?

This is how a local law becomes accepted protocol in business dealings the world over. Besides, why would it be in anyone's best interest to borrow gold when they could borrow fiat? Truly, if fiat is the money, like the dollar fiat is today, modern people will borrow it first, no?

Gold find's itself in it's current predicament because it still competes with the dollar. In a Euro world, it won't be in that box.

ORO (06/13/01; 00:09:42MT - usagold.com msg#: 56002)
FOA, Another, and the use of force

Hello ORO,
I have a few points to make. You write:

============
--------- I say again, no financial system has survived the span of three years, and most had not survived a year without trading gold at a set par to financial assets. The future euro system presented by Another and FOA is no different from its failed predecessors. ----------------

The problem with this comparison, ORO, is that no financial system has ever been introduced where gold is included as a non money reserve asset. Taking your point further; this oversight is the reason "every financial system" has failed. Not just those lacking gold. In this light the new Euro
system is different from any major reserve fiat ever employed in modern time.

Through out history "hard money socialist" always fought to include gold in the currency / banking system so they had an escape rout. None of them ever could live with gold moving through society as a singular wealth asset that was traded next to cash. Making it an alternative pay as you go, non
credit, pull up your own bootstraps way to survive man's money systems. Sure, taxes would be paid on this very asset every time it was used. But, that fee is no where close the wealth tax burdened upon the economy by an exclusive arrangement that combined gold and money. Then common people had no recourse to own a wealth that could offset the social printing press as man inflated the official gold backed money.

In hind sight we now know that the flaw in the system was in allowing gold to be entangled in the basic purpose of banking,,,,, lending. This opened the door to social engineering; in that lent gold could become a permanent fixture in the national money supply by simply printing more gold than was held.
===========

--------- The core of the argument from Another and FOA is the FORCED liquidation of contracts having dollars on one side and gold on the other. The mechanism for this is not related to performance on the dollar side, nor to the particular degree of leverage in the bullion banking
sector, or any market set rate of exchange between euro, dollar and gold, but solely and completely by action of law (the EU treaties) to FORCE GOLD CONTRACTS IN LONDON
TO BE CONVERTED TO EURO.-------------------------

Oro, this is the core as you see it. A distinct Western view that incorporates the need for inflating qualities in a money system. We never said that this drive was about bringing the Anglo based gold lending system to justice? I'll leave that to GATA. We seek to dismantle it entirely and hang the cost upon whoever will carry them. Looking beyond your closed understanding one can see the need for change.

The USA initiated the idea of "Forced liquidation of contracts" in 1971, when they defrauded the world of it's gold. Their's was also a "sole action of law" that forced gold owners the world over to become US fiat holders. Further, this was done while the US kept it's gold ownership illegal for American citizens. So much for a Republic that plays a tune to the world of how a money system should run? To the Europeans credit, the destruction of this current breed of "American gold Tender" will at least offer a new currency that recognizes the asset value of gold and encourages it's ownership by the masses.

This combination was not contrived lightly and is the desire of peoples the world over. Nation states that wish to thrust the American experiment onto it's home turf. Truly, I don't blame them. Let us Americans print our own destiny, but leave the world to it's gold.

Besides, how else could one divest themselves of Dollar gold paper without moving into gold itself or another currency unit large enough for the task.
============

------The reaction to this plan would not be the one the EU intends. The contracts would not convert into euro but instead leave the EU jurisdictions even if the UK joins the euro.-------

Your position is based on current context. This drama will appear different as it unfolds. US inflation will be driving upward, it's economy slowing and our Fed printing like mad. This very trend is currently on track as we and others have been pointing out. No one thought that Allan would embark on such a confidence killing rout and it is the bankruptcy of American financial policy that is driving this. The dollar is at the end of it's timeline and our expansion of derivatives was but an effort to save the system for a while.

Let's see; you have a gold loan on the books, physical supply dries up forcing a premium on metal over contract gold, the contract and futures markets freeze up and your asset in the form of loan paper is worth zero. Then the ECB in conjunction with the Euro faction of the BIS offers to restate the now worthless gold loans into Euro denominations and you are going to walk? Where? To the US?

In this context, the next reserve system is saving a portion of assets that were already destroyed by US special interest. US policy destroyed before the fact as much as the US printing presses destroyed the dollar gold ratios in 71. Think again, my friend.
================

------------There is nothing that would force gold producers or buyers to go to London or Zurich to do their trade. As both groups would prefer to go to alternate jurisdictions. Seeing the forced redenomination of contracts coming would simply leave the euro using jurisdictions which threaten
to change their contracts by force. -----------

As I said above, no one is going to force anybody. Producers and buyers will head for the best system and in this case it will be the only one in operation.

------------Furthermore, the contracts remaining in EU jurisdictions would be hedged into euro liabilities of ECB member banks long before the fact. This is something I believe was done leading into 1999, whether this hare brained plan goes through or not. --------------

At the very least gold assets will balance a portion of this. We never said that the Euro would not have to expand greatly to cover the dollar's removal from reserve status. It will. It was never intended for the world to lose trillions of dollar assets and not have at least a few trillion of that replaced by Euro System liabilities. As I pointed out so many times, the coming rise in gold will at
first only be reflecting past dollar expansion that took place without real gold pricing to track it. The illusion of gold price we today call accurate will give way to recording just how much the US over borrowed itself. This rise in gold is the real base the Euro will expand on in an effort to fill the world hole left by a fallen dollar. At the very least the EuroZone is not trying to create an illusion of Euro power without gold rising to reflect that. All so very contrary to past American dollar policy.

-------Thus a euro - gold pump would have been created with FURTHER EURO AND DOLLARS being created for each rise in the gold price in either. Thus a gold market boom would be against the interests of both the ECB and the Fed. -------------------------

Again, your idea of a Euro gold pump completely misses the root cause of this new gold price in the first place. It will be but a recognition of dollar failure and a replacement of those lost values through high priced gold. Both official and private gold the world over will represent asset wealth lost by the dollars demise. At first inflation will have nothing to do with $10,000+ gold. The dollar has already seen to that. To say this is against the interest of the ECB is to ignore both logic and our modern economic reality. Yes, there is a major problem being fixed and the FED and American Social engineering at the world's expense is that problem.

-----------Contrary to the thinking in political circles in Europe, the markets are more powerful than they are and will move to destroy the credibility of their plans just as they destroy the credibility of the Fed if it continues to inflate beyond debt repayment demand. --------------

No sir, contrary to political thinking in America, Europe and most of the world sees how the US market is manipulated in a way that ignores all past Fed inflation. We continue to move the money supply bar upward in an action that says "you just inflate one more time and it's all over boy"! As if all the past dollar wealth destruction is ok. Truly, the feds credibility is already destroyed even as they now embark on the final inflation. Your observation of markets ability to destroy credibility is a joke that has been circulating for decades now. Your faith is in a market that exists in illusion for the good of political advancement. Witness Bush's backtracking on numerous items of ideology
importance. And he is the best conservative this nation can put in place.

--------------That the ECB member central banks were supplying this physical gold liquidity at par with the paper would make the ECB (and EU and the euro) more suspect than the paper gold - future dollar exchange system they are trying to destroy. ---------------------

Who said it was at par? If you are speaking of the current illusion of price, then par is most certainty above that. You don't know who brought the gold if it moved outside the world CB system and you don't know the full extent of assets traded. Both gold and currencies are traded with perceived future value in mind. Especially gold that is known to be revalued later.

-----As FOA indicated, the paper system is such that unavailable gold is traded for unavailable dollars - future gold delivery is traded for future dollars earned. As the (previously) future dollar earnings do not appear, neither does the demand for making good on the contract with physical gold delivery.----------

Yes, and this structure is the market you promote that can shake governments to the ground. Truly, once the gold supply is locked down, the demand side of these phantom price setting contracts will dislocate the entire gold market place. Your capital seeking the best return will, at this time of stress, opt for any market that works at all. Much less works at a profit.

---------There is always a difference between gold (savings) and other financial assets (investments). Gold holdings remove consumption demand from current goods and services, thus allowing their use in investments that produce future goods and services the excess of future products over those used in investment is the return. The value of gold credit vs physical gold, as is the case for all credit, is simply the reflection of the ratio of expected future production of goods and services to current production of goods and services.----------------

Not true in the context of today's economy. These rules have been rebuffed by the markets failure to destroy non performing assets in the face of government bailouts. Fiat policy under our reserve system expands and retains all forms of created production, no matter the return. Capital has no risk basis to regulate it's flow. We expand until the currency is dethroned. All the while common man has no wealth storage unit to transcend the process.

In today's fiat systems, consumption moves right thru gold holdings as the assets used to buy them are deployed by the metal seller. Gold credit is not needed in our fiat world because it's function is replaced by fiat credit. What is lacking is gold in a non credit stance so savers can store wealth outside it's relationship with money. Once gold is removed from competition with fiat, the return on gold is in regaining the inflation wealth lost to credit and the wasted production assets such credit made permanent. This is the reality of our common money world today. We will never return to anything that decreases our creations. With this concept now a law of human function we strive to live with it. In this, gold will be our anchor in the present, future and beyond.

----------Gold is and has been the only money of substance. A currency not attached to it will not be borrowed because it will not be lent. None wish to hold a perpetually diminishing asset such as a currency denominated contract detached from gold would be. Countries that impose capital
controls lose in the financial market place and become economically isolated. Even the EU can not afford that.------------

Credit money systems will be with us for our lives and beyond. They will all fail, taking gold with them if gold is entangled in man's credit schemes. In modern minds money is not money unless it is entwined with credit. In this perception lays the trap that renders gold to never be a money substitute again.

The fact that our Dollar use has expanded the world over for almost 30 years without being tied to gold rejects the logic ORO implies above. There is a whole world of people, savers and businessmen that have and still use our "perpetually diminishing asset". Even as it is detached from anything hard. Further, Capital controls are only controls when they prevent socialists from inflating gold for their self serving interest. For the benefit of our present world trading structure, let's strive to replace the flawed, failing dollar with one that allows savers the right to retain their hard won wealth. Let the these Western Capitalists work the fiat tools they enjoy and for them may the best gamble win. Just leave my wealth so it may travel the trail I seek it to go.

For Gold Advocates, the Gold Trail is the only road to security.

Once again, we talk,

ORO (6/13/01; 01:10:10MT - usagold.com msg#: 56006)
FOA, Another - Fallacies in economic arguments

--------The crux of the matter is that the unit of savings dictates the unit of contract denomination (including debt), which dictates the transactional unit. The markets function best when all are the same units, and when the markets are free to switch between monetary units as reality requires. ------------

This "crux of the matter" is that Western hard money proponents always use an ill-defined definition of peoples wealth. Such ideology segments our savings into money form. This makes the distinction that only money can be the topic and concern of a societies ability to determine what it's worth is and what it can spend. Reasoning that units of savings do have to be in the form of transactional bits
enslaves us into some form of money system. This thrust ignores the fact that our total wealth is just as spend able and tradable for other wealth and therefore is our life's savings also. Money is but a function of denominating said wealth. In this light, history has proven that when real wealth units are combined with our credit money, credit inflation blurs our ability to measure our worth.

To say that markets function best when free to shift denomination power between fiat and gold ignores the fact that when combined there can be no shifting. Further, credit money has always been in a process of credit inflation decay and can hardly be seen as "functioning best"!

---------- The idea of separating the unit of savings from the units of contract and transaction can only result in no contracts and no transactions, or no savings in the unit dictated. In reality, transactions and savings would move out of the euro into gold (all transactions in euro would be
followed by exchange into gold), and contracts would simply not be signed within EU jurisdiction where they could be annulled, but signed under a "tax haven" law-------------

No one has this idea in mind. Your point is given in the context of gold being some form of money unit. It will not. I will be free. Once again, we have been contracting in gold - less fiat dollars for decades and no savings have rush out of this currency away from dollar contracts. The logic is lost in that a blind man can see where contracts and transactions have continued. If this was true the world would have ran from US legal tender jurisdiction and traded in all the other forms of money. Especially after our 1971 repulsion of gold as a contract able US money substitute. The rest of your paragraph rebuffs a condition that will not exist once gold is outside the money arena. Besides, once again, if this loss of function didn't happen to the dollar why should it suddenly happen to the Euro.

-------The similarity of the Indian gold and contract markets to this UN-free-gold idea goes far beyond goldfan's observation. The limitations on contracts, business formation (80% of Indian business is done without license and without enforceable contracts), and private property in India are exactly what has kept so much of India in its poverty stricken state. That is the true alternative to the so called "Western" view of money. That is what you say Europe is working towards. If so, I wish them a quick and painful demise such as they intend to impose on their own people and those of the world at large.---------

Your wish for destruction stands you at odds end against the desires of a good portion for the world. The alternative to our Western experiment with money is to retrieve gold from the clutches of this same Western banking establishment. The very same group your failed hard money position seeks to have us all try once again. Europe is working to place gold in the hands of common man, not again on the books of credit lenders.

On the contrary, to have the world's money system remain attached to the social policies of USA socialist interest would indeed place us in the same stricken state of India. To connect to complete economic policy of India to the proposition of Freeing gold from Western inflationist completely out of context.

------ The dollar gold market of today allows a fixing of the profit of any dollar investment into gold. That is the key for its survival. The euro system as you present it does not, and intends to make that impossible. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of its purposely inflating the gold
banking system, and its intended puncturing of the paper gold bubble it induced, the EU and its financial institutions will destroy confidence in them as all will know what they did, how they did it, and that they are as honest and trustworthy as the Gandhi's and Nehru's political progeny.------

"the key for its survival"?? Knock, knock,,,,, is anybody home there? Am I talking to the same person? (smile) No comment on that one.

As for your "purposely inflating the gold banking system", I made the point in the last reply that this is but a reflection of dollar expansion, not Euro inflation.

Time and events will prove that the world wants and needs a currency governed by a varied group of nations. Collectively able to leave their ECB central bank to reign in on Western style inflation as it see fit. With free gold to gauge that success and an already obvious passion to under inflate our
Fed, the trend now points to the next choice the world will run to. The Euro. Honesty and trustworthy will be judged in relation to the US, I'm sure.

------As to the legal status of the dollar as a gold unit, it is not. -----

That's obvious now but was not the case in 1971. Would anyone accept the dollar as backed by gold again. It would be a laughing stock.

--------The legal gold unit is the Eagle, and the dollar is legally silver. All of the congressional commitments of the dollar as a gold unit, and of the various administrations making Executive Orders, were purposely kept strictly illegal so that a future Supreme Court could annul them and all treaty obligations that involve a connection between the dollar and a particular quantity of gold--------

Yes, apply your 'honest and trustworthy" to that one.

Hello again everyone.

Before restarting my comments on ORO's posts, I want to define some thought. I'll begin with a portion of earlier posts that actually marks the ground in my struggle to open ORO's position. With Econoclast first, then expand from there.

-----I feel discouraged right now. Not because the gold price is low, not because of what is happenning in the gold market, and by extension the financial world, but because of the fact that what I see for the future is more of the same.--------

My friend,

our message and our position is that we are in one of the most exciting times of all the history of gold! We have seen that during times with the most radical transitions, the majority are usually defending the wrong asset (added note: and often hard money position). This unfortunate situation need not impact everyone today. If better judgment is the result of a full understanding, then some who read here will be exposed to tools that could help them avoid the mistakes of our Western hard money majority.

For Western Gold Bugs today, their culture, their system and their recent knowledge is all ensconced within the last 30 years of paper wealth. Yet they are using a hard money defense, written by masters preceding our modern era. They struggle to use that logic out of context, as it is thought to apply to this gold market today. These two precedents are leading them to reflect their gold values in some form other than physical ownership in possession. This mistaken detour from gold's true purpose will once again prove, by reality, the value of owning real gold.

Standing aside this group is the Physical Gold Advocate. For them, for us, these times will contain the greatest gain in real wealth ever seen. For those who are falling behind, gold is still within your grasp.
TrailGuide
-----------------------------------

OK, with that thought in place let's go further.

I have, in the past, both here and on the trail, offered a small bit of our perception of gold as it was understood by mankind of the ages. Gold use from the very beginning and covering hundreds and hundreds, even thousands of years ago. Those partial glimpses of our research are of a timeline in
history that far out lives the life of our present era. In truth, we are living only a tiny portion of mankind's experiment away from using real wealth and assets for buying and selling goods and services.

In today's society, ours is a grand trial of pushing reality behind and has gone far beyond the conservative money movement's limited condemnation of present policy. Yes, we as a society and even this hard money school have bastardized the very thought of gold. Standing logic on end in an attempt to give gold a better taste to the masses. A "taste" that has ended in both hard and soft money failure time and again.

Gold was given over to the sway of bankers and expansionist, long before we thought fiat money was bad. Gold was renamed money by those who in our present day would be considered "the iron work" of hard money thought. The name change was not intentional but the effect was the same. The ancients could not condemn or stop this transgression as it blurred the distinction between wealth and money. Over time they called it wealth no more.

This is the real war, the real threat to gold and it's lifelong attributes that thru war and life saved generations of our forefathers from poverty. Yet today, our experiment has ran far beyond even that early fraud. For so long have we been without gold as wealth, we look back and see gold as
money as the safe place to be. It is not and never was.

From this understanding we know that our present grasp of man's view of gold is far different in scope than back then. As I pointed to above, the culture of Western Gold bugs today is completely embodied in monetary rules, laws, human interactions and history as it is known to them during this
age. Yet that knowledge is a school of hard money that was built on that shaky foundation that preceded it. Again, "gold is money" does not bring us sound money. It only sets the stage for another round of the failure of man's idea of how a money system should be.

Yes, we struggle to use this hard money logic because it is out of context, as it is thought to apply to this gold market today. A "New Gold Market" I might add that confounds every expert in the field. Indeed, our logic today is out of context with what gold was always needed for; a wealth held
by mankind because it so much reflected the opposite of our human failures with credit. No matter if we lent pigs or goats, wheat or steel, bonds or stocks, fiat or houses,,, carts or horses to rocks and fire,,,,,,,,,, credit is the failure of man's control of himself. And always will be. The one item of wealth that so stood the storm of our greed was the same item that most marked that failure to market,,,,, Gold! Yet, even gold will not do the job our creator made it for if it is entangled in man's evil nature.

It is from this rock I make my stand,,,,, It is here where we thrust our sword deep!

Onward to ORO's post.

Hello ORO,

------
ORO (6/13/01; 03:47:52MT - usagold.com msg#: 56010)
FOA, more Fallacies - the "Western" view-------

------- The alternative to the "Western" view of money is millenia of decline and stagnation. Which is what we had before we had the "Western" view and the "West".------------

ORO, it's important to understand that most of what the "West" is built on is financial debt without human assets. Only people can create wealth with energy, thought and movement. Without a populous standing behind our huge American debt, it's payment reverts back to increasing the
bookkeeping value of all tangible wealth through fiat inflation.

All this debt we created brought us a lifestyle that is an illusion built on the backs of those that brought that debt. They traded real efforts to enhance our position and no will receive inflated assets that reflect said inflation. Even the gold at West Point will be inflated to match some of that debt.

Truly, the expenditure of so much of the worlds productive efforts on producing our Western Way,,,,, cannot be in any way be less than "decline and stagnation" before the fact. Yes, it is indeed our view of money that created this fraud and the whole world will pay something to end it.

--------------As I said earlier this early morning, the role of money is to be held not for its own utility for its holder but for its utility in conducting trade over time and space - particularly over long distances and times. Whatever it is that is used as money - for savings, concurrent transactions and contracting (transactions completed in the future) - will be used predominantly for that purpose, and
its value will be set by the markets at a sufficiently high price (relative to everything else) to keep it in use as money rather than an industrial, consumer, or collectible good.------------The whole idea of money is that it is what you hold instead of holding "wealth": the goods you intend to buy at some point in the future or in some distant location. -----------

Ha! Ha! I could not have said that more eloquently. What you have described is the exact workings of a modern fiat system. This is also necessary for the very financial foundation that modern man has created and demands your same present fiat credit structure. I have pointed to this
many times. Modern fiats are the life blood of modern commerce and even modest inflation is accepted as a tax to pay it's way. Nothing else could explain this evolution better than for us to witness the dollar's demand evolution during the last 20+ years. Even our dollar bears are
confounded by it.

Our dollar would have worked very well within this framework if we had only allowed gold to run outside the money system. Priced as wealth not credit money. But, then again, such a setup would not have brought The American Experience others envy so much. A constricted money supply and low dollar exchange rates would have measured our profligate ways quickly and driven us into the very decline and stagnation you mentioned above. A fitting judgment for a nation that would not pay it's own way.

As a side note: Yes, many fathers in this land, no doubt paid some form of war blood for the world to be better. But how can we measure the wealth loss placed upon everyone by our system of exchange robbery. For how long is the financial pay back? Would it not have been better to reign
in the dollar long ago? We cannot judge what was not done.

-----Anyone holding anything as money - or a financial asset - will be holding it for what it may buy rather than for what it is. In your old demonstration of the people in the audience of an auction saying "I could afford this" while reviewing in their minds their financial holdings you missed the point entirely; that is the perpetual condition of the saver. Whether he saves in gold or in dollars (a poor choice) or in euro (if what you say pans out then it is an even poorer choice), the saver is making the decision not to buy the Strad at the auction. He is the one making it possible for the price to be as low as it is. If he had no confidence in his savings (and investments) whether gold,
currency, or anything else, he would most definitely have bid the whole of his holdings for the Strad, perhaps even pooling his money with others at the auction to bid together at the limit of their assets. What you are, in effect, demonstrating is the role of money as savings.----------

ORO, if that were fully true then the dollar system as it is would have been decimated long ago. True, we hold and value a fiat currency today for it's use, and value in this modern society. What it can do for us, yes. And this need has evolved as our economic structure has evolved. Still, our
human "credit use flaw" is the force that even tremendous economic and financial advancements cannot neutralize or overcome.

Mankind, as we are designed, needs a tool that can both save and measure his and his countries "credit fault level" before it destroys his wealth. Gold is that saving grace but can not and will not work it's magic if entangled within the same credit structure we strive to control. Most leading
currency advocates (even Allan) look at many private use items outside of fiat to see how their money control is working. Real estate, cars, oil, food, you name it and none of these are part of the money structure. Gold as a private and official wealth asset, instead of money credit asset can also serve that function and more so. But we have to get beyond this wreck of a dollar system that's speeding out of control.

The only thing that did not bring down the dollar sooner was it's societies lack of said measurement tools to see their miss allocation of credit. Let's face it, in the same light as I pointed out further up, we continue to think that we are leading the world in lifestyle example. Because gold is mired in it's own financial evolution that started with money credit, it's price illusion tells everyone we are the
best! ORO, even a crazy society will back away at some point, especially if they have some saving asset we know will make it through any storm.

We have gone so god awful far off the scale of how even a blasted fiat should work it is stunning. And it can all be laid to rest at the door of gold is money theory. From that point our ability to manipulate both fiat and gold values ran amuck. And will do so again. History proves I am right on this count.

Still, a fiat can and will work for us if it's modern use demand is harnessed. It's value can be somewhat maintained without locking down our governments and societies needs for flex ability. In this light Free Gold can slow a car (future Euros) gaining momentum down a hill. But, given the speed this train (dollar) is going down the mountain is it no wonder evan gold is cast aside as an anchor.

-----Money obtains a premium valuation over its value as a "wealth" item, like a sofa or a jug of olive oil. "Moneyness" is a shared mental state among the people using something as a money. It is not inherent in the item being used so. To the extent that something is used as money, such is the degree of the monetary premium it obtains.---------

In my post just prior to this one, I addressed some of this concept. To the ancients long ago, gold was but something you owned and traded. Yes, it trades so much better than other things it commanded your premium, especially over distance(on the road). But, as I stated in those ancient
posts, gold within the city gates often had equal or less value than any other quantity of goods. Because those people traded wealth not money. And in the case of gold, it's distance utility gave it more value, not because it was money.

The crucial factor to use in understanding a comparison between then and now is that there was no fiat or other money of any kind. Just tradable items. In today's world, your "Moneyness" mental state means "credit" shared with more "credit". All of our perceptions of money revolve around terms of payment. This is the way our "just in time" economy must function on a global scale. If gold is entered into this function, it is quickly revalued far below it's physical worth through the same credit expansion fiat demands. It loses any and all of it's wealth premium. In this process it comes into competition with official money and must be inflated as needed or it will bring down the entire credit structure.

---------The argument that the value of financial assets is imaginary is equally applicable to gold as savings. When held for its direct usefulness to the holder, the item is not a financial asset, not a money, and obtains no premium.-------

To the contrary, gold held in possession creates a demand for it's limited supply that's far higher than when it's part of an expanding credit structure. It's value tends to be in relation to the total wealth of a nation as it becomes a proportional holding that can be sold to replace lost paper wealth. This real demand for a limited physical wealth creates a value based on substance not illusion. It subjugates the wealth of financial wealth illusions and forces their discount until a real return is created from them. Business is then financed more on return and built on up front ownership. Shares can no longer run to PEs in the sky. In general, a nation's total assets become more stable.

------In short, when you claim that gold as anything other than a "true wealth asset" (of "world class" stature, no less) has the wrong valuation, I will agree. As "wealth" it is valued as an industrial commodity or a piece of costume jewelry, at the lowest bottom of the range of valuations it can have. In this view you have stood the concept of money on its head and as the dresses fall away from its legs you get to see some things you would rather not. -------------

Once again, current hard money thought assumes that gold has only a commodity value outside joining it with a credit money system. This is the concept that is on it's head and another reason all gold money systems have failed our modern task. Indeed, strip the money clothes off gold and we
will see a beautiful form. (smile)

I'll pick up later where this leaves off. Thank you ORO and everyone. I will return tomorrow.

I don't want to miss that, of course! The political discussion and arm twisting (there)is suppose to be the real reason for the dinner.

Beating a (soon to be) dead fiat. Again! @Trail Guide, ALL

------You state "Once again, current hard money thought assumes that gold has only a commodity value outside joining it with a credit money system. This is the concept that is on it's head and another reason all gold money systems have failed our modern task." -----------First a minor point:
I don't know which hard money thought you are assuming, but my hard money thought assumes only transactions denominated in gold,-----------------

--------Now the major one: Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say "all gold money systems have failed our modern task?" ---------------
They only way I'm aware any gold system TEMPORARILY failed, from your previously stated viewpoint I beleive, is that gold didn't arm itself and shoot the banksters who counterfeited it and thus apparently assumed we humans would have enough sense to do so instead.------------
Or is there some OTHER ways you feel gold has "failed" and is thus inferior as a medium of exchange to "modern fiats??" ------------------

Journeyman,

No form of gold usage in our modern money vernacular has lasted against the tide of human intervention. (Again, note the "vernacular" as the object of my thrust)The moment gold was called money, and credit was issued against it, the entire money system starts down the road of decay.

Yes, pure gold transactions were and are successful and self sustaining. That system has worked and would work again in a simple world. But then again, within that system we would not have to call it money would we???? No, we wouldn't. Perhaps wealth barter?

I would work, except that mankind's socialist needs demand that we expand any form of money thru the use of credit. Once it's "money" we seem to evolve a need to borrow and lend it? So, the ancient process of trading units of wealth, back in the good money years perhaps multiple hundreds of years ago,,,,,, really entailed the use of gold wealth barter not money credit!

To date, in modern times, every attempt to link gold to fiat credit money has failed. As stated before, I don't care who is at fault or who is more the evil player in all this. The main thrust that ORO, yourself and so many of our money masters missed in all this was that;

society could not and can not "control it's controllers" when it comes to any tyoe of credit.

Even when gold wealth is linked in some way to the money, and it is written that said link will control the system, we still corrupt it. Sure, take the process out of official hands as ORO wants? But then who is going to buy that? No one ever did in the past! Perhaps a hand full of hard money promoters would like it? But, who are we going to sell
that to, Bush, China, Russians? Who and how? What common elected body or populous will buy the hard money school of thought? What common elected body or populous would allow such a system to hold us to our debts??????

You see, it won't happen no matter the pain. The majority of people accepts that modern economic structure needs fiat credit to function and they are right in many ways. Placing gold in the mix is ok, but once again kills any chance of allowing common man a way to return to saving gold wealth as he did in the ancient times. Wealth that would match the asset savings of our world.

Again, gold systems don't TEMPORARILY fail. What fails is our perception of gold as "moneyness", as ORO uses it. This perception does not allow for the use of gold wealth buy itself, without any money system at all.

"We must have money and credit or it isn't a money we can use" the cry goes out! And so we demand the same! And the moment we use gold as money again someone will borrow some and the human credit cycle of failure goes to work on the system.

So, calling for a return of using gold as the only money again will not work for modern society. Because during the times that it did work, gold was not thought of or used in the image of money as we think of it today.

Hello everyone and ORO.

To finish up where I left off with your:
ORO (6/13/01; 03:47:52MT - usagold.com msg#: 56010)
FOA, more Fallacies - the "Western" view-------

---------- In your treck through the ancient world you had demonstrated exactly the opposite of what you seemed to think, that gold was a "wealth" no different from a jar of olive oil. Gold found its best use as a transactional medium for long distances and the intermediate range times that were inherent in trade of the time. That is why silver and other lesser metals were used for savings. But these secondary metals too obtained a monetary premium as much more of them (in terms of purchasing power) was needed for savings than for long range trade. They obtained a lesser
premium than gold had over its value as a jealosy producer on a wife's neck, but obtained a substantial one ----------

True, we demonstrated that gold was the best tradable wealth there was. But notably, the entire ancient world was, then, on a wealth barter system. As I pointed out to Journeyman today, their thought of this tradable wealth was in no way anything to our concepts of money today.

No fiat existed nor was there much banker activity. Gold wealth became so good at being used for "on the road trading" that it actually lost much of it's personal savings attributes. Common man, of that time, saved little beyond actual daily use items and gold was just too good a trade to save. In some ways, as I pointed out, evidence exists that in towns usable goods were worth more to a person's life than gold itself. So, they sent gold packing back on the road. It didn't rest long.

Further, because it was an import trade wealth that could be depended on to bring in the goods, it's value remained "on the road"during most of the early periods. It was too scarce and always being dispersed to the for winds thru ware, tear and just plain being lost,,,as it traveled along. Such is the reason so little of this ancient gold made it to this day. Our digs confirm this completely. Cutting the
estimated gold bullion reserves many think came forward on mankind's journey through life.

On the other hand, the lesser metals retained little trade premium on or off the road and became the object of saving solely for their real commodity value. A value that was and is today far less than Free Gold's would be. Workers could afford to allocate their savings into these, precisely because they were never like gold in the minds of men. Hence the reason so much silver coinage made it as it was buried in the back yards of Rome.

------------- With time and the development of banking, most of the gold needed for a long range transaction could stay in a bank vault and as one shipment arrived at the far destination, another would arrive at home port and the only amount to be settled is the small difference between the
draw on the home bank and the draw on the far away bank. Only that much gold as the difference needed to travel the distance and stay on a ship or a camel caravan. Thus gold could remain at home and be used as savings because the quantity needed in long range trade fell on a per trade
basis. Gold was priced back into savings and displaced silver and lesser metals as most international trade was transacted with bank draws rather than physical gold being transferred on each leg of a trade trip. Much more efficient.----------------

And so was born gold banking! Even prior to this time, when governments made gold a consistent "wealth barter" by standardizing it's coin weights,,,,,, the seeds were born to inflate gold by clipping and diluting it's purity. This same inflation concept was common and applied to barter of all wealth as it moved within economic trade. Even the village idiot knew to open the barrel of oil to make sure it was full before buying? (smile)

Cheating is inherent in mans dealings with each other and it was easy to later mask such evil into primary gold wealth barter as it evolved into banker control. Especially if it could hide behind the same bank storage concept your hard money teachers so admire. Bankers were quick to seize the
day as they proclaimed the concept of money in the form of gold storage receipts. Equally quick were they to mix the concept of "wealth barter" in gold with the need for credit. With little fanfare and no examination people accepted that this new bank "hard money" was only available if it came
with their concept of credit. Later our contemporary schools of hard money thought branded gold money and credit one in the same and the saviour of all the failing fiats. Truly, it was more like the saviour of finance!

In many ways, my friend, bankers, governments and power players through out time have made a silent point to never allow a return to hard money without it being entangled with credit. This is the very string they can use to attach and inflate gold before it becomes a pay as you go "wealth
barter". Your money as the ancients knew it. As you say "Much more efficient"! You bet, but for who?

---The interest rate history on gold demonstrates ---------

The remainder of your discussion can be countered in that it all records the actions of a bastardized gold plus fiat game. Rates of return, fiat money contracts and the like do not explain or negate the constant decay that sets into hard money systems. They more so only record the human costs.

I'll move on to your:

FOA - Another's letter

-----In the letter from Another the path of transition from dollar gold contract to euro denominated gold trade takes a detour from that with which we are familliar from prior posts. In prior posts the path was through a "natural" deflation of the over-leveraged gold banking system, in the way of a bank run; where physical gold is prefered to paper because the paper lacks credibility of delivery. The over-leverage was a result of: (1) Gold lending expansion induced by a false promise of liquidity by the EU central banks at absurdly low interest rates. (2) Political support from the US side allowing a supply of "infinite credit" to accomodate potential losses from paper selling by bullion banks. (3) That oil interests might bid for physical gold with the whole of their revenues rather than with a small portion of it - that portion that is intended for "savings".

At the currency end of it, the deflation of the dollar debt system of its own extreme leverage was to be met with wild dollar printing by the Fed, which would cause a hyperinflation.


In this letter, Another implies a different path that is completely unrelated and arises from actions of law through treaty and has nothing to do with the degree of leverage in the bullion markets. He seems to say that upon the joining of Britain into EMU, the dollar denominated gold contracts
traded in London would have to be converted to euro contracts, though none of the legacy currencies of the EMU are involved in the contracts. Furthermore, the letter implies that the only currency denomination allowed in new contracts within the EU would be in euro. That would force
settlement at the BIS with either the non-existent gold or with euro, that are supposed to be unavailable to the bullion banks, and that their gold denominated assets would not be recognized to back the contracts.

The precondition for this scheme is that Britain joins EMU in order to put London gold market contracts under jurisdiction of the treaties supposedly dictating this. However, Britain may not join at all considering that Britons are 70% against joining EMU at the moment (this may change, of course), and the Irish had just slammed the door for Poland by referendum, with many fearing agricultural subsidies for the Irish would be diluted by Poland's rather large agricultural sector.------------------

I would point out that all political changes are fluid. But nothing in the area of your note has changed. All through out these discussions we always allowed that a good portion of these gold contracts would be honored with actual gold ownership. Those that had the resources the world needed could demand this preferential treatment. Granted, this is a negotiating tool but even allowing for a very small portion of these contracts to settle in kind would strip most of the available bullion. Completely. This was the gold corner Another spoke of as being in place. It was and is an
official corner, if you will.

Most readers assumed he was talking about taking on the bullion banks, exchanges or whatever and tried to use his comments to leverage their bets on these very same paper markets. He called certain price levels that were specific to the game evolving onward. Without such progress, the
sudden values of bullion would have appeared. Breaking the system.

Not understanding that "for our paper gold market to burn", it's illusion price of gold would have to tumble as the Euro advanced in status. The record marks these traders loss to the paper world as most of Another's price levels will be reached and beyond. Only, it's the owners of physical that
will share in these gains.

As this unfolded, the EU banks were happy to sell their paper commitments into a known failing anglo gold market. As the prices fell, signaling the first levels of such destruction, their sold paper made money. I don't blame them as they simply sold into a fraud that was going to fail. No different than watching others take US dollars for goods produced, pre 1971, and watching that market for gold IOUs fail. The US knowingly sold these gold-less dollar IOUs in the same fashion that these EU banks are selling gold-less gold market paper to US buyers. The world goes around, my
friend.

As for all the Euro system gold that was lent at low rates, most of it went into other CBs or oil accounts. Only the local rumor mill distills these movements diferentally. In many ways this was the EUs part of their portion of the deal to maintain oil dollar settlement until the Euro was complete. Their loss of physical will be nothing compared to the gain of having their Euro become the next reserve. In addition, much of that very gold will be returned to them via the US gold stocks in Fort Knox and other places.

To repeat your above:
---- At the currency end of it, the deflation of the dollar debt system of its own extreme leverage was to be met with wild dollar printing by the Fed, which would cause a hyperinflation.-------

Absolutely. We are watching this play out as I type. However, the hyper printing and resulting price inflation was always deemed the result of our losing the reserve status. As oil prices have risen post ENU and Euro use now expands, our (USA) ability to control the game is diminished. Allan knows this and is preparing for it. Gold's bullion's eventuall shortage, a falling price for paper gold and the paper gold price illusion that dictates,,,,,, is but the signal that all is failing.

The next step was always pointed to; as at some point the anglo alliance of Britain and the US would suffer the loss of it's gold marking exchange. England has no choice, even if their public does not understand it. If they refuse to join, oil settlement will shift to Euros and demand a tiny, tiny, tiny physical gold kicker for all dollar payments. This would absolutely explode in price and freeze all
physical gold and explode the paper gold price untill it was locked down. Forcing a sudden shutdown and forced liquidation of the anglo gold system. If England does not join, this will be the result. That would set off a rush to redenominate gold loans into Euros before it's exchange rate
spikes. Besides, the euro system would be the only game in town then.

Hopefully all this will help you reevaluate the rest of your post. I'll move on to your next after dinner tonight. I'll try to post tomorrow or so.

Thank you for your discussion, it is my pleasure.

Let's begin:

Once again, to further expand the central element of my position; I'll refine further a partial from #56185 to Journeyman. And conclude with #56021. This is the central context I am addressing. It is the object of ORO's many replies. Some of which are out of this context. Randy, I'm certain you follow this well (smile).

#56185 (refined) see old post for original.

Journeyman,

No form of gold usage in our modern money vernacular has lasted against the tide of human intervention. (Again, note the "vernacular" as the object of my thrust) Even back during the moment gold was called money, credit was immediately issued against it and the entire money system started down the road of decay. That decay was in the form of inflation. Better said, the expansion of the number of original money units though some form of fraudulent actions, even in gold.

Even ORO's history teachers have no evidence of an exchange system that could last once the unit of exchange was determined to be "money". Whether it was solely gold or fiat or a combination of gold and fiat,,,,, once the ancient concept of "Wealth Barter" became "money in use" the socialist of the era made sure that money was attached to credit use.

Yes, pure gold transactions, way back then, were successful and self sustaining. That system has worked and would work again in a simple world. But then again, within that system we would not have to call it money would we???? No, we wouldn't. Perhaps, once again, wealth barter?

It would work with that name and function if used again. Except that mankind's socialist needs demand that we expand any form of money thru the use of credit. Once it's called "money" we seem to always evolve a need to borrow and lend it in an inflationary way? So you see, the ancient
process of trading units of wealth, back in the ancient good money years perhaps multiple hundreds of years ago,,,,,, really entailed the use of gold wealth barter not the credit inflation as we know money today!

To date, in modern times, every attempt to link gold to fiat credit money has failed. As stated before, I don't care who is at fault or who is more the evil player in all this. The main thrust that ORO, yourself and so many of our money masters missed in all this was that;

society could not and can not "control it's controllers" when it comes to any type of credit issuance.

Even when gold wealth is linked in some way to the money, and it is written law that said link will control the system, we still corrupt it. Sure, take the process out of official hands as ORO's school would direct? But then, who today in this modern economic machine is going to buy that? No one ever did in the past without starting the inflation presses the day after it was declared! Perhaps a hand full of hard money promoters would like this action? But, to what end would that bring us? After so many failures, who are we going to sell a controlled credit system to, Bush, China,
Russians? Who and how? What common elected body or populous will buy the hard money school of thought? What common elected body or populous would allow such a system to hold us to our debts??????

You see, it won't happen no matter the pain. The majority of people accepts that modern economic structure needs fiat credit to function and they are right in many ways. Placing gold in the mix is ok, but once again kills any chance of allowing common man a way to return to saving gold wealth as
he did in the ancient times. Wealth that would match the asset savings of our world.

Again, gold systems don't TEMPORARILY fail. What fails is our perception of gold as "moneyness", as ORO uses it. To him, his hard money school and countless millions of today's
spenders,,,,,,, money and credit creation are one in the same! This perception does not allow for the use of gold wealth buy itself,,,,,,,, in the Ancient way of "wealth Barter",,,,, without any money credit system at all.

"We must have money and credit or it isn't a money we can use" the cry goes out! And so we demand the same! Governments and Bankers don't cram down our throats what we crave? And the moment we use gold as money again someone will demand to borrow some,,,,,, and the human credit cycle of failure goes to work on the system,,,,,, once again.

So, calling for a return of using gold as the only money again will not work for modern society. Because during the times that it did work, gold was not thought of or used in the image of money as we think of it today.

==============
Now a partial of #56021 (little refined)

Through out history "hard money socialist" always fought to include gold in the currency / banking system so they had an escape rout. None of them ever could live with gold moving through society as a singular wealth asset that was traded next to cash. Making it an alternative pay as you go, non
credit, pull up your own bootstraps way to survive man's money systems. Sure, taxes would be paid on this very asset every time it was used. But, that fee is no where close to the wealth tax burdened upon the economy by an exclusive arrangement that combined gold and money. With
that entanglement in place, common people had no recourse to own a wealth that could offset the social printing press as man inflated the official gold backed money.

In hind sight we now know that the flaw in the system was in allowing gold to be entangled in the basic purpose of banking,,,,, lending. This opened the door to social engineering; in that lent gold could become a permanent fixture in the national money supply by simply printing more gold than was held.
===========

Onward!

From ORO #56016 Black Blade reposts, Euro survival:

------------ The euro is a political beast rather than an economic one. Thus its economic performance is secondary to its political performance. So long as it is not a total and utter failure, it will survive in European use, if nothing else, then because it will be required for paying taxes, sort of like tally sticks --------------- The EU isolationist concepts of taking the EU onto a single currency in order to gain independence from the dollar and of them being "self sufficient" are both wrong
economically, though they might make sense politically --------- (through the end)

Oro,
What "money" has ever been more than an political beast? To this end, money, and the credit structure it is built upon is nothing more than a social unit. Even gold's use in a physical money form has always had it's credit use subjugated to the needs of the state! Of course that's bad, but it has been no different from the beginnings of "money". Just as one of our posters here pointed out, Rome paid off the invading armies with gold. A good portion of that gold, was indeed borrowed from various subjugate states on terms of the withholding of Roman protection if it wasn't lent.
Once again, credit expansion for social good. By the way, the inflated fiat money those gold loans represented,,,,,, were never paid back!

You speak of the Euro as if it's some form of new currency no one has ever known? Yet, it's simply a basket of moneys that have been around for countless years. Some in that basket, were before the dollar? Why, even the Pound was before the Colonies? Actually, the dollar fits into every one of your counter points and does so perfectly. For 30 years, the dollar has been nothing if not a political money? You have been using it all this time whether in actual form or indirectly in it's IMF reserve status that backs most foreign currency machines today. So, here we have a fiat
currency, working for decades as nothing but fiat,,,,,,,,, being used the world over because it's just the result of a legal item as the legal tender of the US,,,,,,,,, and demands ownership to pay taxes in America also,,,,,,, and the Euro could never function in such a way?

All these years of dollar use sets a precedent that, alone, demands an equal currency function for the Euro. All of your economic sense pales in the face of such political reality. Taking all the financial laws into ACCOUNT creates no power standing that's strong enough to resist the needs of "group national identify". If nothing else, a review of all the sound economic forces that were trampled in the race to create these "United States",,,,,,, will testify to the absurdity of watching for financial precepts to lead the way to the future. Europe will join my friend,,,, therefore the "Euro IS".

================
From ORO #56016 FOA - Black Blade reposts - continued

In this post, I saw nothing that addressed the issue of gold and fiat association. The subject of my comments. All the discussion centered upon what is common in the fate of every fiat currency system. All the documented abuses and contentious comparisons of monetary rate adjustments only
further presents our reasoning; the need for gold ownership that's separate from the money system.

===========
FromORO # 56018 FOA - Black Blade reposts - continued - 2

--------- Europe also still undergoing a transition of its internal debt from dollar denomination to euro denomination. As it does so, it needs to import dollars to pay down the debts, and produce euro as contracts are re-denominated in local currency. Despite the low growth in euro monetary
aggregates, which are largely irrelevant to anything in particular, the process inevitably produces an excess of euro assets, and a shortage of dollars. -------------- Europe is also suffering from this as it exacerbates the oil problem with higher crude prices for the Saudi and North Sea Brent --------------Despite all we read from FOA on Europe's monetary discipline, its isolation and its potential deals with Arab oil and even some dealings with South America, the current reality of Europe is quite dyspeptic, and much more so on the financial side than any other. They are suffering
the inevitable outcome of their currency union which has to be inflationary, while pointing the finger of blame at the US for the inflation despite two decades of largely deflationary domestic monetary policy. In the meantime, Japan, the true international inflator, is being ignored as irrelevant and "trapped into producing for the American markets" while it actually runs a slight and falling
monetary trade surplus and a growing real goods deficit. ----------------------

Well, you have read Another's reasoning and understand my take on it. But within your posts, in general, your thrust contains a definite trust in all things dollar. Everything you have written points to an eventual reuse of dollars. Perhaps combined with an eventual return to gold backing or gold used as money itself somehow benefiting the Dollar / American. Either from the pain of US deflation or inflation, the world will somehow walk away from any attempt to use another system. Almost as if Arabia and the world respects the dollar as it is and wants more of it and our political
system?

I find this remarkable, but typical in Western Thought. This casting the entire play into distinct currency struggles aside from political goals imparts a shallow reasoning that misses the point. That is; that society groups and the non economic power structures they build create the eventual
success of their fiat moneys in the short run. Not the outright gist of how appropriate these moneys are at following the rules. Once again, the dollar's record throws down all your accounting attempts at defining proper fiat conduct.

Sure, oil costs are a current problem in EuroLand. But your words indicate it's just an economic problem that should be and is being addressed thru economic adjustments. More so in how it relates to the dollar world. No political initiatives before or after the fact? Same for the current state of Euro exchange rates? I think you will be impressed at just how much the world does not follow the terms of your script. We shall see.
=================

From ORO #56047 FOA - Re Assignat

-------- Again, a non-monetary role for gold means that it will not obtain the monetary premium valuation. It's market value would be at its lowest possible point. Lower than in today's market where much of it is held as money. ---------- If people use gold as savings (a liquid "wealth asset"
intended for exchange in another time and place), then they are using it as money. -----------

No, the Assignat is not in context because gold was considered part of the money credit universe then. In addition, their economic structure had not reached a level like today. A level that demanded a singular high speed digital fiat.

ORO, all wealth savings are in a liquid form as anything can be sold or traded. If your view of man's relationship with wealth was true, then stocks would trade for the same yield as bank CDs. Rent houses would trade for a price equal to the rent they receive,,,,, not the negative cash flow
level prevalent in so many cities. Antiques and art would become almost worthless and dollar fiat would be used for the bathroom.

Your point almost sounds like the great statesman that said gold would fall to zero is the dollar was removed from it! Ha! Ha! Remember that? I hope you do?

----- Hayek proposed this "side by side" concept long ago.-------

In no way did he propose gold be used as a wealth exchange outside the function of money! Wrong context.

---------The expectations of gold at multiple tens of thousands of dollars and gold not being used as money are mutually exclusive. -----------

Then I guess Warren Buffet's company stock should be worth about ten bucks? Indeed, there is just no way a wealth asset can rise in price if it's not tied to a currency? No class of wealth can have value unless backed by or attached to a credit expanding unit??? Who in the world would trade dollars for gold at ever higher prices if said gold cannot be inflated through credit lending????? Who would do such a thing? My goodness man? How did you come up with that
one? (smile)

------------The idea that gold is a money-substitute is ludicrous, currencies are a substitute for real money: gold, just like gold backed bank notes were (whether fully reserved or fractionally reserved), and as electronic gold is becoming. Like a bank, a currency system is never liquid, the reserves never there to cover all the liabilities, the cash never there to cover the debt. -------------

Once again, it seems you are wondering about. Where did I say my gold context was a money substitute? A good wealth asset, yes! Once again, the main component that drives the value of "wealth gold" is in the demand for it's possession. Once again, the hard money socialist bankers want to keep gold where it can be easily lent. Once again, storing gold, calling it a money system and letting mankind hold paper credits. Yes, if you own electronic gold, you will own the very same thing you hold in a modern bank account,,,,,,,, it's a credit to your name,,,,, Or by definition, it can
be nothing else than a gold contract that defines your ownership. Very much like a 1971 gold dollar! Try it, the hard money bankers will love you for it!

---------As to the Fed and the US practices past and current, I will not make the slightest excuse or justification.-----------

But sir, trying to declare that gold should be money again,,,,, denominated at a much higher dollar price,,,,,,,, only justifies the fraud by initiating it all over again? OH No! We made a mistake say the gold bankers, let's settle up everyone's loses and do it again?

No thanks.

----------While the Fed and the US monetary policy of today and of the past were motivated by an opportunity to steal and commit fraud, much of the support and the actual running of the system started out with actual belief in the absurd theories behind the justifications for the system. No such
claims can be made on behalf of the ECB and the EU.------------

Let me see,,,,,,,,, The EU wants to mark gold to the market and let it rise to it's own level as a physical wealth reserve. Holding a portion to cover the loss of their dollar reserves during the coming dollar tumble,,,,,,,,,,,,, and the Fed was just taking advantage of an "opportunity"???
Can't blame them for that? So, now the world doesn't want anybody to control gold as a credit money and ,,,,,,,,,, ?????? Oh well (smile), I'll leave this to the readers to think about.

More later

Back for more (smile)

===================
In ORO # 56052 FOA - more on the distinctions of money and government

--------In the interest of avoiding multiple transaction costs, including bid-ask ratios and transaction fees, and for the purpose of conducting economic calculation and accounting, people tend to avoid exchanges they conduct in the process of trade over time and space so that the number of transactions between the sale of one product or service and the purchase of another years down the road and in a different place - is minimized. The alternative is barter.---------

Absolutely! This is the basic reason modern economic systems use a fiat as their trading unit. Barter along with it's finite payment is no longer wanted as a trade vehicle. You see, once society has a "money" unit declared and usable, the credit expansion qualities of said fiat money is restrained by tying the "transfer of ownership" to some physical barter unit. In other words, gold only gets in the
way of man's socialist credit expansions. We did and will again manage the value of gold to allow for our credit cravings.

--------- Because fiat credit money must be managed, it must be subject to concentrated errors because the imposition of the manager's decisions as to money supply and interest rates are a single decision at any particular point in time.--------------------Whatever decision a monetary authority comes up with will be inherently wrong. What it is supposed to do is simply impossible.-----------------

Your basic position, here, is describing the flaws in a fiat managed money system. Still, just because our money managers cannot handle the job, and we hate them for our wealth destruction from their inflation,,,,,,, we so much more so crave the immediate wealth such credit illusions buy us. Again, governments, bankers and power players don't cram down the throats of their constituency a bitter pill that's not craved by the masses!

-----------Where you are right is that broadly speaking, governments want a "multilateral currency". Not because it would do any people other than government officials themselves any good, but because most organizations are mediocre or poor, they want to be free of competition
from superior performers who provide more stable financial conditions, more successful monetary policy, less taxes and regulation, courts that are faster, more predictable, just, and honest, and through these superior protection of life, liberty, property and contract. --------------(thru to the
end)------------------------

This is the ideology most hard money people take. Somehow it's as if society is in some struggle against the credit makers. When in reality, we love the wealth our nation can rob from other nations by paying them with inflated credit paper.

The points above play well and paints a beautiful picture of our struggle to overcome the evil placed on our backs. Hard money socialist can then stand behind this wall and claim themselves pure and wanting what is best for these common business travelers and plain workers. All the while they are
trying to keep the only wealth asset, man has ever won the war with, Gold, within the banking credit structure. Once again, presenting the illusion that credit wealth and it's illusion of real gains are in societies best interest. "You need hard money", they say, "but you will also want the credit inflation lent gold brings, too"!

===========================
In ORO #56164 FOA - roles of money

------------You seem to think that money can only be a paper or electronic form consisting in value entirely of its function as money. You seem to think that a pricing mechanism using money - i.e. the only effective means for trade - is forcing people to value their wealth in terms of money. ----------------------------------

No,,,,,, that is not my view. We present the position that money, in today's "vernacular" is seen in the form of a credit item. Modern people will not buy the idea of a gold that cannot be inflated. Better said, if you cannot borrow it, lend it or inflate it,,,,, it's not a money we can use.

By extension, in today's world it's almost impossible to inflate any money unit outside it's being in a paper contract form. Hence, your assumption that we view "today's money as a money that can only be in a paper or digital form".

Electronic gold, either in Central Bank function or private banking business is this same perfect vehicle. This is the very essence of the whole concept that we use to tie gold into a credit inflating system. Just as the early bankers did by; at first promising to issue singular gold storage notes instead of circulating bullion.

It didn't take long for the basic cravings of humans to demand a subtle change in the workings of that system. That is, "lend us some of those gold receipts so we can buy a better lifestyle today as we pay for it tomorrow". "If later we cannot pay for it, all of us will get the rules changed so you bullion storage guys can just print some more gold storage receipts".

Again, we as a society make the demand that drives the buy now pay later illusion. So, our demands were meat with bankers supply in the form of credit IOUs for gold that didn't exists. Both then and now!

Further, people today, never value their wealth in terms of other wealth. Such as within a "gold wealth barter" context. Western thought cannot conceive it because there is no standing wealth medium that can mark to the real market all forms of real value. Gold is and was that only wealth
asset that could do that function well. Again, as long as gold is tied into a money credit system, as the dollar reserve still tries to do,,,,,,it's value will be subjugated by the credit inflating needs of society. In this, gold cannot be saved as a "wealth asset" that measures our true worth. A worth that carries our savings from generation to generation. It will again,,,,, soon.

----------- Money is a role. It is a usage of a commodity (or an imaginary accounting unit without substance such as fiat) for trade for any or all of the following: transactions, savings, denominating contracts. As a particular item it is an instance of the concept, not the thing itself.-------------What "forces" us to use a money is our own benefit of its use. -----------------------------

Yes, indeed! In today's "moneyness", fiat is the item. As for savings, money is but one of many things we save. It just so happens that a digital fiat is poor for saving and great for trading.

-----------------------Your statement (FOAs):
"In this light, history has proven that when real wealth units are combined with our credit money, credit inflation blurs our ability to measure our worth." (#50629)---------------------------

------------ORO says This is wrong.-------------You are reading history upside down. Gold and other wealth were used successfully for ALL THE ROLES OF MONEY INCLUDING CREDIT
during the bulk of our history since the revival of trade volumes within Europe, and between Europe and the rest of the world WITHOUT inflation.---------------------------

You should reexamine your thoughts, my friend. You are the one that is trying to sell us a definition of "inflation" as being in price function only! If one does not see the monetary inflation in past history as real inflation, then all perspective is lost.

All gold systems were given over to monetary "inflation" just as soon as "credit" was issued against the system. In some cases the discipline of gold was used to deflate the over extension of credit then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, but, by far and wide,,,, the money was inflated until it either crashed the banking system through deflation (failure) or it created price rises that further destroyed the system's gold
backing comparisons (credibility). Especially as the gold values were fixed against the supposedly fixed currency units. It all failed to work and in the process deceived savers to hold wealth values that were in illusion. (in today's world stocks are a good example) Instead of real gold!

------------------You say (FOAs):
"To say that markets function best when free to shift denomination power between fiat and gold ignores the fact that when combined there can be no shifting. Further, credit money has always been in a process of credit inflation decay and can hardly be seen as "functioning best"!" ---------

------I(ORO)agree.------ The best system does not have fiat credit money at all.-----------------------

I agree also, ORO! But, who in this era is going to return to the singular "Wealth Barter" as gold's use back then represented. It wasn't money then, it was a fiat free world with the real wealth of gold being traded along side all other items. If we lived then we would not call it money. Certainly not credit money! Without this distinction, modern hard money thought is doomed to strive for another go at a process that society will not let work. The loss is for all of us.

==========================================
From ORO #56171 FOA - comments to your recent post, part 1

-----------FOA says: ORO, it's important to understand that most of what the "West" is built on is financial debt without human assets. Only people can create wealth with energy, thought and movement. WITHOUT A POPULOUS STANDING BEHIND OUR HUGE AMERICAN DEBT, IT'S PAYMENT REVERTS BACK TO INCREASING THE BOOKKEEPING VALUE OF ALL TANGIBLE WEALTH THROUGH FIAT INFLATION. ---------------

---------ORO says: Here you have hit on the problem. There is not "populous" standing behind debt. It is not a collective. The debt is not collective, and its repayment is not a collective responsibility. "We" are participants, not a single unit. Each of us has his own obligations and assets. They are individually owned and owed. The collective view is an Eastern, and a Central European idea born of too short a time between tribe and state. ---------------------

Well,,,,,,, let's see. The thrust of my above comment was to point out that there is no "populous" standing behind the American debt. I meant the American debt in it's entirety and made no distinction between public or private debt. The fate of our dollar (or any fiat currency) is directly tied to the ability of us Americans to service this debt. In total! Truly, it makes little difference to the viability of the system if 10% of the people can pay their way while leaving the other 90% to fail their responsibilities and crash the system, does it?

The nature of every money system it to become extended in timeline as it's logical socialist use comes to an inflated end. On this I do not waver and see the Euro as timely to replace the dollar fiat. Still, the credibility of any fiat system, this dollar also, is maintained right to the end by the "total" ability of the "populous" to cover all the debt. The real problem you have failed to hit on is in the inability of the "participant", not the "collective" to have a wealth item that transcends the debt inflation every fiat produces,,,,, and it's wealth illusion. Gold outside the banking / money system does just that. However, it will not be available on a mass scale before most of our Western wealth illusion is destroyed. Something the ECB hopes to change for their better future.

Truly, the Western idea of money today is that big government, that is all of us, can save the system. No where do we see evidence that the US is operating within the "participant" working order you introduce here??? This may be your hard money school's goal, but it is not the reality of our US life styles. In the US our mentality is all business with a "I'm gona get mine and to heck with
the system" attitude! This will not be good for the children as it all unfolds,,,, believe it!

Where as the "Eastern" or "Old World" views see each person maintaining their own way so as not to hurt society's ability to function economically. This entails a responsible savings level that is of quality, enduring wealth. Not just the Western idea of some financial money wealth. Certainly this drive is behind the need to withdraw from the dollar and re introduce gold savings to common people.

--------------------------FOA says:
All this debt we created brought us a lifestyle that is an illusion built on the backs of those that brought that debt. They traded real efforts to enhance our position and no will receive inflated assets that reflect said inflation. Even the gold at West Point will be inflated to match some of that debt. Truly, the expenditure of so much of the worlds productive efforts on producing our Western Way,,,,, cannot be in any way less than "decline and stagnation" before the fact. Yes, it is indeed our view of money that created this fraud and the whole world will pay something to end it.

ORO says:
The debt did not buy us anything that would not have been there. If it did, credit expansion would be practiced widely and everywhere, and everyone would be astoundingly rich. What has gotten us where we are since 1980, and particularly since 1987, is a RELATIVELY contractionary monetary policy within the US, which has forced dollar debtors outside the US to export their goods into the US in order to obtain dollars that are swallowed into erasing their debts – which also erase the dollars and make them that much scarcer. Where the dollar system was inflated was from outside the US. ---------------------------------------

Sir, you say "The debt did not buy us anything that would not have been there."? This begs the point; "without debt our productive jobs could not have afforded to buy the wealth"! Our lifestyle is, indeed, robbed from others in a world that cannot print debt behind a reserve currency illusion.

Think about that before you expand this fraud of a theory too far. All of your statistics are rendered useless as fact when based on value assumptions denominated in dollar fiat today.

===============================
From ORO #56182 FOA - comments part 2

--------- Most of all, I find it odd that you reflexively associate with fiat credit money the natural function of gold in all monetary roles that provide it with a value beyond that which comes from the demand for its use as jewelry and as the best electrical contact enhancer. For some reason you drop the fact that modern finance developed before fiats were (semi) successfully floated – with
credit contracts, transaction clearing, futures contracts, merchant and investment banking, bonds, etc. with church and state screaming bloody murder with every new development. --------------------------------------------

My friend, gold has no "natural function in a monetary role". It was a wealth barter item and nothing more. Your school seems to distance itself from that fact. Is it because banking is doomed to a lesser profit level if gold is allowed to mark the credit cycle. By valuing every extension of credit to it's true level all bank performance would be a "real" pittance!

Once again this school of thought tries to follow the notion that the function of "credit money" is what gives gold it's "wealth barter" value. A notion shot down every time a credit fiat claims that gold is worthless if not tied to it's money paper. In 1971 the US said the same thing; " gold will go to zero once the dollar is removed". Tell me, were you around then,,,, do you remember that address? I bet MK does? (smile)

-------------FOA says:
Our dollar would have worked very well within this framework if we had only allowed gold to run outside the money system. Priced as wealth not credit money. But, then again, such a setup would not have brought The American Experience others envy so much. A constricted money supply and low dollar exchange rates would have measured our profligate ways quickly and driven us into the very decline and stagnation you mentioned above. A fitting judgment for a nation that would not pay it's own way.

ORO says:
Let me restate that as the opposite, which I am convinced is the truth: Our full gold money system would have worked very well within this framework if we had only kept gold as the core of our money system. Priced as money rather than "wealth".------------------------------------------

Tell me ORO, exactly how does a nation keep gold as the core of it's money system while printing currency far and beyond the fixed gold to currency rate? Every "money credit system" has done exactly this no matter the law. In this perfect system you advocate, it is "wealth", in the form of gold
that is managed so as not to reflect man's savings.

We could drop the dollar and return to your gold banking system tomorrow. Place all the rules and laws in force that you require and,,,,,,, once again,,,,,, the societies cravings for more credit would cause us to move the bar a little higher. Print just a little more and to hell with gold value. This is the world order you direct all gold advocates to seek,,,,,, this is the failure of hard money to the benefit of power bankers you so despise.

The rest of your post attempts to place the blame for America's debt inflation upon others. Look in a mirror and see the enemy,,,,,, it is there for the view.

===========================

From ORO #56200 megatron - only once

---------The proximity of the behavior to that of the end of the Federal reserve's version of the gold standard (through to 1929) is a distinct indication that a gold standard of some sort is in operation (someone is providing the markets with gold at a previously set contracted price - a par).--------

It seems that every possible angle will be used to explain why the dollar is failing and gold use is not the problem. Every angle except the fact that this dollar is on it's last legs.

===========
From ORO #56204 Cavan Man - because there is a way out

--------Despite FOA's protestations to the contrary, the period of the past century is rather unique, and has no effective precedents in history. That it happened once is the only reason we have to believe it could happen again. ------------------------

This has to be the narrow direction your view takes. Because once gold is seen in it's ancient use as a "wealth barter",,,, outside our modern credit money definition,,,,,,,,, the entire argument for us to return to a gold money system is voided. Once that ancient perception is understood, anyone can see that gold used as money has always fallen into a credit inflation that eventually destroys gold's value as savings for common man.

The logic of our thrust is clear to anyone that stands aside these faulty hard money concepts. The failures of this same is the reason for our thrust to a new gold market. Free Gold as the ancients knew it. Free Gold as the wealth of nations. Free Gold that blocks the bankers from their constant goal. A goal that replaces the wealth we produce and save with an illusion that credit money can buy us the world.

No more! No more we cry!

I'll now try to reply to several posters and eventually detail the logic so many cannot see.

Thanks

Britain to buy 25 'Euro army' transport planes!
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html
Almost sounds like some kind of a "United States Of Europe", doesn't it? And with each day passing England just keeps moving further into this economic group. Today they are part of the EU (European Union) tomorrow part of the EMU (European ""Fiat Money"" Union)(big smile)

Some replies on the Trail, later today

-------------------------
Ministers from EU countries are to commit themselves to buying more than 200 military transport aircraft which will be used by the "Euro army".

Britain will pledge to buy 25 of the Airbus A400M planes and
Ministry of Defence sources say the project will secure the future of around 8,000 British jobs, mostly in Bristol and Derby.

Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon will sign a "memorandum of understanding" at the Paris Air Show this afternoon to commit Britain to the deal.

Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Turkey are also signing up to the agreement which means a total of 212 aircraft will be ordered. ----------------

Time for a rest!

Hello ALL!

We are a little bushed from all the recent path clearing, here on the Gold Trail. So, rather than walk the trail today, I want to just speak a little about some various things that may interest some. Let's rest here on the porch and consider:

Of Credibility
A long time ago a gentleman told me; "go ahead, use your mind, speak for me as I give to you. Tell them our thoughts, it be good for all to know these things". With that comment, it all started. Even further back, long before we had these internet forums the logic and efforts behind this push was flowing..

Presently, I write almost entirely for myself. Another shares with me when and if as he sees fit. Often, to my consternation, and some embarrassment, his Thoughts do not arrive for copy when I say they will. Truly, this is as it should be.

I (we) expect none of you to consider anything said here as credible. Everything is given as I understand it. If you came with a notion that I am someone who sees the future; grab the children and run far away. For these Thoughts, and my ongoing commentary, are meant to impact exactly as the "gentleman" said they would. People hear them, and whether believed or not, the words leave a mark. A mental mark on the trail, if you will. And later, after the world turns, our little "stacks of rocks" will be easier to understand next time you are passing this way. In fact, your ability to find your own way will forever be enhanced for having seen this path in a different light.

Of Myself
I seek nothing and am paid nothing for this effort. CPM allows my discussion for their clients consideration and perhaps entertainment. It is not given as fact. To this end I offer this as Another has done; so these works are as free as the wind. My word is to remain, here only, until finished or as long as MK will accept me. That is all that binds my hand.

I have an old world kind of logic that requires me to stand upon or feel anything I invest my wealth in. And indeed, my wealth is partially what I know and speak. So to that end, I myself, some long time ago, have stood within the door of CPM's office! Just to look around. I spoke only to the woman at the front desk and was known to no one. By my word, this was my only contact with this fine company.
===========

Now back to the task at hand: some comments and replies.

Instead of writing to every person that has commented to me on USAGOLD Forum over this last few days, I'll just reference a few and their
---- good words ----
and reply further myself.

======
------ "Thanks for working so hard for us, as always" ----
Thank you, Mr GRESHAM (smile)
=========
------ "Can ya imagine the parallel to UAW autoworkers in the 80's who were smashing foreign cars?? How about out of work financiers rallying in downtown Flint against those "Euro lovin' traitors" who own gold just to undermine the great USA?? I'm beginning to wonder if finding some cozy place in Europe might be a wise move someday." ------------
Ha! Ha! DRAGONFLY, don't be too hard on humankind! If you decide to go to Europe, keep a place here also. We are not so bad, just like most of our extended families,,,,,, hate some and love the others! (grin)
=========
------- "And not to forget MK's latest essay - it's a-(u)wesome." --------
COBRA(too), don't ever make the mistake of debating MK! I can see his mind and those letters stand for "Money Knowledge"! (smile)
==========
--------- "Dollar use has expanded in the world over for almost 30 years without being tied to gold, therefore Euro use should do the same. Dollar used the idea of forced liquidation of contracts in 1971, therefore EU should the same in 2002.---------------
GE, just follow your own trail, sir. It will connect to ours soon enough. See you there.
=============
---------Professor von Braun's latest update at The Rocket School of Economics,,, Excerpt from "Lecture 38"-----
Hi there, RANDY at the TOWER! Your input did not go without thought. The professor is real sharp and understands political power. Just look at how Placer Dome has just been forced to formally relinquished it's holdings in a major south american property. Between Bre-X and government grabs?????? what a place for us to put our wealth?

Further,
People forget to consider that taxing power is greater than takeover power for governments. When gold was money in the US, it didn't generate much tax revenue on it's sale. So, they grabbed the cash that at that time was in the form of gold. They didn't make any friends, but you have to admit it was a smart move.

But now it would most likely be reversed. Especially if the wealth reserve (gold) most world nations hold (the US will have a lot less a little later) becomes better taxable as the result of rising prices. In other words, there is no way governments today will grab gold if they can tax it's trade and production at far higher rates to gain fiat bookkeeping income. This avenue is part of what is behind the Free Gold drive that so few can see.

ORO rightly argues that high official taxes are what drive away all economic business endeavors and kills the tax paying goose. However, if the world's greatest wealth asset (gold) can be put in such demand that it's price starts a long steady climb,,,,,, without it competing with fiat money,,,,,, the mines will stay in production even if production is taxed to death and controlled by a new "Texas Railroad Commission". (Thanks Randy #56039!) Let's see, years from now, a mine produces gold at a gross dollar cost of $1,300 and ounce,,,,,, then sells for $27,225 an ounce,,,,,, the government taxes $23,000 an ounce,,,,,, Yup! they will make some good profit on the amount of allocated production they can do.

Just like oil today,,,,,,,, Free Gold is a good deal for tax income. And most gold industry workers will stay in their jobs (although some layoffs will happen) even though it's a dirty, almost break even deal for mine owners. Their business would only get a fraction of the profits from a huge rise in gold bullion and their shares would wallow in uncertainty as gold soars. But, then again, didn't your buddy Will Rogers say something about American risk takers,,,,like:

"staying out of the governments path with your investments is the second national pass time behind baseball"

Ho! Ho! That Will was something!

So, the future may just be a great deal for bullion owners as gold rises! Yes? Even old Aristotle would not have to sell and pay taxes,,,,,, at least until he wanted to sell to buy a better lifestyle. Yes, this is the reason that gold production is today and will be later such a bad investment.
Compared to bullion and rare coins, that is! *[With their regular capital gains tax rates.] *(Ed. note: appended according to following post)
============================
---------------- "CALL ME SIMPLE, CALL ME WHAT EVER...... BUT THAT BAGS IT FOR ME" ---------------------
OK, BUENA FE! You are on the team,,,,,, onward! (smile)
=============
------ "I do not understand FOA's statement that because the ECB decrees it, gold will not be anywhere, lent or borrowed. Seems to me that what I do with my gold is outside any jurisdiction of the ECB, and the same is true of many others" ---------------
Actually GOLDFAN, your feelings were easily comparable to those of drinkers during our American prohibition. Alcohol was against the law but people did it anyway. In many ways people's actions are the free market that is so powerful against government laws. During the war, everything from cigarettes to rubber was rationed and outlawed from typical use. Still, the market often overcame the law. Heck, even today, drugs and any number of other illegal activities are done as the law has little ability to stop the same.

But that's not the kind of law what this vision of a Free Gold market will depend on. These examples above outline rules and laws that restrict actions. For any wealth law to have an effect, it would have to be a known official protocol on the recourse side of disputed claims. Almost like how the dollar Legal Tender is a law in the US and mostly a protocol in the rest of the world. It regulates how you settle currency debts everywhere but has no real jurisdiction overseas. Except through IMF agreements.

On gold settlement, the comex did as much when it changed it's rules on silver during the 1980 hunt fiasco. By stopping the hunts from settling their futures contracts in physical silver, they stopped real people from dealing silver thru contract. At least on that exchange.

I don't expect the EBES (Euro Bullion Exchange System or whatever type name they use) to act exactly, but in the same spirit. No one is going to tell anyone they cannot enter into gold contracts. Sure, we will be able to borrow, lend, option or sell gold all we want. But, unlike those overt alcohol laws during prohibition, today's gold party people be able to drink all they want. (smile) That is deal in all the gold collateral you want. But, if any of those deals go bad because the other side wants to walk, instead of deliver, you will have to settle in cash. In a Euro court of law, no one could bind you to physical settlement if the deal was in Euro Legal Tender. Even if it was in the contract. You would have to accept cash, if contested.

Now, some say this will simply drive all gold deals outside Europe. That's thinking in the present context. But in the future the dollar reserve and it's credit gold market will be in a shambles with people running all over the globe just looking for a place to deal gold at all. Credit gold will be a joke by then as trillions of losses will be outstanding.

The effect of all this would be to drive most every portion of physical gold dealings into "on the spot" buying and selling. Mostly in Euros. A mine could still borrow, using the value of gold as collateral, but it would only be the "cash value" of that gold that could be used in settlement (if the deal went to court). OR physical settlement if both sides had no problem (and stayed out of court).

This kind of legal protocol change, not unlike changing comex rules of trade, only affects the financial side of gold and in no way restricts investors from cash spot dealing in physical gold. Again, it would force the world gold markets to adjust away from copying the old dollar markets that so manipulated the physical gold price in the first place. Of course, no one would be trying to deal gold in dollars then anyway.

In reality, very little physical gold would be borrowed, either ahead of production or from world stores to sell into the spot market. If one owned gold and wanted to liquidate to buy something, you would sell it, pay taxes and use your dollars ,,,, errrr Euros! Gold would, over time, rise to reflect it's real reserve value to both central banks and private owners the world over.

OIL, governments, corporations and families would once again all be buying real gold for the historic wealth value such a metal imparted to a portion of their total asset savings. The demand for gold would once again be generated for it's main "historic utility";

"a wealth no social group could inflate thru monetary credit use"

Gold would would then become a moving tradable asset that tended to value currencies in parallel. A wealth without a country or sponsor. If one preferred to see as MK might, as a money without a country, that's good too!

The effect would be the same. The physical price on gold would respond to the ebb and flow of a rare metal no different than the ebb and flow of currencies today. As the always present inflation tax took away from fiat, as it has done from the beginnings of time,,,,, so too would the various gains taxes take from gold as it was traded for cash to buy things. There would be no monopoly of either over the other. The wealth utility of gold would be matched by the necessity utility of digital money. Fiat would be inflated at "whatever rate" as it stayed in settlement use. Investments would be made and lost, no different than today in our largely "ungold" fiat money world. Only for gold, then, it would be purchased for it's longer term ownership by both official and private interest.

If there is one redeeming consideration here,,,, it is that gold, separate from all money issues, would rise to reflect all the wealth inherent in the world. Just as it's value did in ancient times. But remember, when trying to compare values back then, that bottle of olive oil was worth so much more to life than an equal item is today. However, our modern world has a 1,000,000 times the total wealth as existed back then. Truly, gold has a long journey of price appreciation before it even begins to slow. Our children will not see it's full value reached.

Will such a transition be stopped? Not if it benefits the purpose of everyone and this certainly will. Is it the best? No, I think ORO's directions are the best, but the world has proven we will never live with it. Much less even try to return to it. War "times 2" will not bring us to gold money again. Besides, we live in today and tomorrow, not the past and we have changed our economic dynamics far too much for gold to ever be used as credit money again. Yes, the dollar will fail and it's whole economic system will slowly (or quickly) fall away. But, we are an energetic lot and have already planned the next replacement.

So onward we hike to see how the path turns.
===========

OK, enough for now. (smile) I want to thank everyone that read, commented or considered these thoughts. Both here and on the main forum as well as OROs great works. I'll reply more to other's posts when I return in a few days. Perhaps then Journeyman and I can go out for some burgers and beer on the USAGOLD Forum,,,,,, while we talk about our differences on gold (smile).

ECB's Duisenberg says likely to step down before term ends!
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html

The above is from the USAGOLD news feed. All the readers here can access this area anytime.


This item of news only confirms part of Another's letter. Duisenberg was the point man in engineering the initial insertion of Euros into use. A delicate action that required the exchange rates we saw during this period. We are now leaving this period and with the 2001 distribution of actual
notes, the Euro will be ready to advance. This era will require a different character in their ECB position of leadership.

-----Wim Duisenberg on Wednesday broke silence over his tenure as president of the European Central Bank, saying he was unlikely to serve out his term but did not elaborate.-------------

-------Mr Duisenberg is said to have agreed at the start of his appointment in1998, under pressure from French officials, to only serve half of his eight-year term before stepping down in favour of a French candidate. ----------------

Dithering over euro will harm London, says Mayor
http://www.usagold.com/DailyQuotes.html

ALL,

Once again, our point through out all this discussion is the impact on the current gold market and it's pricing / values further down the road. One small portion of this ongoing currency / power transition is seen in our position that;

*** in following the eventual certainty of British entry into EMU (Euro use), that their entry will be part of that dismantling of the Anglo gold pricing structure.***

Once again, our reasoning in pointing to this political movement is for the readers to follow the trail and see it's purpose in Another light. We point out the "reality" of what "is" happening in a way that allows readers to understand it as these news "events" mark the path. We do not so much wish to promote what "is" happening, rather build the readers ability to grasp why certain people are making this happen. In building that ability, I often present why I (as an American) have structured my wealth to make ready for this change.

It is not my position to endorse what "should" be done in order to build a better world. I do offer a rebuttal as to why past "economic" reasoning is being side tracked to travel this different path. In doing this I do "discount" the logic many Western hard money advocates use. I do this to show the "why", not the morality of it all.



---------- Ken Livingstone has warned Tony Blair to stop "dithering" and campaign for Britain's entry into the euro. In a damning attack, the Mayor accused the Government of squandering the opportunity to make progress on the euro afforded by its election landslide.

Despite Blair's attempts to keep the issue on the back burner, the Mayor will spearhead a vigorous campaign to warn of the damage which could be inflicted upon London if the Government remains outside the eurozone. -------

FOA - rough words I have quite a few comments I prepared, but am refraining from doing so because they would present both of us in a negative light since they are rather nasty in conclusions, argumentation, and manner. They will come off as a personal attack, which perhaps they would be.
I tried to tone things down and dress them more nicely, but that did not "do the job". Therefore, I will refrain from posting these comments until you agree to be exposed to these rough words and criticisms.

Sir,
There is no possible reason for our discussion to include personal attacks. In all my replies and rebuttals I tried to attack your position,,,,,, not your personal character or personal reasoning for taking that position! If you (or I) have certain political thinking that is helping to present the case, good! But, their involvement does not prove the workability or validity of said position.

Through out the political world it is a common, lesser man that must resort to attacking his opponents "agenda" instead of his opponents "position". Often, when a person runs out of fuel (thoughts)or is being corrnered,,, they must "sink" to build some perceived "political agenda" as the object of their thrust to discredit their opponent. Such reasoning is thin, shallow and as such is seen through by others. This does nothing for the audience, nor does it give them anything logical to ponder as they still are left with no logic as to "why" to reject the actual "position".

If I have presented your concepts in a way that you did not offer them,,,,,,, then take those items one at a time and refute my take on it. Remember, I do (and will) refute your position as I or others may perceive it. Not necessarily as you wanted me or others to understand it. If that is not how you wanted those views seen,,,,, then dissect them and explain so we may proceed. In the interest of the audience, take it one item at a time.

Further along,

I once was on stage before a gathering as we were trying to debate a topic. My opponent had lead off and was killing me! (smile) Indeed, I am far better at speaking than writing,,, so his ability in real life was something to behold. He did such a good job that I went blank and was about to go off in a foolish mud tossing direction.

Then, watching the faces of everyone,,,,, as they were waiting for something real to chew on,,,,, I realized that it was what "they were thinking that counted" not mine or his personal feelings on the subject. I started off by telling the group that I agreed with everything he said. Ha! Ha! Then, item by item, I listed his points. After each point, I would then suddenly remember why I disagree and told the people that I was the one that was "incorrect" for agreeing with such nonsense,,,,,,, and explained
why.

Ho! Ho! I won the tide of opinion! (smile)

So, ORO,,,,,,,,, one must strive to gain the tide in this political world if the game itself is to be won,,,,,,,, not just the first quarter of a mud match.

British entry into EU - NO WAY! Trail Guide with due respect sir, I do not believe Britain will ever join the EU. There is incredible opposition to such a plan from its people. Remember they speak English and are not European!--------

Well ausome,
I'm not sure I grasp your point? You see, the last time I heard the British talk,,,, they didn't speak english either!! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! (huge smile) Just a good joke!

I have a really good friend from Ireland. Every time she visits us that woman can go off on the very best rendition of "down home" British you ever heard!! I told here once that more Europeans speak better english than the British ever have and she agreed. Now,,,,, I'm not even going to mention the communication mode those Irish have,,,, Eh Cavan Man? (smile)

Seriously,,,, if one does their history work on Great B ,,,,,, that Island has been trading with Europe far longer than with America. The language has never been a point of ideology or social contention. In many ways, the recent building of the Chunnel (Channel Tunnel) only strengthened their physical ties with the continent.

I pointed out in another post that they won't join because they want to,,, they will do it after fully understanding the economic implications if they don't. Later, they will hurry to join,,,, before the fact.


---------Nonetheless I agree there will be a dismantling of the Anglo gold pricing structure but this has been set down already in the WA regardless of whether Britain joins or not. --------


Well sir, as our Cavan Man pointed out earlier today, London is a big chunk of the world's financial game. It has also evolved into the only remaining major support for the dollar's rule. They have used that position for some time to slant much of world finance into dollar holdings. Gold was but one tool in that chest.

This whole EuroLand shift has, all along, included a plan by European leaders to bring England (that's London too(smile)) into that fold. All for the purpose of breaking the last dollar post.

In a further light, few can grasp just how much oil wealth is centered in London. That wealth is also geared to making the Euro project a success and does exert an enormous influence on opinion there.

Once the tide turns, and England is seen as slanted to EMU, no matter if it's years away,,,,,, watch the whole gold market sector fail it's ability to put a price on real bullion trading! When that part of the dollar game is lost ,,,,,, when that post of dollar support is gone,,,,,, the washout Another has always pointed to will start.

Britain and the Euro: Opinion is divided, but many consider it inevitable----

Yes, it's true that most people over there think it's inevitable. I don't know if it's from a good understanding of the dollar's problems or from plain old common sense,,,, but many can see the end of our dollar's timeline.

Certainly, neither the pound or Britain's economic structure can stand alone in this new era of world trading. Then must join with someone. Quite a few thinkers over there see the fix our fed is in now and also understand just what Allan's game plan must lead to. With the Euro now in full
"Rut Season"
the dollar must stay strong or be completely dropped. In order to keep the greenback strong we must play the game of "see everybody,, we are dropping rates to gun our American financial structure"! The message that sends also includes;

A. to hell with long term stability of the currency

B. to heck with the eventual super inflationary downturn such an act will bring

C. who cares about the industrial backbone of the American nation if our exchange rates render it profit less. Just as long as our financial sector (stock market included) attracts dollar flow.

Even Bush is forced to backtrack on the Steel issue. This and any number of other recent political reversal rumblings smell to heaven like the socialist beast dollar supporters tag Europe as. This begs the question; if the US really turns down, will we suddenly shut our long proclaimed free trade doors? Blocking a return of our trade deficit dollars? The answer foreign reserve dollar holders say is,,,,,,,yes! At some point they must realign into another trading block?

You see, with the Euro standing in the wings,,,, the ECB has but to wait out our final inflationary act. Allan is blocked from any other recourse by the very existence of the Euro. (note: I have spelled Mr. G's name with two LLs for so long I see no reason to change now. (smile)

Behind the Barrick/Homestake Merger: A Shotgun Wedding Based onGold and Dollar Fundamentals------

In my view, you are absolutely right; "Barrick is covering their shorts with HM". We can also see this in a deeper view.

ABX has evolved into little more than a banker's extension. One that trades gold for their gain. On ABXs side,,,,, I see their massive paper short position as a financial tool that allows them to make a return on in place reserves without mining them in total,,, at once. That is all their program is really doing. It's a product of banker's games.

The greatest risk for them could be that a good portion of their dealings may not have involved CB gold sold short,,,, and they didn't know this for a long time. The other side of those trades were real cash buyers that simply wanted to work their money in government debt while waiting for the mine to produce gold. The buyers were willing to do this because an outright buy would have gunned the market. In addition, their cash would have not earned a return while waiting for the Euro to free gold. So, some of their smaller, non official buying was channeled into mine paper while hiding behind the big BBs.

Ha! Ha! It's kind of a joke when one thinks about it. The mine was leveraging their unmined assets to produce a simple return and telling their investors it got a higher realized price for gold production (and it was) ,,,,,,,,, while locking out any chance for profit if gold ran.

The opposite side brought the future gold assets of the mine at cheap prices and paid the mines investors that same little simple return to gain all the future profit. Future profit, I might add, that would make those little ABX gains look tiny!

Now, some smart cookies are putting the puzzle together,,,, so, they must get some uncommitted gold at any price so as to cover those real players that were suddenly found to be there,,,,, on the other side.

This is the dilemma most gold mine investors face. Some brought HM years ago at $8++ and were waiting for gold to rise. Now, with the game coming to an end, their assets are taken below par and become paper support if the physical market locks up. The combined companies would never
keep up with physical in that run.

Further,

Yes, the market is in a changing mode (just as you say) as the countdown begins. Players are more and more understanding the true dynamics that will mark ""all"" paper gold assets down once this runs. Physical will be the only game in town then!(smile)

Hello Leigh, Tree in the Forest,

GoldFields (gold) be taken out like HM?

I don't think so. However, to place my view in context; I own some goldfields as a small percentage of total physical gold wealth. I also own it with little consideration of it's trading value now. If the shares went to $100 or $.10 I would not consider selling it. They remain a lifetime
holding,,,,, (burned for my duration).

The logic in my allocation is to gain the eventual value it would carry after physical gold has been revalued by market forces. A free market, outside and unattached to the banking, money, credit world. That would take the metal far beyond anything we consider normal,,,,, and keep it there for decades. After South African places considerable new taxes on this gain, Goldfield's operation would still turn out a very good long term dividend over the life of it's reserves. But nothing close to the projections many gold Bugs would place on these shares if they thought such prices could materialize.

My reasoning employs a return on this risk that is unacceptable to most,,,,, if they understood the dynamics of the process. You see, those shares may not show any market value in the heat of our paper gold market being torn apart. Indeed, they may not trade for a year or so. Only to trade
once again after physical gold trading is fully reestablished at a hugely higher level. You see, there
may not be a point to cheaply reenter after the fact. This is the main reason why I picked a company so richly endowed.

On this political ground I base my reasoning. South Africa will not allow GoldField's production to be taken over to support the bankers behind Anglo (or any other). If Anglo (like barrick) is forced to deliver $10,000++ / oz gold into a $300+ hedge book, they would mostly fail and pay little
taxes. Considering that inflation, in general will force production cost above $1,000/oz, the clean gold reserves of GoldField makes it a political keepsake. The only owners that will benefit from the mine share game are the ones that can own the company thru thick and thin,,,,, and even then own it solely for the dividends it will produce. Such is the "New Gold Market Dynamics" we face.

Still, for one with understanding, the most risk free and most profitable wealth to own today is pure bullion or coins. Rare and near rare coins will seldom trade in the future and if they do at all at a tremendous premium.

We shall see (smile)

Big Scoop!

ALL,

I had (and have) a number of things to cover today but this article in the WSJ needs attention more than anything. Please get a copy and read "Our Economy Needs a Golden Anchor" by Jack Kemp. Read the whole thing, right to the end. The subtle expressions clearly hint that someone "up
there" has read the "Euro vision" on gold and how it will impact the Euro Project! Not to mention the dollar.

MK, Randy, be sure to note the shift to a "Free Gold" anchor as expressed in:

"There is nothing mysterious about how gold would be used as a reference point or how a NEW MONEY STANDARD FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM would work."

and

""With the dollar defined in TERMS of gold and with American citizens FREE to buy and sell gold at will"

(note: he said terms,,,, as in gold's value,,,,,, as in gold's market price,,,,,, as in not fixed to gold!!)

and

""the fed would forget about raising or lowering interest rates --------- Markets would determine interest rates"

and

"There would be no need for the government to maintain a large stock of gold ---------- people would be FREE to do so on their own in the marketplace"

(note: opening the door for a transition of US gold to cover past dollar expansion)

and

"I believe Britain would soon follow to make the pound as good as gold and AVOID HAVING TO ADOPT A SINKING EURO"

(NOTE: It's almost as if we are trying to stop England from joining the EMU by adopting some of the evolving EMU qualities! Currency war in progress!)

-------------

Ha! Ha!
Can any Western Hard Money Advocate imagine such a system (smile)???
Taking gold out of official price fixing hands and allowing it to trade FREE next to the currency!!

Boy,,,oh,,,,Boy!
After this trial balloon the next step would be in trying to fully copy the whole project.
The only trouble is that if we try this,,,, and don't dismantle our anglo gold market's connection to "paper credits in gold",,,,,,, the Euro free market in physical would fully rob all the US government's bullion.

And most of it's private bullion. Mostly by using dollar reserves outside the USA to buy it.

The upshot would be a "bullion-less" paper dollar gold market and a surging dollar price for physical. Who in the world could have seen something like this comming?

You would almost think someone(s) was thinking about all of this (smile)

(Robert, we are almost there!)

Hello all,

The sun begins to rise!

Reading Michael's Commentary & Review, posted today at:
------USAGOLD (06/28/01; 09:01:37MT - usagold.com msg#: 57063)
On Kemp, van Eck, and Dogs Who Know When a Storm Is Approaching-----
I seems some thinkers are seeing what is happening now along with the implications this will have on our economic structure. MK is right, Mr. Kemp is coming around. So too must any one that considers the big picture. Truly, our Randy is not the only person that is tabulating this incredible pace of money creation.

Today, US money authorities are caught in a trap that can only lead to a real inflation. Not the little 10% to 20% runs so many were frightened by in the past. Rather a price inflation spiral that marks the closing era of our dominant currency system,,,,, the dollar reserve.

After all these years of expanding our debts, our business and our leverage in this economy, there now comes a time when it will expand no more. This is such a time. Once pushed over this hill, our economic train ride takes on a different feel. Official strategy, policy and thrust is all at once changed to maintaining the system's function with little regard to long term economic results. Money quality is abandoned for just some measure of continued money demand. All eyes are trained on maintaining financial asset values with little regards to saving the main economic structure's profitability, such as in the manufacturing sector.

Rates are lowered time and time again as money substitutes expand at ever higher rates. Suddenly there is now no room for a fed induced business slowdown. Because such a change would not just slow the economy, as in the past,,,,,, it would wreck the actual currency structure.

We have but to notice the reverse reaction present in today's exchange rates, compared to years gone by. All at once, the currency must have inflationary policy to keep the exchange rate up. Where in the past such a lowering of interest rates along with a money expanding drive would have driven the dollar down. With this understanding alone, we can know our system is over the hill,,,,,, past the end of our currency timeline,,,,,, heading down into the final inflation.

As long as the Euro can stay behind the dollar on exchange rates,,,,, our trade deficit must grow,,,, our internal manufacturing sector must weaken,,,,, and our financial structure must have ever more money aggregate expansion to stay solvent. This is the deadly cycle we are in. To escape, we would have to lock down our money expansion in a way that, today, would crash the dollar and cede it's reserve function to the Euro. Our bet is that we will inflate until the system fails completely. Truly, the ECB and most of EuroLand has made the same bet.

On the subject of dollar strength:

This is not the first time investors have picked the bones of a dying economy. The examples are there for reference. During the fall of Rome, traders flocked into the city to trade property and do deals,,,,,,, even as hell approached from the north. Today, the world is biding up our currency in the same insane attempt to catch the last trade before the golden goose is gone.

Where will wealth travel:

The Euro system did not build this trap. We built it ourselves by demanding a lifestyle that only debt could produce. As the years passed, our trap only grew larger. The Euro project is the result of planers seeing our trend and making ready for it's eventual finish. Yes, they are just like us but the only difference is that their train is only a small way up the hill while ours is already on the other side,,, picking up speed to the bottom. Will investors jump ship later, as big time dollar price inflation begins to mark our system to the market? Some say they won't. I say the same mentality that drives traders to buy goods in our burning dollar house today will easily send wealth to EuroLand when everything here is on fire. Look around, consider the Western perception and you judge for yourself.

Further along

Michael's mention of Bill Gate's wealth being enough to almost buy our gold reserves should speak volumes to Western Gold Bugs. Still, most of them still talk of $500,,, $600,,, $800 gold as a worthy level. It's as if they were lost in some time warp of years gone by. Truly, our money inflation has soared so fast and so far gold's real price implications are completely off their radar screen. With comments like; "$1500 gold would mean total financial destruction in this country",,,and ,,, " the gold price will only match inflation, so there is no gain in it",,,, it's clear they are lost in time and space.

Physical gold will soar when our burning dollars render the anglo paper gold credit system unworkable. Real bullion will never be able to service existing paper gold credits. Most owners will be forced to accept trailing currency payments that come in at hundreds of percent below actual bullion prices.

Because our dollar reserve structure has shielded us from a true price inflation, gold players keep looking at modern production costs as an accurate gauge to judge even the commodity production price of gold. Using that as reasoning that gold can't rise to far. Using the old logic of: " if we can produce gold for $350, then $2,000 gold would bring tonnes of it out of the woodwork and the ground!"

Well, if the dollar reserve function was removed, real goods price inflation in the production cost of gold would drive it's base dollar cost into the $0,000+++ range. And even that would only accommodate the price inflation currently in the system. With the end time drive of dollar inflation, we are now entering, gold production costs worldwide,,,, in dollar terms will soar.

Just this small area of gold's commodity function should send signals that gold prices are far removed from even Western Gold Bug reality. Truly, it will later rise to a level beyond imagination.

Still further

The fact that people are thinking out loud (in the WSJ) about allowing gold to go free ,,,, even clearing out the US reserves,,,,,, indicates the enormity of any workout to balance the current Bullion Bank mismatch. Free Gold and Credit Paper gold cannot coexist once the credit side has expanded for so long. The markdown within the banking credit system would discount all credit gold for years to come. The anglo dollar system for expanding gold credit assets would be gone for a long, long time.

In reality it should be clear to anyone that knows how governments react when the system cannot balance. Everyone goes home with what's in their hand,,,,,, as laws are abrogated and contracts are dissolved. Settlement comes in the form of something less than real, mostly cash below the mark. Stationary assets in the ground are tagged to pay way more than their fair share of the workout. Leaving the owners in the same boat as the paper players.

So, on we go,,,, as events give shape to a ghostly illusion "noone" could see from afar. The world turns and a new currency is formed,,,,,, and a new gold market takes shape.

We not only watch,,,,, we watch with understanding!

Money

Exceptional post Randy! It makes a very clear statement that's easy for us to understand:

--- Randy (@ The Tower) (06/28/01; 18:07:52MT - usagold.com msg#: 57115) Sierra Madre and the obscurities of a concept called "money" -----

I want to enter this discussion a bit and use both yours and other's statements. I'm following your lead when you wrote:

-----It's one thing to discuss money or monetary systems generically, but it's time we give the actual concept of "money" (in and of itself) some of the intense attention it
deserves, particularly here at a gold discussion forum. ---------------------( Randy #57115) Gold is definitely wealth; its a highly liquid, immutable, tradable tangible asset. For that reason some of us can never have too much of the stuff. But is it "money"? In your comment to von Braun, you indicated that our units of "dollars" were once upon a time defined as a definite quantity of gold.---------------

ALL:
the above thought creates the correct mindset for grasping just what money is. Gold is not money and never has been. No more so than hats or any other physical item. Back when we had no form of currency both hats and gold could serve the same function in trade. What was that function? The using of an item of wealth,,,,,, the using of some real thing to trade for something else we wanted.

I challenge the readership, including ORO, Journeyman and all others, to search history and show me anywhere that physical gold was traded as money. In every instance you can present, I'll show you gold used in "wealth barter" and incorrectly labeled money.

Further

The only thing that separated gold from hats or any other wealth object was gold's rarity, beauty and unique physical properties. Indeed, a hat's value was worth something in trade, no different than a gold coin. Just not worth as much as gold's value in trade. Neither gold or hats were money
then, or money now. Rather just items of wealth we trade for other items of wealth.

This very concept is what so confounds modern Hard Money thinkers and corrupts their efforts to regain the high ground of money thought and legitimate money process. It's also the mutation of this concept that, from the first introduction of "money", bankers and officialdom used to snare the hard money world.

Notice Sir Stocks, Lies, and Ticker Tape's #57150. In his post he makes a point that's perfect in example and truth of the above. But, I doubt this was his logic in making the statement. I'll reorder it for clarity.

-----Every culture upon discovery has quickly learned this monetary truth. Only in gold is money quantified.-------

Exactly, sir! Gold is the very tradable wealth that we can quantify money with. How? By giving everyone an exact amount of tradable "VALUE" to identify the currency's tradable value. The gold itself is not the money,,,, it's the tradable wealth we can value money with. In this, we know a
currency money's exact value in our economic world of trade by tying it to a real wealth piece of that economic world. Gold!

Our world today is no different than it was in ancient times. We trade things of value for things of value. We barter with each other, things for things. Only, for modern speed and convince, we use money to denominate this barter trade. Mostly paper money.

It's well known that many of us conduct only half of this barter transaction. Preferring to keep, therefore save, the paper money our barter brings us. We chose to do this instead of finishing the deal by trading the currency for something else,,,,, for some other thing. The other side of the barter deal is left open by our retention of this paper money. This is the concept of a "Money Supply" in circulation! In our modern world, we own and save the unfinished side of a barter deal.

In this we risk the loss of value said money in circulation can experience. This is the entire theater of our years of political scrambling over money. We act out the play; of trying to make this circulating money retain value. From the beginning, man has entertained countless ways to lock his "money" to some form of "fixed barter able wealth, like gold. All done in order to keep it from falling in value
before he completes the other half of the barter trade. That is spend his money. This is called price inflation and is the result of printing to much paper money. This process of tying our money to some form of tradable gold wealth does not make gold money,,,,,, it only ties the tradable value of gold to the money in a effort to slow the printing press..

We have a choice.

We can use physical gold , not money, to trade for other goods. It makes no difference whether the gold chunk is in official coin form or in pure unshaped gold form. When we use gold, outright, we are bartering wealth things for wealth things. No different than if we used the hats mentioned above. Two hats for one chair is the same barter as two chairs for one piece of gold.

The use of gold in a trade does not make said gold money in that trade. No more so than the use of hats in a trade would make hats "money". Gold is but one form of wealth that's been held throughout the ages and held for it's tradable value. It's not money. When governments mint gold coin for our use; they are minting an unit of wealth for barter trade and sanctioning it's use within our "money concept". The gold coin itself is not money and spending it constitutes wealth barter in lieu of trading money.

The other choice humankind has had is to use money to denominate all of our barter trade. In this form paper money,,,,, currency,,,, plain official coins are all just receipts of barter trade. That is what money is. It truly has little determined value outside what we can trade it for. I will give ten dollars for a hat because I have seen hats trading for around ten of those dollar receipts before. I can then use that value comparison to trade said ten bucks for a chair. This is the use of the money,,,,, the money concept.

The money concept mostly works as seen in our use of plain money for over 30 years. None of us Western users attach our money's value to gold. We attach it to what others trade it for. Yes, it has robbed us of much wealth value by saving and using it. But, even the use of gold in outright trade
barter has some historic risk. See further below.

-----Money is not real wealth. It has no real wealth anchor outside what our use makes it. We and the majority of people use modern paper money for it's convenience in trade for wealth,,,, not it's ability to be wealth. We try to make our paper moneys be worth a fixed value of real wealth by tying it to a real tradable value, gold. Our paper money's value can be as stable as our printers deem it. They can print only a fixed amount and it would retain value. Or they can print as much as possible and it's value goes down.

It has no fixed, denominated value

This is the problem of money,,,,, the problem of the money concept. Grasp tightly upon this notion:

"" The use of money is the process of trading outside of barter. Money is a concept of "denominating a wealth value" whereas barter is "trading the actual value of a real thing"

For sure, neither has a fixed long term value. Even we have a time worth limit. We all become dust at some point. Still, the tradable value of both the "money concept" and "of real wealth" can and does change with man's wants and needs. However, real wealth trading has a long history of bring
the most in trade over long time spans.

From mention above:
The barter of gold has a fine example of not holding value forever. That can be found in history when vast gold stores were brought into Europe long ago. Still, the record of
our "money concept" holding value is zero!

So, back to the problem at hand

-----( Randy #57115) But soon after, the bell ceased its clear peals, and somehow gold (under the bulk of its dollar weight *ha ha!*) got unfortunately mired down in the concept we call "money". As it turns out in the end, the "dollar" could morph itself into the "right shape" for money, but
despite gold's supreme ductility and malleability, the metal could not.---------------

Thanks Randy!

Absolutely! No currency,,,,, no money,,,,, in our history has been able to withstand the socialist expansions of man's printing press. Even his minting press had expansive ways! When we used physical gold coin alone,,,,, that barter able wealth,,,,, and labeled it money,,,, we immediately
expanded it's circulation by lending it from banks. Once it's labeled money, people will lend it and once it's lent your receipt for gold is no longer a barter able wealth,,,,,, it became part of the "money concept".

Make no mistake, mankind has before and will again use physical gold in barter by trading it wealth for wealth. But once we try to morph it into money, it's function is diminished by socialist design.

This is why the Kemp story is so important. Modern economics has come head to head with the drive by our socialist hard money school to place gold within the money world of credit bankers. A school of thought born of bankers and instituted so bankers could inflate money with no measurement by Free Gold. Once within the banking money world, the limiting nature of a "gold fix" is quickly printed away through the use of credit.

Completely opposite from what hard money thought teaches,,,, the trading of Free Gold,,,, when separate from the banking function of money,,,, enhances the utility of gold as a tradable wealth item. Ancient history proves this out. This history of barter trading of gold existed far longer than
any currency ever has,,,,,, and did so whether a money traded by gold's side or not!

That utility function,,,, the trading of god wealth thru barter,,,,, is what creates it's real demand. Such real demand for trade and savings is what makes gold rise in value, step by step with the speed of any printing press of money. The hard school notes that gold would rise way to high! I say measured in what? It would not rise at all against other things,,,, once it's utility price was reached!

From there it would mostly stay the same in value,,,, it's the moneys of the world that would fall as their never ending bubbles find their proper place in time. This was and is the only way to measure our printing press speed. It's needed, for we will never again stop those presses as they now have a digital function in this modern world.

Free Gold would allow both citizens and private investors to set the proper exchange rates for currencies and what free market interest rates to place on the same. Mr. Kemp has placed his finger exactly on this point! He is not the first to see this.

Our worldly trade function has finally hit the end of it's ability to coexist with gold and money being morphed as one. Even though the dollar left the standard years ago, gold remained in the official money credit grasp as our ongoing manipulation indicates. We can no longer afford to bastardize a wealth so important in it's trade and wealth saving function by tying it with our money concept.

This has been the thrust of the Euro Project all along as it replaces the failing dollar. The failing dollar and it's war on gold. The thrust the US is now trying to use to save it's failing system. To little, to late!

Thanks MK, Randy, ALL

Tree in the Forest,

I your #57162, it mentions -------Police will shoot, Salzburg summit protesters warned------ and other noted crimes of the day. What does this have to do with this forum? The top of the page says that this site is an ------International Discussion of Gold and the Economy------.

Do you think that the tens of thousands or readers that come here,,,,, come here to read the daily police report of who killed and robbed who in the US and Europe? The discussion here is not about whether either of these societies are evil are not. It's about how their economic and monetary
moves will impact gold and our econnomic lives.

To others,

this forum is privately owned. MK can throw me and all of us off any time he wants. The format to discuss here is at his discretion,,,,,,, not ours. Further, anyone can disagree here and every poster knows that.

So, when:
---Stocks, Lies, and Ticker Tape # 57170)-----

is making a case that one cannot disagree,,, that is a worthless statement in the eyes of every thinking person. Also, Chivalrous conduct was the manner of presentation and speech that was chosen by the owner and for us to stay here we must debate in a similar orderly civil fashion.
Otherwise there are many other forums to go to and get you head bit off! If one thinks such discussion promotes the finding of deeper truth,,,,,, then try them out?

Also, why do you think we have a "pretense of chivalrous conduct"? For myself and many other that read here, this IS the way we are! Are you telling us you are at a different level?

I wonder just what Another was thinking when he made that ------"Gold is the only money the world has ever known" Sounds like a simple thought but it isn't"??

I do wish someone would explain that post for us and how it refutes our "Money" discussion.

--------------------

Perplexed (06/29/01; 12:45:38MT - usagold.com msg#: 57169)

You say
------history has proven that those in a position of authority or power have defined money for those under their control.--------

to carry that thought further,,,,,,, the only reason people are under the (economic) control of authority is because they save their wealth in the form of the defined money! If they saved their savings in gold, and spent the money as it was earned,,,,, there would be far less control over their
economic life.

Perplexed,
We stick with the defined money because we enjoy the credit qualities it offers. Western people trap themselves because they crave the lifestyle a buy now and never pay "money system" provides them. If they did all their dealings under a wealth gold system,,,,,, cash barter on the barrel head,,,,, they would be very unhappy and throw out the officials in power.

you say
------A law defining money in the context of a given quantity, as well as quality of gold or silver as contained within our Constitution creates gold and silver money, and the only way it may be dethroned is by amendment.-------

Here you endorse the very law creating authority needed to identify money,,,,,, yet, ET and others riled against this same position when I mentioned the Euro System declaring gold a pure wealth asset without credit qualities. Do you want government in this business or no?

Well sir, the note of the "European Union rapid reaction force" is in line with noting the development of a political union and hardly goes into the details of what such a force is used for. We are all learned adults here and understand the effects of force. That is far different than your
repeat and noting ----"Iron fists in velvet gloves have much to do with our economic lives".--------

Your marking of police state actions, noting brain-washing of children and them mentioning the culling honest intellectuals from academia has no purpose on this forum except to shout tabloid sensationalism! Indeed, you lack even a shallow explanation of how these intertwine with a
currencie's development. Each and every one of your comments carry absolutely no analysis of how these items affect any stage of monetary development. Hence, my objection.

Even your statement of ------Some folks are just not going to voluntarily comply with the totalitarian dreams of would-be masters, not now and not ever---- leaves nothing for the reader to consider. We all have ideals of freedom,,,,,, yet this forum is about how the mechanics of politics and economics is impacting our gold markets and how those same will work out. That is the stated reason this forum is here. ----------

Trail Guide ---You have tap danced around the question behind my post. It was simply, what was in ET's post #57125 that warranted his code being pulled?-------

No, I didn't tap dance around anything and your simple reply indicates your reluctance to address my point. You were ""making a case that one cannot disagree on this forum"" that is not true and I pointed out your oversight in making that note. I pointed out that the decor on this forum was to
debate in a civil manner.

Your expression that ----"Differing opinions and healthy skepticism stretches the imagination"------ leaves out how said posters break the rules and said rule breaking
is the reason they are pulled.

When you say ------"The best well along the internet highway has been poisoned' ----- you are twisting the truth for your own benefit and that cannot stand.

When you say -----" If the forum is merely supposed to be a platform of solid agreement with USAGOLD, Randy, TG/FOA, Another, etc. regarding all things gold, then please drop the pretense of chivalrous conduct."--------you are the one proposing such a position and that is simply false. Anyone can differ here if they follow the discussion format and do it in a civil way.

Further you say:

-----As for your crack at my being "at a different level", perhaps I am. I can withstand criticism. I also admit when I believe I am wrong.---------

Sir, this forum is not built on a platform that requires anyone to take criticism. No one here is required to withstand such as a prerequisite to staying. When you stated -----"then please drop the pretense of chivalrous conduct."------ that remark reflected your own perception of
discussion here. It was also an insult to many of the contributors that work so hard to share their understanding. Again, ingesting your insults may be required on other forums,,,,, not here.

you say

------ANOTHER clearly states that "Gold is the only money the world has ever known", so when you claim I am wrong to say "gold is money", you must support your position.------

Sir, I did most clearly in ------Trail Guide (06/29/01; 09:47:53MT - usagold.com msg#: 57160) Money-------.

Still, I found no refute from you concerning my post. Only hollow shouts!

I will reply to each of your assertions:

------First of all, differing systems of government definitely have an effect on economics. Do you believe that the economics of the former Soviet Union was the same as the economics of the United States? ---------- No!

------Do you believe that a capitalist nation such as the US will achieve the same level of wealth as a communist nation such as North Korea? --------- No!

-----Do you believe that the Jeorg Hader incident and opposition to political parties by the EU will have no effect on what happens with the Euro?------ Yes!

----Do you honestly believe that a war will have no effect on our economic situation?----- No!

------Do you believe that a war will have no effect on gold?------ No!

------Trail Guide, I did not post information on drive-by shootings or drug deals gone bad. This was not a police report! These people were shot in the back by their own countrymen while protesting an economic forum! --------

Sir, This same sort of event happens around the world countless times a day. Your noting it begs the question, do you think myself and other people that come here to read and discuss gold issues are lost to receiving this sort of news?

------This is about a system of government that is rapidly showing us it's fascist bent. I am vehemently opposed to such systems-----

Sir, I am confident that we could find at least as many stories that confirm your same "fascist bent" in the USA if this forum was structured for such reporting. Just as I noted to Turnaound above, your report lacked any conclusions to connect it to gold or Euro / dollar policy and reeked of
tabloid sensationalism. After reading your statement again, I note that it also supports your political slant. While valid, it was not for the betterment of this forum but for the expression of your "vehement opposition". Again, we are not here for that!

----What I have posted is very much about political upheaval and history tells us that this will indeed effect economics and gold.------

Again, Without giving us some conclusions,,,, or at least pre supporting your assumptions ahead with other posts,,,,, you sir are insulting us with tabloid sensationalism!

------We are just starting to see this mayhem now as a country engaged in a currency war tries to force it's political and economic policies down it's own people's throats.-------

Sir, This is your perception and perhaps of a few others. I and many other readers do not accept your big brother scare innuendoes and feel the prudent allocation of wealth assets will see us thru most of this.

------ I intend to continue to bring up the political situation in Europe when I think it applies
to our future monetary problems.------

Well, I for one hope you do, but only if leaves out the obvious blood shed and sensationalism and
contains some form of discussion to explain how it will impact the gold and currency markets.

Chilling @ET, Stocks, Lies & Ticker Tape, Randy, ALL

Sir,

I object to your discrete suggestions that this site is some form of police state! Your line of propositions is an outrage to every person that has worked years to build this forum into what it is today! Your returning post is outright insulting!

you say

------If so, why? Such questions are important. Here's why:
There is a word that the U.S. Court system likes to use in discussing freedom of speech and censorship. That word is "chill." --------

This line alone is directed at the very core of this body. You of all people have had the most latitude to speak here and now you return with accusatory oratory!

----Censorship can be quite subtle and even unconscious, and sometimes has effects even the censors don't intend. -----------The problem with censorship, or the perception of it, no matter the circumstances, and especially when things aren't well defined (and even when they are), is that people become afraid to talk about all sorts of things. That's what "chill" means.-----

Sir, the rules here are well defined and speech is wide open,,,,,, if civil! Censorship here is not unconscious and very intentional! The only people here that are afraid to talk are the ones that insult and attack others,,,,,, the ones that break the posting rules!

you say:
------One poster just e-mailed me recently saying he was only reading here once in a while now because things were getting boring and repetitive. Don't know if this represents any kind of consensus, but variety IS the spice of life.------

I suggest that these posters should go the the other sites that allow anyone to be cursed, insulted and shouted down! In these they may find your spice a little much!

------It can also be argued, in line with the title of Mises' major work, that any activity that involves
"Human Action" is grist for the economic mill. Which makes it, if the proper connections are drawn, relevant to gold and theoretically at least, on topic here. Sometimes posters do tend to leave out the appropriate connections, however;) ---------

Murder, robbery, sensational stories without an economic connection are grist for the tabloids,,,,,, not here!

------Intentional or not, I feel a definite drop in temperature in the room and would suggest someone might want to do something about it before things "chill" people so much there's an exodus of uncomfortable folks large enough to drop this forum below "critical mass."-----


******
This last note is an absolute outrage! Was your intention of returning here only to thrust a spear into our long work?

I also duly noted your recent reply to ORO,,,,,, asking him to cool it in the same manner as your own expression to me. First you attack my words with insulting remarks then after I offer that we could discuss over "burgers and beer",,,,, you change your approach. Sir, it is your "chill"

Bush to throw 'protectionist bombshell' at Europe

FROM CHRIS AYRES IN NEW YORK

FEARS are growing that President Bush could throw a "protectionist bombshell" at Europe in retaliation for it blocking the $42 billion (£30 billion) acquisition of Honeywell International by General Electric.

The EU's decision to block the merger of the US industrial groups — which it could announce as early as tomorrow — is the latest in a series of transatlantic trade disputes that have strained relations between Washington and Brussels. The disputes, which threaten to trigger a full-scale trade war between two of the world's biggest trading partners, come on top of transatlantic tensions over other issues such as the environment.

The most likely target of US protectionism is the European steel industry. President Bush last week angered the EU by using section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act to launch a six-month investigation into the impact of European imports on the struggling US steel industry.

If the investigation finds that imports are harming the US, President Bush can impose quotas on imports, punitive tariffs and other protectionist measures. This could have a devastating effect on European steelmakers, including Britain's Corus, which export about five million tonnes of finished steel products to the US a year.

The steel dispute comes amid an equally damaging row over tax subsidies given to US companies operating in Europe. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) last month ruled that the Bush Administration was breaking international trade regulations by offering the subsidies, and opened the door for the EU to impose $4 billion in sanctions against the US.

Robert Zoellick, the US trade representative, said that imposing the sanctions would be like dropping a "nuclear weapon" on trade relations between the two continents.

The US has already failed to hide its anger over the EU's rejection of the Honeywell deal. The EU also last year blocked AOL Time Warner's acquisition of EMI Group, the British record company. There are concerns in Washington that the EU has a hidden anti-US agenda.

President Bush recently said that he was concerned about the
EU's stance on Honeywell, while Donald Evans, the Commerce
Secretary, pleaded with the EU to clear the industrial merger.

Attempts by Washington to influence the EU's investigation last month provoked a furious response from Mario Monti, the EU's Competition Commissioner. He said: "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention. This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has had no impact on the Commission whatsoever. This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Imposing tough sanctions on European steel imports would be a popular move for President Bush in the US. The Speciality Steel Industry of North America, said last week: "We believe that substantial dumping continues in the US marketplace. We will closely monitor developments and, if and when appropriate, will ask the Administration to initiate additional section 201 cases on affected products."

Washington and Brussels are already involved in a related row over steel duties. The EU has threatened to take the US to a WTO dispute panel over its "anti-subsidy duties" on steel imports from about 16 European companies.

The EU won a similar WTO case last year against the US over
duties on imports of leaded bars produced by Corus.

I must go where "Ears do not bite"!

I don't believe it people, but I guess this was bound to happen!

I just spent several days writing a piece that explained our whole philosophy. This time in a clear positive manner that was easy to read. I had decided to stay on the GoldTrail page only and elevate our discussion into a real time dialog. Events are close enough to a conclusion to warrant
this. After a ton of asking and asking I finally convinced Another to write with me in his true academic / professional voice. Great! No more editing for me.

So,,,, he gets today's forum from me and what does he read?

===============

OK,,,,,,, good job men! Perfect timing! On subject and driving home the quality of this venue! I complained in two of my last three post about such discussion and most everyone here seemed to support a "freedom of speech" that included all of the above! Journeyman gets to associate Another with" indoctrination" and "Nazi" thought.

All right,,, good stuff J-man!

Well,,,,,, Michael,,,,,, Randy,,,,,,, All,,,,, For all my insisting to "him" that this venue was the correct place to build an understanding of our future world of gold,,,, I guess I was wrong? I got back a quick retort and firm instructions. Instruction I will follow till hell freezes over because I will not lose my connection to Another. He said simply "tell them right now our position and walk away, it's over"! And I can tell you when he says it's over,,,,, it is over!

So,,,,,,,,, MK, please understand that it's not old FOA walking away mad this time. The big guy said we are done. I'm back to discussing this in private with select people that want to hear it and debate it in private. I'll stay in touch with you and discuss as you may want? After all this work, I guess it's my turn to feel low now. What a bunch of garbage!

Good luck all, I did my best to plant the seeds of thought. Own the wealth of gold and they will grow for you!

You will now "watch this new gold market" without FOA or Another.

On the trail.

Has everyone seen West Side Story? Or for that matter any story that portrayed human group loyalties and commitment. How about the Three Musketeers? These stories and plays reflect our involvement in groups and often depict how we stand together as a team. In the first case a gang, in the second as "all for one and one for all". In the second, if one member is insulted it's a reflection on the whole group. If that hurt one walks away then the whole bunch is suppose to walk together?

Well, it's no different in political circles, too. My interaction here at USAGOLD is similar to a tiny part of our political world. A world some of my friends call home, no less. It's very clear to most of them that I'm not actually political here, just calling plays as I see them on the field. All done for the benefit of whomever has tuned into this station and wishes to hear.

It should also be clear that I have walked away this time, just enough to still honor the cause. Far enough to make a point,,, yet close enough that my private thoughts and discussions can still be heard. Thoughts and discussion with a message of gold's evolving place in the world.

So, on this Trail only, I now must remain.

Onward

As we begin today, I noticed a side path that lead away from the GoldTrail. At it's end I see a group of people listening to some person standing on a tiny stage. Let's ease over there and see what this funny looking guy is saying.

Onward now,,, quietly:

================

Gentlemen, thank you for coming here today. Once again I'll be offering up some of my views pertaining to gold's new place in the world. For those new here we are covering the subject, today, in a somewhat broader manner. Again, thank
you for your time and consideration.

I see we have several Americans here tonight. Good! You can help explain to anyone seated next to you, what "a roadrunner" is. That little ground running bird is native to a good portion of the southwestern United States: the object of a children's cartoon years ago. It seemed he was always running around some mountain curve at incredible speeds! I always liked the part when he would chase other characters so fast that he sometimes ran right off the cliff side road! Then ended up suspended in mid air; his little legs going full speed as if he never knew he left the road.

Ha! Ha! You know, I always think of that image when listening to modern Western Gold Bugs. Especially over the last ten years or so. Like our "roadrunner" cartoons, they carried their hard metal message so long and so fast that they ran right off the Trail, too. Not knowing that our Gold path would one day curve and follow it's natural way back to it's beginnings.

Over this time a lot of hard money thinkers stayed suspended in that same position. Right up there in the open for all to see. Over and over they would look over at us "new thinkers", standing on the mountain and yell:

---"you fells are on soft economic ground and it's all gona slide out from under ya"!-----

Hearing that we would lean over the edge and just yell back;

------"we know that, but mind your legs guys and keep um moving"! It's a long way down if you stop out there!" ----------

Ho! Ho! Ok, all of you can see where I am going with this.

=============================

For years we had this image in our heads that gold was a hedge. A hedge against what? You name it: war, disease, bankruptcy, inflation, bank failure, money failure! If something caused a problem in mankind's world, then gold was a good thing to perform as a hedge against it.

It didn't take much leg work to research why so many thought that way. We had a whole world of history to reference this and the last couple of centuries produced copious works by noted economic thinkers on the subject. Most all of their work could be boiled down into a few simple concepts for us lesser minds to understand.

Let's see...... gold is money...... gold was used as money....... and gold circulated as official government money not too many decades ago. And one more........ no currency could live without gold money backing it.

So, it seemed that if for any good reason we had a disturbance in "the economic force" then all roads must eventually lead back to gold use in it's well known money context. It's demand would surge while it's price rose and that price action would hedge our other loses. That is loses we incurred to our net worth because of any of these mentioned problems. Fair enough. I can understand that. In fact, I think most everyone did.

--------------------------------------------

But what happened? Over the last 30 years or so, something seemed to be changing in the way all of us perceived our need for gold. Indeed, was it perhaps that this new world was ignorant of the fact that a fiat currency could never last as money? Was mankind now blind to the known fact that a fiat currency, once removed from it's association with real gold money, was dead on arrival?

From 1971 thru 1980, we had every form of the above mentioned problems. In triplicate! Our dollar, stripped of gold backing, was surely on it's last legs and slowly sliding into failure. It was officially a fiat currency that we all were taught would burn from inflation in a short time. Yes, gold went to $800 but it should have kept on going if it was this historic money? There were enough
dollar assets in the world to buy up every ounce and then some! Thereby replacing all that fiat wealth with gold wealth! Still, the real demand for actual physical gold failed to drive the price higher or sop up any and all gold offered. Something just didn't add up.

We were not without teachings on this! Anyone, with any understanding of economic function or hard money theory, knew that super price inflation was coming and that action would drive the real demand for gold to the moon. Still, it didn't happen. Our dollar price inflation was mild by failing fiat standards and gold never left the launch site.

---------------------

Another fifteen years went by. A period of time that should have vaporized any circulating fiat currency, unattached to gold. Especially as the world's reserve currency was printed in numbers that only a computer could add up. It seemed the general public was not as lost as hard money thought predicted. They kept right on dealing and saving in dollars, leaving physical gold to drift.

Looking closer at the big picture:

It further seemed that through out our recent decades of changing economic function, the use and need for currency fiat was being impacted by a new demand use. Something not fully understood, but there never the less. This market action was not lost to some planners. Planners in big political systems that had opposite game plans from each other. Both trying to use fiat's and gold's changing function for their own advantage. On one side their designs would eventually rework everything, including removing our dollar system. On the other their reasoning was to just survive... gold or no.

Truly, over this time, we experienced every form of financial dislocation. Some inflation with some deflation,,, wars and political failure,,, 3rd world economic failures and even swings between small storms and perfect storms! Still, underneath it all, riding just beneath the surface, this "new demand" force was affecting the use of what most thought was a worthless currency. Helping to keeping fiat use in tact, even without it's needed gold money backing. Something different was happening. Something as unique and impossible to hard money thought as "computer bytes" were once unique and impossible to the function of a new economic world.

=========================

To be sure, this whole fiat system was engaged for political motivations. Governments waged war against gold and other fiats for various reasons. Some factions fought gold to protect the image of their currency. This was a throwback to 30 years ago and was still important to certain big players.

Until a few years ago, a currencies gold price still indicated said currencies value. Some also waged war to keep gold in a range so others could accumulate real physical cheaper. Almost like an economic bribe?

In these and other functions, credit gold was employed to shape a lower trading price for physical gold. As long as the currency using public or the gold using industry didn't demand too much gold to settle expiring credit gold contracts,,,,, the unlimited nature of fiat based gold trading allowed as much paper gold to be sold to as many that wanted to buy. While all of this was but simple political maneuvering, it could not have been pulled off without the help of that mentioned above; a "new currency demand".

Political forces noticed that the public was well attached to using fiat without gold backing. Most were more engaged to bet on gold's price, as a hedge, instead of owning gold outright, as a hedge. With such a setup in play, the paper gold market could be expanded without physical settlement
fear. All the more so if traders, betting mostly on gold's price, feared a currency loss as much as physical delivery. In this, they always dumped their dropping contracts to settle in cash before the dreaded delivery ever came.

For sure, over all this time people brought and kept gold in large amounts. But that demand and it's trading volume was a trifle in the overall physical and paper trading volume.

================

The total demand for holding physical gold as a hedge was falling away just as it was needed to force credibility upon a inflating world dollar gold system. Without full physical demand, gold stores, worldwide could circulate in an ever lower price spiral. Always leading it's old disgruntled owners to sell, fulfilling just enough settlement for the next real gold buyer. Only to be repeated again and again as the paper system produced another lower value for each new buyer/ owner. Eventually bringing gold to it's plateau price today. Where it is trapped between the falling demand to use physical ownership to hedge currency risk and digital currency's new use demand that keeps economic players in the fiat game.

I suspect that if a tremendous dislocation event occurred today,,, under the current dollar gold system,,,, our paper gold price would indeed collapse! It would do this as investors committed to hard money thought failed their own cause. Them and others would continued to cycle real gold out of their portfolios,,,, round and round the circuit,,,,,, as contract gold prices fell away. Contract
owners would drive those prices ever lower in their rush to escape even the illusion of delivery.

To the incredible shock of our modern "roadrunners" their gold would slowly fall in almost any financial panic. Falling in price as their neighbors traded each and every last ounce down to the bottom. Only if a complete currency / banking washout occurred would gold find demand as a real wealth trading vehicle again. The only kind of demand in our modern world that will once again return gold to it's ancient value ranges.

But this is not the end of the story. Nor is it how the final act of this play will unfold. I expect the above wealth demand to be politically reinstated. And timed to destroy the credibility of our current dollar paper gold system.

This ongoing discussion will embrace and follow this political reality as it unfolds in our time. Unfolding into what is about to become the greatest bull market in gold our world has ever seen. To fully understand how this will come about, we need to understand how some political forces are using both gold's and fiat's changing function in our modern economic structure. To grasp that, we all must understand what money is today, yesterday and tomorrow.

So keep those little feet going mr. roadrunner!

We will pull you back in long before gold hits $30,000.
Count on it! (smile)

===================================
===========

OK folks, this is more than one can stand for a day. Let's quietly ease back to the trail and think about all that for a while.

Michael, Randy,,,,,, I hope this system has a lot of space because I can tell that I (errrr,,I mean this fella) has a lot to say! He also needs to address where others think his view is all wrong. Who knows? I could be all wet! It's going to be an long discussion for everyone reading, too!
Especially if you two guys join in?

Uhhhh,,,,, I didn't mean that the way it sounded (smile)

thanks

The evolving message of gold

Hello everyone,

Once again, after walking only a short distance, we come to a clearing where a speaker is beginning his talk. Let's just stand here on the hillside and quietly listen!

==================================

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening an welcome to our ongoing traveling talks on the changing world of gold. Thanks again for being here and we will get started now.

Much thanks to the USAGOLD people for recording and reproducing these discussions. Also a hardy appreciation to their Randy for organizing all our thoughts as they were presented in the TrailGuide context.

I begin tonight by reading an item from the very first TrailGuide walk. Then proceeding on to expand in more detail from our points in earlier talks. For the benefit of those who missed our last discussion, this thought picks up that theme very well:

"""""""""""""""" Our most broad view, expressing our strongest position is this:
From ten or perhaps twenty years ago a political will, a concept, was being formed that would today change the economic architecture and power structure of the world. Within this change, gold would undergo one of the most visible transformations since it was first used as money. We expect that, starting three or four years ago, the gold market itself has started responding to this sea change. As such, in our time, physical gold will enter the greatest bull phase in it's human use history. This my friends is the very trail we walk today. During our hikes and fireside chats, we will point out this political will, consider the logic and express our reasoning for this position. All the while observing the "river current", in the form of events, that will soon confirm our view."""""""""""""""""""""""""

=======================

First off, I want all of you to know that I was a hard money Gold Bug for decades. Actually, I still am in many ways. Yes, in spirit I am one of those little "roadrunners" mentioned in our last talk. Still storming down the gold money trail. Fortunately for me, and my portfolio position, I started looking at a realistic human / political side of money thought. A side most of us never grasped quickly enough to help us; because evolution was changing it before our understanding could catch up. My slow learning curve was speeded up with help from some very sharp people. Today I still see things using a hard money position; but, just as the world has turned and time passed by, my position has evolved quickly enough to flow with our human tide.

==============

The major object of our discussion tonight is this thought:

--- the present state of affair in our gold market isn't just the result of political motive alone. --

I'm carrying this over from our last talk; that mentioned a new demand for fiat.

Yes, it's true; a simple political motive explanation would, indeed, solve all our problems. For many Gold Bugs this explanation does end their need to think much further on the subject, but their continued financial loses in the gold arena says their problem was never solved as such. Indeed, there is plenty of political push and pull going on to overtly move the market and we will later cover most of that in other talks. But, to underscore our isolated point, tonight, we magnify a few thoughts.

==================

Had the dollar run it's inflationary course, in a manner and time period that history records all fiats as doing, there would have not been any contest for us to follow. From 1971, had dollar prices of everything soared, as hard money theory said it should have, every asset in the world would have seen hyper prices reflecting our run from this inflating currency. Perhaps not all of the wealth held in dollars would have went into real gold: some of it surely would have competed against the politically contrived paper gold markets. But, in spite of official thrusts, enough cash would have went into physical to drive it's physical dollar price to at least $1,000 or $3,000 over the last 30 years. It didn't.

The dollar did very much inflate from a printing press viewpoint and did so without massive price inflation. A 30 year repudiation of much hard money dictum. This tremendous rate of currency creation could not have been contained in a way that held off price rises with coordinated Central Bank support alone. The amounts of currency created and the build up of official assets held in CB vaults, to support the inflating currency, did not come close to matching each other. Even in a reverse fractional banking context. This one observation, simple to grasp as it is, points to another demand for fiat currency that did not exist when hard money thought was first built.

Over the last few decades a new demand use for digital money, or fiat unbacked paper money, has helped absorb most of this extra printing. The velocity of and gross increases of both private and world trade gave a use to worthless digital transactions and helped build a value that didn't exist in fiat currency before. This effect had to be real, because the world took in every last dollar that was printed and didn't dump them off to buy other real assets. A process that would have matched printed money rates to price inflation rates! I'm speaking of dollars alone, of course.

And there is more to observe that this alone.

======================

In recent society's demonstrated use of unbacked fiat currency, they were advancing a trend to use currency in trade only; while owning wealth assets outside the known money context. As society advanced and trading volumes mushroomed, the need for more digital units increased more so from their trading function than their value retaining function.

This process was rendering the whole school of hard money thought useless as a strategy to to defend one's savings from inflation: as these inflating digital units failed to create a meaningful price inflation. The expanding universe of fiat was best used to gather real wealth, at stable fiat values, each time the fiat cycled through your domain. The object became; to gain fixed value wealth in quantity instead of gaining finite wealth and waiting for it to gain in value.


This is all completely beside the point that all this action will one day destroy the dollar unit as a saving / debt denominating vehicle. We will get to that later. Right now we are gaining an understanding about this money evolution in it's basic trade use and how we should advance ourselves using it.

====================

Owning wealth aside from official money units is nothing new. Building up one's storehouse of a wealth of things is the way societies have advanced their kind from the beginning. What is new is that this is the first time we have used a non wealth fiat for so long without destroying it through price inflation. Again, a process of using an unbacked fiat to function as money and building up real assets on the side. Almost as if two forms of wealth were circulating next to each other; one in the concept of money and the other in the concept of real wealth.

This trend is intact today and I doubt mankind will ever pull back from fiat use again. Fiat used solely in the function of a money concept that I will explain of in a moment. If we inflate this currency to it's death, and I expect we will, then the world will just start a new one and the process goes on. Note the minor examples of this process in various third world currencies as they kill their own kind and advance to using the king fiat dollar. The local currency printers eventually fail their task, so the next nation state's fiat comes into use. Currently, in the major category, the dollar is giving way to the Euro. Ha! Ha! In logical progression of this we will, one day three hundred years from now, be using the new mighty Argentina whatever as the world's next great fiat. (smile)

=======================================

Understanding all of this money evolution, in it's correct context, is vital to grasping gold's eventual place in the world. A place where it once proudly stood long ago. In the time before us, fiat monetary policy, interest rates, appropriate debt levels and even speculative stock market binges will all be regulated to how a fiat does it's singular job of being just money; not functioning as a long term savings vehicle. How well that job is performed will depend on a free market trading value of gold wealth.

All of this transition is killing off our Gold Bug dream of official governments declaring gold to be money again and reinstitution some arbitrary gold price. Most of the death, on that hand, is in the form of leveraged bets on gold's price as the evolution of gold from official money to a wealth holding bleeds away any credible currency pricing of gold's value in the short run.

To understand gold we must understand money in it's purest form; apart from it's manmade convoluted function of being something you save. Money in it's purest form is a mental association of values in trade; a concept in memory not a real item. In proper vernacular; a 1930s style US gold coin was stamped in the act of applying the money concept to a real piece of tradable wealth. Not the best way to use gold, considering our human nature.

=======================

Modern society thought, has taken a step beyond our schooled understanding of money. Going beyond, by taking a step backwards and embracing a practice more real. By accepting and using dollars today, that have no inherent form of value, we are reverting to simple barter by value association. Assigning value to dollar units that can only have a worth in what we can complete a trade for. In effect, refining modern man's sophisticated money thoughts back into the plain money concept if first began as; a value stored in your head! Sound like something that's way over your
head of understanding? I'll let you teach yourself.

==================

So, you think we have come a long way from the ancient barter system; where uneducated peoples simply traded different items of value for what they thought they were worth. Crude, slow and demanding, these forms of commerce would never work today because we are just too busy.
Think again?

Lean back and think of all the items you can remember the dollar price for? Quite a few, yes? Now, run through your mind every item in your house; wall pictures, clothes, pots and pans, furniture, Tvs, etc.? Mechanics can think about all the things in the garage, tools, oil, mowers. If one thinks hard enough they can remember quite well what they paid for each of these. Even think of things you used at work? Now try harder; think of every item you can remember and try to guess the dollar value of it within, say, 30%. Wow, that is a bunch to remember, but we do do it!

I have seen studies where, on average, a person can associate the value of over 1,000 items between unlike kinds by simply equating the dollar price per unit. Some people could even do two or three thousand items. The very best were some construction cost estimators that could reach 10,000 or more price associations!

Still think we have come a long way from trading a gallon of milk for two loves of bread? In function, yes; in thought no! Aside from the saving / investing aspects of money, our process of buying and selling daily use items hasn't changed all that much. You use the currency as a unit to value associate the worth of everything. Not far from rating everything between a value of one to ten; only our currency numbers are infinite. Now, those numbers between one and ten have no value, do they? That's right, the value is in your association abilities. This is the money concept, my
friends.

Unlike the efficient market theory that was jammed down our throats in schools, we all still use value associations to grasp what things are worth to us. Yes, the market may dictate a different price, but we use our own associations to judge whether something is trading too high or too low for our terms. We then choose to buy or sell at market anyway, if we want to.

In this, we have moved little from basic barter. In this, we are understanding that an unbacked fiat works because we are returning to mostly bartering with one another. A fiat trading unit works today because we make it take on the associated value of what we trade it for; it becomes the very money concept that always resided in our brains from the beginnings of time.

In this, a controlled fiat unit works as a trading medium; even as it fails miserably as a retainer of wealth the bankers and lenders so want it to be.

================================

The American dollar has brought it's makers a lifestyle that is at odds with this new thrust in money use. A reserve currency today must allow it's value to be set solely upon it's money function, not it's function of retaining wealth. Use trends today are forcing money creation policy and money values to be determined by wealth outside the official money realm. All the while the dollar holders are fighting to stop this from happening. Free Gold markets would today destroy the current dollar exchange rates and render it's debt creation null and void as a proxy to buy us things for free. Much is at risk to the lifestyle our old gold dollar relationships brought us if gold trades free. Much is to be gained for wealth savers, today, who buy gold for it's wealth function and forget it's current dollar created price.

================

I'll go further into the other aspect of money titled; "Who said we were suppose to save this stuff"!

Next time in our talks on the evolving message of gold. Good night and thank you for being here.

=========================================

Ok, folks! I checked the schedule and there are several more of these talks coming. After those are done, we can take a real good hike and check out where the trail is going. The GoldTrail that is!

Thanks all

Why do we need to save this stuff anyway?

Hello everyone.

Can't believe I brought folding chairs on the trail! (smile) I guess I'll also take notes with the others here. Hey, lower in the front, I can't see! OK, it's getting started. Let's hear what that guy is getting into this time.

=======================

Good evening. I hope all of you rested well into the morning and had time to consider our thoughts from last night. Today's talk is, once again, a more detailed continuation of our theme: the evolving message of gold. I'll begin now.

Again I'll read a small piece from the TrailGuide series and use some slight editing to make it more clear. From that we can move into our subject:

"""""""" Our modern gold market and the price illusion it creates is little more than a product of the fiat dollar system; a design that denominates the trading of most gold credits in a contract form. Is it a free market? Why yes, very free. But, really free, in the sense that contract supply is unlimited. Investors and the gold industry, in total, brought into this paper based gold; even though they fully well knew 90% of the trading volume was represented by only cash equity collateral on the other side. Some of it private and some of it official. Knowing that, they somehow expected that those contracts were limited in creation by the fixed amount of gold in the world. Their mistake, not the markets.

Clearly, anyone schooled in classic hard money Thought should have known that this was but another gold inflation; another version of a typical fiat gold inflation and a transitory era between money systems. This was a time to gather gold over years, not invest in the leveraged aspects of gold's new fiat versions. Nor, to buy into the gold industry that owed it's life and cash profits to the
maintenance of such a system; transitory as it was."""""""

====================

To paraphrase that TrailGuide thought let's repeat what I said last night:

""The expanding universe of fiat was best used to gather real wealth, at stable fiat values, each time the fiat cycled through your domain. The object became; to gain fixed value wealth in quantity instead of gaining finite wealth and waiting for it to gain in value.""

Anyone, that understood this new fiat era, knew that this is how you handled the evolving process. For myself and others, knowing that gold's inherent value could not change much and was historically undervalued in it's comparative value to all things, we brought gold in quantity. We tossed aside Western concerns about shifting currency prices of gold. We did not try to paper leverage a finite amount of it; as some were trying to do in betting for a higher currency price to come. A price value, by the way, that would never arrive in this era. That higher dollar currency price, so many were leveraging for, would not be allowed to surface in paper values while the present pricing system still functioned.

It was plain as day that the whole world could sell gold short; with most financing deals and future deliveries predominantly structured towards cash settlement. With little more than margin money and no gold at all; you, me and that "man behind the tree" could all help set the price of gold lower with little thought of dealing in actual physical metal. With such a system firmly ensconced in investor minds, as the one and only true gold market, only a partial percentage of the coming price rise could ever be reflected on paper; as gold's price discovery system was and is eventually inflated until it fails it's purpose.

Such is the way our gold arena has evolved in our present financial culture. This entire realm represents the conclusion of a convoluted, decades long, attempt by mankind to tie his fiat money concepts to physical gold. These centuries of gold / money tie-ins will end in a colossal breakup of the entire fiat money plus gold concept; leaving gold and fiat to trade independently of each other.

Unfortunately, it's the dollar's watch this will all end on as this gold failure is running in parallel to the dollar ending it's position as a world reserve currency.

====================================

The dollar faction's war on gold is now lost as their whole system of fiat gold creaks under a load of failing credibility. That failing credibility is being driven home as the Euro system pumps far more dollar based paper gold sales into the system than their actual physical gold sales. All the while structuring a stand alone system, aside our present dollar gold world, that will later identify gold's
pure value in traded physical only form. For all of Europe, London sales included, the BIS sanctioned Washington Agreement was little more than a settlement of some official accounts; taking their CBs somewhat out of harm's way prior to an unimaginable rise in gold values.

The US Treasury, coming a little late to this recognition, is trying to get in the game by renaming some of it's gold stocks. They are trying to show some involvement; but their political motive, to actually deed over their gold, will only become powerful enough after the real breakup begins. The great gold reserves, so many Americans think they own, will leave our shores at prices we will later think are sky high; only to watch those values double and triple again! The US will be forced to use a good portion of it's gold to just keep the dollar in the game; still, no amount of gold will make it a reserve currency again.

=========================================

The incredible simple design, of using gold in the Euro political thrust, is what has hidden it from our Western view. So far, have we advanced, that few of us can fathom gold ownership having any purpose outside using it for leverage gain and credit lending. Four fifths of the rest of the world will later grasp the Euro concept and embrace it completely.

While many in the gold industry note the harm this paper selling is doing, we can hardly fault the Euro side's reasoning behind the paper sales. It's no different than selling short a stock you think is going to become worthless. Any investors that brought these paper gold goodies, because they thought they represented real gold, can just put up the cash and ask for delivery! The trouble is that the ones that point to the Euro CB sales and yell the loudest, never had the cash to buy or intended to buy gold anyway. They played the game for more dollars, not gold! They cannot see the different political gold reasoning behind Euro faction thrust vs. dollar faction thrust and proclaim that these are one in the same. Confusing the issue for all gold investors.

And the beat goes on!

===========================

Looking back, for a moment, at our last talk about the money concept; we can see where most of our money failings originated from our thinking that gold was, itself, money. Actually one writer, on the USAGOLD forum, hit the nail on the head when he said that; "money is just a book keeping accounting of real wealth". Indeed, as we mentioned in our last talk, money is an associated value in your memory and, for help, usually recorded on paper.

We were first alerted to the "gold is money" flaw years ago. When considering the many references to gold being money, in ancient texts, several things stood out. We began to suspect that those translations were somewhat slanted. I saw many areas, in old text, where gold was actually more in a context of; his money was in account of gold or; the money account was gold or; traded his money in gold. The more one searches the more one finds that in ancient times gold was simply one item that could account for your money values. To expand the reality of the thought; everything we trade is in account of associated money values; nothing we trade is money!

The original actual term of money was often in a different concept. In those times barter, and their crude accounts of the same, were marked down or remembered as so many pots, furs, corn, tools traded. Gold became the best accepted tradable wealth of the lot and soon many accountings used gold more than other items to denominate those trades. Still, money was the account, the rating system for value, the worth association in your head. Gold, itself, became the main wealth object used in that bookkeeping.

This all worked well for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years as fiat was never so well used or considered. Over time, society became accustomed to speaking of gold in the context of money accounting. Translations became all the more relaxed as gold and money accounting terms were mingled as one in the same. It was a subtle difference, then, but has become a major conflict in the money affairs of modern mankind; as gold receipts became fiat gold and bankers combined fiat money accounting with gold backing.

=================================

Last night we alluded that humans have not changed all that much in their barter trade associations. We, today, use fiat record keeping to associate trades for every thing we want. It's in the same mental concept people used a thousand years ago. Our tendency is to freely trade and value things up and down the association scale; that flexibility in our association accounting means fiats cannot remained fixed to any real wealth. In modern money terms and concepts; that means the prices of all things must be free to flow up and down in any amount. Our modern perceptions of inflation and deflation upon debt values only serve to destroy the understanding of this basic drive.

This need to change valuations is a human trait and is the main force that keeps attempting to break gold free from modern money attachments. We inherently wish to use gold as wealth and trade it's changing value within the same universe of moving values all other tradable things exist in. However, for credit banking sake, we tried to fix gold's value into our fiat money accounting so we could lend the "money concept itself"; lend money in lieu of real things. As just said, gold could never be attached rigidly in our accounting money concept because that requires it's value to be fixed

============================

Our world has built fiat system after fiat system; and all upon the notion that the money concept can be lent in lieu of lending wealth. This debt, in money terms, requires said money values to remain stable or the banking system fails it's purpose. In this, governments, banks and political stylists always try to entwine gold into the money system and control it's value for the sake of money debt viability. Such is the conflict in our gold money culture today. Our dollar is just one more fiat coming to the end of it's timeline as it's basic flawed concept, again, destroys the savers wealth.

The question stands in modern times: Why do we need to save this stuff anyway? Indeed, fiat is only a trading medium that reflects our 1 to 10 value rating of any good in trade; and that rating is a just value for only a short time. Fiat purpose is maintained for those that save it for later use over short terms, not long term accumulation as wealth or for spending far in the future. Real wealth is what humans save for the future and this is where our basic instincts drive us.

The incredible explosion of fiat use, sense it became a non wealth holding in 1971, bears this out. Fiat values, the world over, reflect only our tradable values placed on all things. The dollar, nor the Euro, have any value of themselves except for the denomination of tradable goods. The mismatch that has occurred is in the massive debt our world dollar use has developed. A debt that cannot be traded back into the US economy to receive goods at anything close to today's prices.

For years American lifestyles encouraged it's political system to protect their banking /debt credibility at all costs; so we could buy others real goods without sending real wealth to pay for it. We did this in the only way we knew how; in body, mind and spirit, our political economic purpose promoted the dollar and it's debt to be as good as gold and a substitute for real wealth holdings. Even a substitute for real wealth to be held in reserve behind other currencies! Still, in parallel to this US thrust; for thirty years fiat use evolved on it's own to embrace the non wealth trading aspects of "the money concept". Leaving in it's wake a world of worthless dollar debt as people brought wealth outside the "money concept" anyway. We are, today, in a transition away from that dollar mess and much of our wealth illusion will passing from our grasp in the process.

In every way, society is trading it's way back to where it started. In the process, gold will find a new value from it's history in the past:

" a wealth of ages savings for your future of today."

Thank you for attending these workshops. We will continue these discussions for a time and later envelop current events into our thoughts. It's been my pleasure, good evening.

==================================


OK,,,,, I'm out of here,,,,,I think I'll just fold my chair,,,,, hike over to the Trail restaurant for some
Tuscany vintage and good Italian food,,,,, not to mention a plate full of political sauce. (smile)

Amazing how the GoldTrail connects to so many parts of life, society and economics!

Thanks

"The wind will blow"

Hello all!

I thought it was a good idea to tack this notice on a large tree.

It says that:

"another talk is to be given here tomorrow (fri) on the evolving message of gold"...... The Wind Will Blow!

Ok,,,,, good enough for me,,,, I'll bring some coffee and snacks. Unless a storm blows in and shuts down the presentation,,, we'll see everyone then.

"The Wind Will Blow"

Welcome to our next series of talks on the evolving message of gold. Today's discussion is titled;

"The Wind Will Blow".

==========

As our modern society has evolved, we currently use fiat and own wealth in a way that demonstrates exactly where both values stand within our lifestyles. The examples abound everywhere in personal finances. Fiat has, today, become both a trading medium and short term savings asset. This long trend, in American money use, suggest that an acceptable price inflation cost for both theses uses has been evident for some time. Even though world use of our reserve currency has made an illusion of most of our real costs structures.

The concept that wealth is the long term savings asset that most strive to attain has been evident also. Even with US taxes on it's profits, real wealth assets still overcome that disadvantage by providing far less risk in an increasingly hostile world. However, in the background, behind the enormous, overshadowing expansion of public and personal debt, this new meaning and usage's of wealth and fiats are difficult to perceive. Most of what the general public has come to believe as real wealth is simply forms of paper ownership of wealth producing industries and paper claims on real assets that can never be recovered at today's values. This is true in most all items, not just gold.

Aside from Western cultures taking this debt expansion far beyond their means, our trend of buying things and not saving fiat currency, long term, should have sent a signal to money officials; but it didn't. Dollar inflation was exploding to meet a new fiat use demand and not creating a price inflation to match: a process that should have encouraged our economic engines, the people, to save the currency itself. In hindsight, they were spending it; not to escape future run-a-way price rises, rather they were doing what comes natural; trying to save real wealth by buying it. Even if they were buying mostly a value illusion.

======================

After 1971, the entire dollar system was too far down the debt road to change step; that is to allow all forms of real things to fluctuate up and down in dollar value. This would have required gold to rise into several thousands, even then! They were still trying to maintain dollar value for the viability of expanding dollar debt and that meant changing was not an option; especially for a system built on debt that required the illusion of a stable gold price. Still, the nature of fiat use was changing the world over and would have grave consequences for our entire dollar support system years later.

========

Contrary to Western thought, our use of money has not changed since time began. It's true that "Gold is the only money the world has ever known"; as long as one accepts that barter is the only trade the world has ever known. In the context of barter, gold has been our only money. Once we stamped gold with official unit sizes, perhaps done a thousand years ago, money became an associated value used as an intermediary between uncompleted barter.

We barter goods and services, today and anytime money has been used, using a bookkeeping system of value comparisons; all done to better convey a sense of values between ourselves. All done in the confines of what we call our world economy. The use of fiat today involves half a barter trade; then keeping the currency as an associated value and hoping it doesn't lose too much of that value before we complete the other half of the transaction. This works in a high speed trading environment where fiat is not saved long term.

I'll read an item from our last talk:

"""" Fiat purpose is maintained for those that save it for later use over short terms, not long term accumulation as wealth or for spending far in the future. Real wealth is what humans save for the future and this is where our basic instincts drive us. The incredible explosion of fiat use, since it became a non wealth holding in 1971, bears this out. Fiat values, the world over, reflect only our tradable values placed on all things. """"""""""

==================

The money concept, we have recently spoke of, did not suddenly evolve! Nor did our dollars suddenly become unbacked credit items after 1971. Well before the dollar's separation from gold all money bookkeeping, and all it's forms of currency moneys, were actually credit items.

Circulating cash dollars, official metal coinage and other previous fiats, themselves thought of as a final hard payment, were never anymore than a known tradable value. A trade credit owed to you as long as one held the money unit. Even with gold backing the dollar unit, money's value was always in it's exchange for something else we wanted. Gold values behind these fiats was used to represent some fixed tradable value the money unit stood for; not to be the money unit itself.

Gold, in ancient trade, could not become the thought of money as we know it today. It was the end of a barter transaction; two pieces of gold for one cow demanded no other trade to complete the deal. The use of money back then did not entail nearly as much associated concept, it was the
use of outright barter. Today things are, indeed, different!

================

What purpose is there in understanding the descriptions and perceptions in these last few talks?

Because there is a conflict between society's basic desire to use our modern money; or "our modern concept of money as it has evolved".

First:
Our natural drive to use money, in lieu of barter, is to use a simple bookkeeping credit trading medium that keeps track of our barter. This requires our embrace of the fact that every item in our universe of wealth constantly changes in value. Even as gold changes in value; both up and down.

Second:
The unnatural convoluted drive, of many, is to use this same "money value concept" to borrow real wealth "use"; instead of borrowing the actual wealth itself to gain said "use".

This second item comes under the heading of trying to get something for nothing and is everywhere in Western Thought!

If we lend an item of real wealth, say a tractor or chair, it's future value is unimportant to the lender as long as the real item is returned. It is the "use" that is lent, not the money concept in the form of a trading value. In this process we recognize that, because the value of things change, the debt to be repaid is the item of wealth, regardless of it's higher or lower value. Only it's "use" changed hands during the lending and repayment of debt. All is well.

However, lending the value contained in our modern money concept exposes the lender to uncertain gain or loss of tradable value because it's the value that's being lent, not the actual "use". Without some way to lock down the value of money, over long periods of time, the industry of money lending (banking) fails it's purpose and risks it's profit if tradable money value falls.

This is the trend that is killing the dollar today.

It's not that price inflation may erupt; it hasn't done much in 30 years compared to the money printing volume. Our demand for more fiat has absorbed most of what we issue.

It's not that the massive dollar debts won't be paid; they will as long as it's in more cash. Payment in real wealth, such as real goods and services from our local economy, was never an option. We simply couldn't do it!

The risk is; that our money system requires dollar and debt stability for lenders and said banking system must regain that lent tradable wealth close to par. Further, the money system is backed by this debt being stable; so without said stability the currency system fails.

The contrast here is that modern fiat use trends are advancing towards flexible fiat money. Not so much flexible against other currencies; flexible against all other wealth, including gold. The more a currency can adjust to commodity and industrial use demands, the more in demand that currency reserve system will be. The immovable past structure the dollar is built upon demands it's values be defended with complete hyperinflation if necessary. Prior to EMU, there was no other reserve currency that the world could run to. Now, the dollar cannot deflate and take the rest of the world into deflation with it. The tables are turned; deflationary policy will not defend the dollar. Only inflationary policy will. Make no mistake, we are not calling for price inflation to end the dollar's reserve rein! We are calling for "inflationary policy" to dethrone it while said hyperinflation follows.

So begins and ends our long march that attempted to steady the value of modern money by firmly attaching it to the value of gold.

So ends man's march to fix the value of gold, even during short term use, while we still naturally wish it to change.

========================================

To comment on the present

The very changes needed in our money universe, today, would kill dollar demand by devaluing all dollar assets in super higher gold prices. The debts and the dollars would remain; only 90% of their current illusion of value would vanish. Hyperinflation in prices of all wealth objects will be the workout result of this process. As such, opposing dollar political motive will force the US to give the markets what is needed; both gold and gold prices beyond imagination.

As has been mentioned by others in several public meetings;
"The world is in the midst of what could well go down in history as the first recession of this modern era of globalization".

We must point out that this is lacking some breath of perspective: in reality this will be a dollar based recession and one that the world will repulse from by advancing the use of a more flexible currency unit; the Euro. A unit that will match modern needs for fiat by marking the value of all debts as they change; by allowing a free market in gold wealth to exist outside the "money concept".

=====================

The captains of oil have not seen all of this in a vacuum. Selling irreplaceable oil for a currency entering the end of it's trend was not an option. Gold prices were lowered in exchange for a short term wait; to see if Europe could do what was intended. They did.

The next step will be an orderly exit from dollar use; a somewhat destruction of all dollar gold pricing; and a super price inflation for US dollar assets. We are not at the end my friends, we have just come to the beginning. For physical gold advocates that understand the difference between real wealth and leveraged real wealth, the time arrives when values are reflected with the speed of the wind. Truly, in our time,

"The Wind Will Blow".

At our next talk, we will move completely away from concept and into current events.
Titled "Political Gold - how much of it is ours"

Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you so much for listening tonight. I look forward to our next meeting.
Good day!
================================


Thanks all,
still hiking the path

Political Gold

Hello All!
Looks like I'm here tonight to escort everyone to their seats,,,,,,,,the guest speaker will be here in a min.,,,,,, Uhhh??,,,,, could I see your tickets please?
All right, it's starting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

============================================================

Good day to all our guests and thank you for arriving early. Our talks are an ongoing progression on the subject; the evolving message of gold. We will begin now.

=============
Starting off, I'll read an item or two from the TailGuide series: A Tree In the Making. Please read again this portion of his series for clarity.

"""" But, greatness is within those that know life is dynamic,,,,, what we do is never certain and subject to the leadership of nature. That person will spin the Bonsai on a table for hours, days, and even years as he styles what will work for that period of growth,,,, perhaps planning the timeline in a currencies development. A cut here,,,,, a change there as time grows the next limb. In the processcreating something we all recognize, can use, understand and enjoy,,,,, yet,,,, different in many ways from what we knew or saw before. """""" -----

""""""Understanding the events that got us here and how they will unfold before us is what this Gold Trail is all about. Everyday our political world is pruned like two Bonsai, in an effort to shape a more healthy future. The dollar tree is failing because it needs so much dead wood cut off,,,,,, but if it is pruned it will not resemble the mighty Bonsai it once was! The Euro tree is growing as it is being styled,,,,,, what it will look like we have an idea,,,, but not a complete picture. It's hard to imagine that anyone can look at an early Bonsai and shape it's future some 20 years out? But, that is exactly what someone did with a tree on the roof of the Monkey Bar in Hawaii; indeed, this is what has been in process for so long with our changing money system.""""""""""

======================

My friends:
We are, today, at the very conclusion of a fiat architecture that is straining to cope with our changing world. Neither the American currency dollar, it's world reserve monetary system or the native US structural economy it all currently represents will, in the near future, look anything as it presently does. Trained from birth, as all Western thinkers are, to read everything economic in dollar system terms; we, too, are all straining to understand the seemingly unexplainable dynamics that surround us today.

Western governments, the public and several schools of economic thought are attempting to define and explain what extent these changes will have within our financial and economic world. Most are all striving to see this as the next plateau of dollar integration, carrying us onto the next level; looking always higher for what this next level will bring in social, financial and lifestyle enhancements.

Governments look for a correct policy mix; one that will serve their political motive when the next cycle moves higher. The public looks for the next great investment or industry to be employed in; to enhance their well-being all the further. Economic schools, as represented by both the financial industry and the academic areas, all want "their take" on the next cycle to be seen as the correct one.

After all, this is just one more in a long line of up and down economic cycles that are so common in American economic leadership.

However, all of this positioning has left out, this time, one important, almost unthinkable question; what if current trends are moving away from using our dollar reserve system? Even further, let's ask; what if the last decade's efforts to prolong dollar use, both internally and worldwide, have inflated it's worth to such an extent that it's now vastly overvalued? Asking more; what if the architects of a competing currency system and the major players that helped guide it's internal construction, all took a hand in promoting the dollar's extended life, it's overvaluation and it's use; so as to buy time for this great transition in our money world?

================================

Most average Western Citizens and dollar use nations have pined everything on this ongoing dollar system. Their jobs, debts, investments, retirement and lifestyle expectations all depend on the dollar always being what it is; a world reserve money that buys them more than one can create during a lifetime. As true as that thought is, few understand the implication or even want to consider their life without a supreme dollar. But, just as a large portion of world inhabitants are accustomed to using more than one currency; those of Western Thought would have trouble grasping the perception behind this simple offering:

------ I once walked across the globe and brought two persons together. I gave each $1,000 US dollars in cash. The first replied; "You can't be serious? Is this as good as it gets?" The second replied; "Oh my, thank you! In all my years of life I never knew it could be this good!"------

One reply is the product of a life with unquestioned debt availability. Where the majority of debt users cover their burden with an ever growing supply of new credit money. In this economy, not to mention this person's perception, almost free debt can purchase anything and everything.

The other is the result of local money debt being built upon foreign dollar debt reserves and covered with payments of real wealth from the sweat of one's brow.

===============================

Within this theater of thought, we can begin to picture how Western perceptions cannot grasp our on going curve on the money road; much less a twist in the Gold Trail! Follow with me, if you will, as we expand some thoughts from TrailGuide's last talk, a few days ago.

"""""" As our modern society has evolved, we currently use fiat and own wealth in a way that demonstrates exactly where both values stand within our lifestyles. ---------- In hindsight, they were spending it; not to escape future run-a-way price rises, rather they were doing what comes natural; trying to save real wealth by buying it. Even if they were buying mostly a value illusion.""""

The purpose of this portion was, I believe, to deliver food for thought. The conflict, for investors and thinkers to discern, was in the evolution of fiat dollar use. While practically every historical evidence pointed to a devaluation of the dollar, within US border use, dollar use demand expanded along side of very little price inflationary pressures. Still, even with years of low inflation numbers, a cause that traditionally drove money into long term savers pockets, investors rushed to seek their perception of real wealth. Fulfilling an ages old drive to own "something" for the long term. As the final conclusion, partially phrased above, pointed out; most everyone tends "to read everything economic in dollar terms"; even buying into paper dollar versions of a value illusion. To this end, Americans have continued to save for serious consequences by buying every kind of dollar dependent real asset they can; stocks, business, debt, farms, industrial metals production, etc. and expecting it all to act as real wealth. Some of it will, most of it will not!

Further on from "The Wind Will Blow":

""""" After 1971, the entire dollar system was too far down the debt road -------- the nature of fiat use was changing the world over and would have grave consequences for our entire dollar support system years later."""""""""""""""

Having evolved a dollar reserve money system into a straight debt fiat currency, without gold involvement, the entire dollar function became locked into one basic premise: for the system to survive, it's core reserves of debt values had to remain somewhat price stable as the currency inflated relative to GDP. Over the next 30+ years their dollar controllers, the fed and treasury, thought they had a fairly good handle on the system as they managed banking reserve requirements. To their amazement, it turns out today, that digital use demand was the best function that supported their efforts all the while; by increasing the world's use and need for currency. Had they understood this modern economic function early on, they could have somewhat printed the currency outright with almost the same result while arriving at today's destination. They could have let gold float, not to mention they could have skipped a large portion of the debt build up that will now end the
dollars timeline.

Most, if not all, of this perspective is only now coming to light as the Euro builds pressure on the dollar. The better architecture of the Euro system is leaving little room to adjust as the US fed must singularly act to inflate their local currency in a historically new and unprecedented fashion. The actual debt machine that built much of America's lifestyle is now going into reverse as it destroys it's own currency; one built upon a stable debt system with locked down gold prices.

Going further and paraphrasing what TrailGuide writes:

"""""""It's not that price inflation may erupt --------- ------------It's not that the massive dollar debts won't
be paid---------The risk is; that our money system requires dollar (goods prices) and debt stability -------- so without said stability the currency system fails""""""""""""

Without an international floating gold reserve pricing, to balance against their devaluing debt reserve, the entire dollar banking system can only rely upon extreme dollar inflation to float it's accounts. Price inflation will have to be ignored. To this end the group of dollar supporting countries, we refer to as the dollar faction, has locked itself into a box. It must find a way to float gold prices with a gold reserve that only drains away if world gold price rise.

===================
Current events
===================

There once was a time when citizens owned their trading vehicles; all wealth, including gold, was free to barber. Then ruling authorities stamped most of those gold trading vehicles as "legal tender" and made them money objects; dependent upon value associations instead of barter. No doubt to collect taxes as running nations was a costly affair.

Extending the point:

Around 1975 Americans were given the legal right to own gold again. Many did not then, nor do they today, see any reason to own gold as their treasury has gold with which to back their currency. The logic of this perception is clear and simple to the casual observer. However, take out one US legal tender dollar and read it's cover carefully? Does it say it is your currency? Is your name on it?

The US dollar is a note, a security that specifies a value the holder is owed. You may keep it or spend it or even trade it, but it does not belong to you. It belongs to the US Treasury and is created by the Federal Reserve; both political entities. What a person owns, when holding a dollar, is the value that note is tradable for; the value that is owed to you and said dollar note represents. In
every way it is real money; in that it's value is in it's tradable value association; not of itself. If the dollar itself had real value, it's use would constitute barter; not the use of TrailGuide's money concept.

If you think you own the currency of this country, understand this one item: the political entity that the dollar is owned by, can cancel it's legal tender status at any time. There by removing your use of it's holdings!

Extending further:

The only gold Americans ever owned, prior to 1933, was the very gold coins they carried. They owned it because it was a true barter vehicle. Even if the Treasury removed it's legal tender, "money aspect", from said gold coins, you could still barter the value contained in the gold. By 1971, Americans owned no gold and all gold held in the name of the US Treasury was "Political Gold" owned by the government.

The perception, by some, that because the government owned the gold, the citizens own it too. This flows from a similar convoluted logic; that stock holders of publicly traded gold mines own the underground gold. In reality, if the mine was dissolved, both processed and reserve gold would be sold and "Legal Tender" money would be distributed to it's owners. Not gold.

The same is true for Political Gold. All gold held by the state, unless distributed first to it's citizens, is subject to world wide "Legal Tender" political claims first. The precedent for this is clearly revealed as the Swiss must ship their "Political Gold" to others first; while sending currency to satisfy gold claims against it.

As the IMF has recently extended this protocol, swapping gold at different values, to settle political debts; this action further justifies the US being able to use it's gold to defend it's currency's settlement function. Aside from the US minting eagles for public sale and it being against the law for gold reserves to be sold outright to open bidders.

==================

To draw a conclusion from this "current event":
Deep Storage gold

Americans have the right to buy and own the "Wealth Of Ages". As events draw to a close upon dollar use, we can expect outright use of America's "Political Gold" in restraining the speed of it's currency's burn. To compete in the new architecture of a Euro System currency, unrestrained trading of gold will advance it's dollar and Euro price significantly. With political pressures to tax private physical gold trading as low as possible, expect enormous taxing and windfall profits rules to impact all other forms of gold ownership. Indeed, long before such changes are in place investors will rush to be in the correct ownership place, well ahead of the fact.

Of Fiats and Gold:

It is ironic that both roads have curved as time moved on. One returns to it's roots, as a wealth value today, few have ever know. The other becomes the money a modern future requires. Both on a different path and building for our better future.

Next time I will discuss; what one should realy expect to see when all paper burns; and how close political events are saying we are to that fire!

Thank you for taking the time to come here and listen to these talks. I wish you well and good night.

=======================================

Ok, everyone please leave the Trail as you found it,,,,,, no trash or drinks. (smile) We will meet here for his next talk when it comes. I'll comment in between.

Thanks

Walking On Solid Ground

Walking On Solid Ground: Hiking the Gold Trail

Ok! We have quite a crowd here,,,,,,, this morning. This must be an overflow from our recent Talks Series. There are more of those scheduled next time; but today we will go for a hike. As many of you already know, and some newer visitors are finding out, there is a price to be paid to hear mine and others Thoughts. Yes, you have to use your legs and mind, because most of the gain here comes over time and distance. If one want's the whole story you will have to walk with us and watch it unfold. Out here, there is no waiting at the Trail Head for someone to return with a complete report. The understanding is found within yourself, while completing the trip, not just at the end.(smile) I'll speak loudly so those in the back can hear. Packs on,,,, keep up, now! Let's hit the trail!

====================================

It's a clear day, today, and easy to see how the world is changing. Once we thought that everything in the name of "dollar money" was an anchor of financial stability while our organic planet changed; we now know that even our money systems have seasons, too. Watching evolving events with a Physical Gold Advocate based perspective, over this last decade, demonstrates this perfectly. Indeed, from here on out our world now has two major fiats and their competition is going to prove that anchors do not hold because they are attached to the weight of gold; rather money is made
stable by moving it's value with gold.

Look to the left

The gold perspective, most people have employed, is little more than a shadow of what the political gold world, in it's immensity, is all about. Shallow Western perspectives and their view of gold, being just it's dollar price, proved over and over how dangerous such a narrow thought can be to one's wealth. Making the object of one's gains to be "the inflating denominator of wealth", fiat money, instead of "the real wealth itself", gold; leaves us at the mercy of any political money evolution! When seasons change, as gold trail hikers know they always do, the risk becomes the "question" so many gold bugs have grappled with this last decade; can my investment in the price of gold keep up with and purchase an equal value of physical gold itself? For most, it has not, as paper leverage hacked away at their wealth held in paper gold assets! The future may be even less kind!

An investment in the gold industry, not just mining, can be nothing more than an investment in a business that balances fiat production cost against fiat market prices for it's product; gold. The return, if any, is always in fiat and places this portion of one's wealth smack on the tracks of more political manipulation. Today, we can see this play out all over the world as fiat returns in the gold business head towards and even sink below zero. The investor watches this fiat illusion of his net worth drain away while the opportunity to build a real wealth of "bullion ownership" escapes yet again.

Playing the various paper gold investment games is no different. When the time comes, when the dollar season really changes, dollar denominated paper gold bets will do well if they can just break even. The real wealth owner will stand aside this burning of paper and watch his coins and bullion explode hundreds of percent ahead of any fiat paper gains. This is what the real world of a gold advocate is all about.

=====================

Onward the trail,,,,,, look off towards the end

I, myself, own gold for one purpose; to save a real wealth that's in addition to all the other things I own. I save it this way because it outmaneuvers, sidetracks and escapes all political money evolution. It does this in such a way that I will later have the same relative amount of real wealth for my future needs. Or, in the very worst case, have close to the same as I have today. Still, the upshot of this is an additional aspect that is good for me and bad for so many players trying to leverage gold. Pause and see this:

-----The very political motive that is moving our world away from dollars has, for some time, changed the dynamics of straight bullion values. In the long 20 or 30 year process of evolving our currency world, the time span required to do the job has rendered gold far below it's worth; "relative" to all other things. When the seasons change, as mentioned before, bullion will first have to find it's true "free from money involvement" price in the world. From that point it will return to do it's best job of marking the historic process of falling currency values; unproductive political currency inflation. It will do this so well because physical gold will return to it's roots. It will again be recognized as the best,,,,, "lowest taxed",,,,,,"barter wealth",,,,, the world has even known! Low gains taxes will not allow it to replace digital money; as will it's inability to duplicate fiat's efficiency.

Rather gold will accentuate fiat use by becoming a real wealth reserve that compares fiats against each other thru a single arms length medium. Unable to control this gold medium, because it is no longer money and subject to credit entanglements, national fiats will resort to competing against each other. The free markets as we have always wanted them! First worlds, third worlds, all worlds; trading for what they can do, not what they can control.------

Back walking again

During this short and slight moment in time, a decade of years in the making by our human measurement, physical gold has become an investment of a lifetime to persons like myself. A wealth of ages that will not only transport my savings forward, during fiat evolution, but will increase my total wealth many times over. From there it will defend that value against all comers; all fiat price inflations!

This is the opportunity paper traders forsake as they bet on a train that's running away from them.

====================

Further we walk

I have tried to point out that the gold concept today is not one of just matching dollar price inflation in the future. If that was all we owned gold for, one could have covered that with several stock market games years ago. If $500, $700 or $800 was the goal, it becomes just another commodity bet and there have been plenty of other leveraged "plays" that already beat that. No, buying gold today is a political move; one that will add political sized returns to this gold advocate's wealth.

For this reason we outline the political "fiat against fiat money nature" of the battle more so that the gold to money battle. In the future, for any currency to compete against the Euro, native gold markets will have to trade at least in equilibrium with a Euro based free gold price. This will further pressure "political money posturing" to relinquish all fixed gold relationships with their moneys; fixed legal tender gold coinage included. This could become a very convoluted affair for gold coin investors. Especially if Euroland eventually mints a free floating gold coin; not dissimilar to the K- Rand! Not to be confused with Robert Ms 100 Euro or Germany's new offering; perhaps it will be
called the "Euroland" gold coin? In fact, I bet it will (smile).

Coming to a nice clearing

While I am not unloading any of my various Eagles, maples, etc.,,,,,,,,, I want my involvement with gold to be as free of fiat involvement as possible. As an extension to this, all out of circulation, old gold coins make an excellent contribution to this thought. A powerful thinker once said that old gold coins will one day be treasured as forms of antiques in addition to their gold values. Few enough in circulation to carry extra value, but not rare enough to dissuade one from selling or trading them in the future.

To this end that same gentleman made a statement that embellishes the entire trail of Thought we walk today. It inspires countless large and small private gold advocates with a warning for a future we must prepare for and a call to stand guard!

I'll say the words again to end our hike.
--------
"when a thousand hungry lions fight over one scrap of food, small dogs should hide with what's in their belly"

"we watch this new gold market together, yes?"
-------

The sun is going down and it's time to camp here for the next speaker. Something about burning paper; I won't want to skip that one. Thank you each and every one for walking with me on this very fine day (smile).

Huff. . . .puff. . . .huff. ... .puff
Hello, FOA. I've been climbing all day, and just when I think, I'm not going to quite catch up, I round the bend back there and see you sitting on that rock just beaming at me. It is good to see you, my friend. Good to meet you here on the Trail.

I want to mention before all else that this hike we are on now -- The Message of an Evolving Market -- is nothing short of phenomenal, and would like to take this opportunity to ask your permission to use a portion of it in the upcoming News & Views. We've decided to go to a larger quarterly publication to augment all that's going on here at USAGOLD. You might be interested to know that Randy just informed me by e-mail that just today he has registered several new posters including "gold-hearts" from Germany, Paraguay and Sweden. Now if we can just get them to post! It used to be that investors would call and say that they were inspired to act on the basis of something they read in the newsletter. More and more, their interest is piqued by something said or published at USAGOLD. So, we change with the times my friend, and this too is a message from an "Evolving Market."

Like some at the main forum, I took an interest in the Legal Tender discussion from the Political Gold post and, it is something you said in that essay, that brought me over here for my first post.

This I find very interesting:

". . .All gold held by the state, unless distributed first to it's citizens, is subject to world wide "Legal Tender" political claims first. The precedent for this is clearly revealed as the Swiss must ship their "Political Gold" to others first; while sending currency to satisfy gold claims against it.

As the IMF has recently extended this protocol, swapping gold at different values, to settle political debts; this action further justifies the US being able to use it's gold to defend it's currency's settlement function. Aside from the US minting eagles for public sale and it being against the law for gold reserves to be sold outright to open bidders."

This idea of a gold drain from the U.S. to those countries holding copious amounts of U.S. Treasury paper, as a form of settlement, is something I, like you, see as a consequence of a potential post-1971 U.S. dollar order breakdown. You are quite right to imply that gold mobilizations are often related to settlement issues including currency breakdowns and possibly even gold carry trade settlements (wherein the central bank acts as a gold lender of last resort). For the press and some economists to underplay the role of gold in international settlements is to throw a cover over the truth and maintain the fiction that gold's role is secondary, when it is not. It is in fact primary and the cases just in the last decade are legion. The Argentine treasury for example is devoid of gold. So is Brazil's. So are a dozen other countries which have experienced currency problems. (Leaving aside for a moment, all the hapless third world countries who have entrusted their gold to the gold carry trade.) In Q1, 1998 S. Korea -- a country that uses 25 tonnes of gold a quarter -- exported 250 tonnes of gold in defense of its currency! The sure route to rebuilding a currency is to somehow associate it with gold. So we have Russia and the Chevronet, the Islamic Dinar movement, and gold reserves in the ECB.

Along these lines, I think I probably speak for many when I say I am intrigued by your statements about a future U.S. gold mobilization in defense of the dollar. Somehow I think there's a great deal more to your thinking than what is contained in that paragraph.

I guess my major question has to do with the settlement price in such a situation. At the current price, I think the 8000 tonne U.S. Treasury hoard would be sitting in Brussels, Tokyo and Beijing within 30 days of the mobilization's announcement. With something like $6 trillion floating around the globe, few would dismess that concern. Could you give us some details on your thinking?

Well, I need to get back down the mountain, FOA. It's getting close to dinner time and that cloud rolling over that mountain to the West looks like it might spell trouble.

Good to be here, good sir. I always enjoy these discussions. MK

Marker on the trail: Does the game begin?
http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,5-2001243118,00.html

Hello all

While work is in progress to reply to MKs question; I thought a few markers on the trail, from time to time would be helpful.

From The Times WEDNESDAY JULY 18 2001 (see link above)


Misery deepens for US high-tech industry
BY LEA PATERSON, ECONOMICS EDITOR

-----A SHARP contraction in US manufacturing has pushed American industry into its longest uninterrupted period of decline for almost 20 years, figures revealed yesterday. -----------

------industrial output dropped a larger than expected 0.7 per cent in June. This was the ninth month of contraction, the longest unbroken period of decline since 1982.------------

--------- Capacity utilization fell to a 18-year low of 77 per cent. -----------

-------- "Another sharp decline in output confirms the damaging impact of a strong dollar, excessive inventories and weakening sales," Matthew Wickens, at ABN Amro, said. -----------


==========================

Unlike past periods, when America rolled over the top of another economic cycle, this fall away should begin to develop into a permanent downhill slide! Never before in our post 1971 financial cycles have we defended the dollar against a reserve rival while trying to adjust world financial policy during a building recession.

This time the world may slow somewhat as we fall away; however, they will not have to follow us into an inflationary money policy that floats all ships in the same reserve currency ocean. America is, for the first time, about to experience the impact of such an arrangement.

As the "strong dollar" gives way, the effects mentioned above by Mr. Wickens, will fold over time and again in a historically new inflationary trend the likes of we have never seen. Each time our output declines the resulting "excessive inventories and weakening sales" will not overcome the effects of ever rising prices.

Just as our dollar's exchange rate falls, placing us in a better competitive position, localized price inflation will mute that effect. One again producing the calls for lowering "the too strong dollar" from that level. Over and over the game will cycle; producing a kind of inflation we have never known! A kind of price inflation that cannot be overcome with "typical accepted" inflation investments of the
past.

This time, investing in "the industry" or "business" that produces inflation hedging investments will not work enough to do the hedging job. From oil companies to coal companies,,,,,,,, home builders to lumber producers,,,,,,, carpet makers to gold miners: costs will outrun their ability to create an after tax profit.

Even leveraged games of paper will fall victim to political moves; aimed to protect local currency use.

The world is changing and we are on the right "Trail" to understand it all. The "burning of paper" wealth is coming and one of our future talks here will describe it all so well!

Thanks TrailGuide

Gold Mobilization

Hello again MK!

Glad you could meet me here in Denver and share this next presentation. We can talk a bit before things get started. Yes, it was very good to have seen you up there, on the trail, and thanks for complimenting the first parts of this "message". MK, you also presented a question to me that I'm sure was rhetorical: permission to use some of these works in News & Views?

Oh my! You build a forum rock for Gold Advocates to stand on and present their case from; then you ask such a question???

Sir, you are the epitome of what gracious courtesy strives to become! Yes, please do use even the smallest portion of offerings as you desire and do feel free to disagree with any point in them. (smile)

Michael, the reason for our city meeting, today, was so we can step behind this closed door and listen in on a discussion there. It's in progress and we are suppose to be here, so let's go in now.

===================================================

Hello to everyone that just arrived.

In this talk we are shifting the schedule a bit to delve into a political money issue: as the question was presented by Mr. Kosares earlier. He is the gentleman that's just entered and is standing to our left. Not only is he also an educator of gold issues, to the public at large, he is also a keen observer of human dynamics in the political sense. So, this particular area of thought was the attraction for his being here. It's a privilege and honor to have him sit in on our discussion.

===================

To start off:
Someone once asked me if all of our thoughts were on the level? Well, at a young age I often thought there was difference between fact and opinion; then I learned that everything spoken was opinion and anything written was fact! A few years later, someone told me that anything spoken is not true and all things written is opinion! Last year I was told that everything is an opinion and nothing is true! Ha! Ha! So, today, I state for the record that all of our Thoughts are Absolute fact!(smile)

====================================

We are asked to expand our thoughts pertaining to "a future U.S. gold mobilization in defense of the dollar" and elaborate on what "the settlement price in such a situation" could be? These truly are exceptional, thought provoking questions, and will require an equally dynamic explanation. I'm assuming most or all of you were at all of these "message" talks and have our past, long running, basis of context in mind. To understand our position, one has to grasp how position we came to know it.
We begin.

=======================================

I am sure most Americans are uncomfortable at the prospect of our stores of Political Gold being shipped off to defend the dollar. Uncomfortable as this may be, unprecedented it is not. During most of the years of an active Gold Exchange Standard gold was routinely "shipped off" from nation to nation to satisfy foreign demands. Not just entirely to defend our dollar's value; the aim of these operations was, then and now, more so to keep the dollar in settlement use.

Yes, the dollar's continued use for trade settlement and the defense of that valued use was always the aim of these gold trades; but even below this is a deeper meaning to this function.

========================================

From a dollar point of view, shipping gold then, and now, was in the same context of defending one's currency on the exchange market. In the context of this use; gold was not sold as a commodity, rather it is clearly traded as an officially earmarked "good" that can further support the "tender status" of internationally held dollars.

The psychology of "gold exchange" is more manifest in our "legal tender" function than most strive to understand. Standing aside, for a moment, from our previous discussions concerning modern fiat demand's impact on the dollars recent value; we look more closely at the logic of this "tender"
function.

============================

Local dollar currency, circulating within US borders, is given political value because of it's legal tender designation. Dollars outside our domain, while often sharing the same trading value, are not covered by that law. Even though, through protocol they are commonly accepted, they are not legal tradable money; unless they re-enter the US again.

The process of defending the dollar by shipping gold is, today as much as yesterday, an expression of maintaining political "Legal Tender" status for international clientele. Indeed, as an ongoing trade deficit in the US has become irreversibly structural to the integrity of the local economy and remained in this function for many years; the legal tender function of foreign dollar reserves comes very much into question. It begs this suggestion: does the international dollar have any internal political force backing it's value overseas? This question can only be addressed by shipping gold in a legal "currency defending" process.

============================

During most of the "gold exchange standard" period our dollars were nothing less than contracts for gold in storage. As we all know, to defend such a non expiring gold contract nature, as the dollar was held then, one must sometimes perform as the note is written; and gold on demand was said performance. Indeed, the circulation, use and retention of international "dollars in reserve" was built upon both; it's old gold deed form, that could be traded for gold, and it's use as a viable "legal tender" vehicle, to buy local US goods.

Over the last decade or so, with both it's gold deed function and "legal tender" function blocked by political motive and structural economic forces; the currency can and must be defended through other means. Further, our international dollar has degenerated away from being even basic "money"; to being little more than an international derivative of derivatives; that represents currency swaps, gold loans, uncollectable foreign debts and still more gold swaps. In this end stage of failure, our external dollar arena must eventually be defended with performance, if demanded; if it's use and credibility as an international settlement medium is to continue. With the US now clearly proceeding into a recession, and doing so with the competition of another reserve currency for the first time, local price inflation will prove irresistible in undermining international dollar exchange values.

If foreign political motive decides to no longer support international dollar denominated gold derivatives with physical delivery or refrain from using gold as a trade settlement; the US will have to choose between shipping it's gold or seeing all international dollar structure and use fail! In it's place, Euro system currency would easily become the main reserve as soaring gold values would
replace "tender" value lost from dollar failure.

We think that: given ongoing lifestyle enhancements afforded to US citizens from the current dollar's value as a reserve currency; the loss of this standard is of greater importance than the loss of gold! Local political motive will answer this foreign dollar value challenge by using gold as somewhat of a bribe for letting the air out of the dollar slowly. The result will be a massive dollar price rise in gold that performs over several years; as the reserve function transition politically begins.

The nature of the current dollar based gold market, outside US borders, is perhaps leveraged 1,000+ to one and will require ever greater physical gold shipments, at ever higher values, to maintain dollar credibility. This failure process will draw US gold stores out in the form of "currency defense"; not as gold sales aimed at keeping the price down. A purely legal defense use of politically owned gold.

Still, gold shipments will always be far behind the price curve and only be done as last resort crisis operations. Further, the rise will be so intense as to provoke a complete cessation of all derivative gold trading within US borders. Long before this occurs traders, both foreign and local, will bail out of our gold derivative markets even as physical prices rise. A spot physical gold market will be all that remains. Something local citizens will cherish and paper brokers will deplore!

===================================

To date, these gold shipments have been ongoing but have not, yet, involved original US political owned gold. The bullion involved has been metal subjugated from foreign third world countries through dollar for gold swaps; executed thru US currency protocols. Mr. Kosares is correct in observing how foreign gold is drained from these nation in trade for debt relief and crisis support. In classic form, we will be the next in line to be "swapped out" also!

I expect that "our" crisis will begin by year end as the Euro foundation becomes complete in the issuance of real currency. The new designation of our gold reserves is a classic signal that a major crisis is coming. A suspicion will eventually arise that native US money growth, now approaching 20%, will accelerate in hyper form to save it's banking function and political gold stores will not be
available to redenominate the currency. The very thought of a loss of reserve status for the dollar is on everyone's minds and will soon break out into open currency warfare. By then; the Washington Agreement's restrictions of bullion supplies will begin to bite as players demand gold and rush from the failure of contract credibility. By then: it will become known that the only way to stay whole, without bullion relief, will be in aligning one's self within the Euro Zone of financing. Those that started early in resolving some of their political gold debts will be the first to receive backing. England? Swiss? The rush will be on!

How far will gold rise? At first blush, foreign dollar assets will not, in any way, return home! They will circulate offshore; either from lack of understanding of the issues, a thought that things will be worked out or from foreign exchange controls aimed at protecting the failing US economy!

These reserves will circulate until their gross exchange value simulates a figure that can be reasonably expected to "buy something" within the US; ten cents on the dollar could be a guess? However, keep in mind that the fed will be printing like mad, local prices will be soaring and no one will be chasing dollars like they do today. I expect that physical gold trading, within the US, will follow far behind foreign trading for a time. Perhaps a $5,000 to $15,000 ratio will be a thought as dollars within the US will be worth more than outside. Still, the relative value of physical gold will eventually converge as a trading standard is reached.

Keep in mind that there could be a gap between physical prices, reflecting reality, and futures prices crashing. The Western gold world looks to the current paper gold price as the value for bullion; even though it is but an illusion. A market trading 90% derivatives and 10% physical cannot, in any stretch of the imagination, produce a gold price relative to real things.

===========================================================
Our understanding


For years academia has gone round and round about how the US illegally went off the "gold-is-money" standard. Well, I know that and so too has most every hard money person has delved into this area. All of those days are never going to be reworked to change history; so why waste our time on a wrong that's not going to be brought to justice today? Well, we can look at some of those particular points so as to find clues for a better context concerning our subject.

As you know we have discussed, at length, how gold is not money; rather it is the very best form of physical wealth barter the world has ever known. We also separated money from gold by defining money as a "retained value thought"; a thought that exists between both sides of a barter transaction as an "associated tradable value". In this, the fiat dollars we know and use today; represent today modern money in the very best of this money context.

The result of such thinking draws a conclusion that fits perfectly into our fast paced world. Fiat currency, unbacked except by it's legal tender statutes, is a fine immediate trading medium for short term buying and selling. It's best saved for short term use, only, and spent to buy any and all forms of real wealth. Of course, if it's printing production extremely outpaces even basic GDP, it's use value eventually falls.

The problem for our dollar is that it has entered into this modern "single use" fiat world, as a currency promoted as "real wealth saved"; and the use of gold, as a parallel long term savings vehicle, is dismissed and cloaked in an illusion of price. No fiat can serve it's modern function while becoming entangled between these opposite forces of use; a wealth for saving and a money for trade.

Many times officials have tried to mitigate this cross function failure by storing gold in government control and printing fiat in a straight ratio to gold owned. Hopping to keep gold values static so as to retain fiat values and keeping a fractional reserve banking system viable and expanding; while having said stable fiat values stabilize it's debt that's held as a reserve. In the real world this cannot function as all prices and values are dynamic. Including gold and all forms of money!

Further, we hire auditors to count the gold and the money to make sure they match. Counting the gold is easy, but counting fiat, in it's endless credit functions and derivatives, time and again proves an impossible affair. Eventually the stores of official gold must have their value "controlled" thru fiat credit entanglements; all for some ridiculous balancing act.

It is, and will be, far better to just hire auditors to do the best they can to count fiat issuance as an independent function. Then, allowing gold wealth ownership to return to the public and freely trade outside it's old official money and credit entangled realm. There, gold can be used to "tender" in the form of real purchasing power; as the real wealth trading item it always was.

======================

Concerning this subject; we find collaborating evidence to this chain of thought from the fathers of our constitution. Note that they do not mention gold and silver in the context of money! Few hard money people or historians have thought seriously about the context of this wording, or how the minds of that era were thinking. Consider the word tender as one version of the dictionary presents it:

Middle French; tendre to stretch, stretch out, offer ------ also --------- to present for acceptance.

----Article I, Section 10 of our Constitution says, "No state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts."-----------

Clearly, even then, gold was connected in thought with being something one "stretched out" and presented for acceptance. These are common perceptions from a time when much of what one brought and sold came to them through barter. Even though these early colonies were closer in time to our modern use of money associations; their lives were still very much in an era where, perhaps, 50% of trade was still outright barter!

Truly, in their perceptions gold and silver was a "good (tender) in the settlement (payment) of trade (debts)" and no state should make anything else to function in that context. But what about something outside this context? A medium of trade different from bartering gold wealth for goods?

-----Would American fiat money one day be issued as a "medium" in trade, more so than using gold as a "tender" in barter? ---------------

=====================

The common use of fiat currency is and was a natural evolution into using "money", in it's pure associated value form, as a medium for the trade of goods; far removed from using gold in a "real good barter" context as a "tender in the (final) payment (settlement) of trade (debt).

American money law may have been desecrated over and over again; however, nothing in our original thinking precludes us from designating "the money concept" as a "legal tender" in trade along side gold or silver as a "tender" in trade.

In reworking the definition of "note" as it appears on our currency, perhaps it is the money our system never had time to allow it to become. In another time and another place, fiat will be know as:

-a written promise to trade at a determinable value a variable sum of other goods to the bearer--

The difference between use function and value function, of our money, was most surely convoluted for political gain and banking credit interest. Truly, American history has shown we did a terrible job of rendering this ages old gold barter function useless in a modern world. Mostly because of our complete lack of money vs. barter understanding. Today, we enter the "end time" thrashing of such a currency experiment.

Thank you for attending and I thank Mr. Kosares for his presence here. Sir, please drop in at any time.

=============================================

Back on the trail again to watch it all unfold! (smile)

Hello all!

Thought I would ramble a bit while we walk this 1/4 mile circle in my back yard,,,,,, here on the trail. Only a few here today,,,,,, so we can talk quietly .

Couldn't help but notice that MK posted some of his fine points from ABCs of gold! I saw it while attending that discussion, yesterday, in Denver (smile). You know, for people that lead a hectic life, that book is all one needs to understand the meanings of gold. Just do as the thrust of the text implores; put yourself on your own gold standard and save some of your wealth in gold. After reading all of it, it's a real simple concept grasp. Don't put off the necessary things required in your daily life so as to buy more gold; that just puts you in the same category as most sweating goldbugs! Saving gold, over the long run, will allow one to enjoy the wealth when it truly does appear. This, perhaps, was the centerpiece of Another's thrust, so long ago: just buy gold as you are able and as the understanding comes! Perhaps that just proves that the ancients were smarter than we are today; they owned gold and didn't need to hear all the politics.

Yes, I have had a copy of the ABCs for some time (smile). Only, I had to go through all kinds of antics to acquire it. You know,,,, CPMs private club of clientele gets all this stuff real easy, while guys like me have to pay a small fortune for it on the black market! But well worth the cost. (huge grin) Wait a min.,,,,,,,, I'll pull a copy out from my backpack. I'm only doing this because we are few here today,,,,,, I'd get thrown off the trail if anybody finds out.

I like the part on page 69:

---------- The American political process today is characterized by the politics of debt -------

Well, here,,,,, pass it around so you can read it.
Good stuff!

You know,,,,,,,

I think far too many people try to think of gold as an investment instead of an asset. Aside from modern financial doublespeak, with brokers of every kind and nature trying to sell us leverage,,,,,, the old world ideals of real property and ownership imparted a much more stable meaning to the term, "asset", than we place on it today. In Old French; assez ------ enough------ implied a holding that was appropriate. Or Latin (1531); ad to ,,,,,,,,,,, implying a build up of things.

Truly, the return on an asset, placed into use, was a return of the value of that use. Not an increase in the value of the asset. We watch gold today and see it only as an investment that returns little. It should be seen as an asset we can acquire at a very low real value. In such times we should consider this action as an opportunity to ------"ad to" or the building up of things.

You know,,,,,,,,,,

We are all trapped in the society we came into this world with. The history of mankind is an endless record of "us" coming to terms with the the people we love,,,,,, but their politics we cannot stand! The ideals are always there to reach for but for the life of "us" our little group, in our little time frame, cannot come together to reach for the right thing. Strangely enough, within this America, there go I.

A friend once tried to insult me in a toast; referring to me as the best and smartest mutt he ever knew. Ha! Ha! I lifted my glass, in front of all, and drank with a loud gulp. Then returned the compliment; "to my family and friends, from the best dog in the pack"!

All that: from a fifth generation, typical Anglo-Saxon that was born in the "USA". I walk this land, upon which my home is owned, and tear for a future we may face. Oh the irony of it all; that one day my time will end with a pocket full of gold and left fist full of Euros,,,,,,, whist a sword drawn to defend this soil of my fathers. Against all comers,,,,,, here stand I,,,, America or nothing,,,,,, my country, my sole! To the attackers I say " these are my people,,,,, so right and so very very wrong".

You know,,,,,,,,,

The seasons change, so do I
and the better part of life is in knowing why

I'm off the check the path!

"everything to do with a gold bull market"

Hello again!

I'm just placing another "rather large marker" here on the trail for us to follow all the conflicting stories that come out; especially as all this moves into a higher gear. Note the first news item and how it reflects the paper pusher view of dollar advocates; all taken from USAGOLD NEWS FEED:

=====================

US euro futures data could spell currency trouble

-------Europe's single currency could be headed for trouble if data on U.S. futures traders' positions is any indication. Recent figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that speculators have been fortifying long positions in euro futures for almost two months, a situation some see as a contrarian sign of an imminent decline.----------

-----The Commitments of Traders report showed that speculative interest was nearly flat the week of June 12 and has steadily built up to the current long bias, analysts said. "It is a fairly bearish signal,----------------

------ But the fate of euros really hangs on the performance of the U.S. economy, since the gains in euros have been largely a factor of weak dollar fundamentals.------------

http://money.iwon.com/jsp/nw/nwdt_ge.jsp?section=news&news_id=reu-n09239372&feed=reu&date=20010809&cat=USMARKET

end
=====================

Note:

The last item above could just as easily be printed in Another format that better indicated the new financial market ahead:

------ But the fate of DOLLARs really hangs on the performance of the EURO ZONE economy, since the RECENT LOSES in DOLLARs have been largely a factor of STRONGER EURO
fundamentals.------------

Puts a different view on it doesn't? Now read a bit of reality news from today's item:

================

Dollar Falls to Three-Month Low as Extended U.S. Slowdown Seen

-------- New York, Aug. 9 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar fell to a three- month low against the euro as a report of rising U.S. jobless claims reinforced concern the world's biggest economy won't revive anytime soon. ------- Since a Federal Reserve survey yesterday showed stagnant growth the past two months, the U.S. currency has shed about three- quarters of a cent versus the euro. Today's report that more workers than expected filed claims for unemployment benefits last
week drove the U.S. currency to the day's weakest level. --------------

------- \`\`People are questioning the relative strength of the U.S. economy'' after the Fed survey ----------

----- U.S. corporations would likely welcome some further weakening in the dollar, as gains in the currency make their products less competitive overseas. General Motors Corp. Chief Financial Officer John Devine criticized the government's strong-dollar policy yesterday, telling reporters that the currency's strength -----\`is destroying the manufacturing competitiveness of this country.'' -------------

-------- The euro started trading in January 1999 at about $1.17, and since falling below $1 in February last year, it has twice failed to sustain rallies above 95 cents. ---------------

-------- Today's euro gains also came as the European Central Bank said in its August monthly report it will \`\`closely monitor'' whether interest rates are appropriate, a signal it may be preparing to lower borrowing costs as soon as this month. A rate cut may bolster expectations for
a rebound in European growth. -------------------------

http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?mnu=news&ptitle=Currency%20World&tp=ad_uknews&T=news_storypage99.ht&ad=world_currency&s=AO3KXQxWhRG9sbGFy
end

====================

Note:

Notice our General Motor's CFO's comment --------- "the (dollar's) strength is destroying the manufacturing competitiveness of this country.'' -------!!!

This should read --------"the Euro's weakness is destroying the manufacturing competitiveness of this (USA) country.''

This item of relative logic is further confounded in that the Euro is hardly week! American media, being dollar biased as it is, has used every moment to educate us to see how far the Euro has fallen. When it fact the Euro has only fluctuated in a tight band; just below a currency level that shifts "American real productivity" competitiveness toward the next largest economic block. Giving the world financial structure every reason to move into Euros to denominate and settle trade.

Consider this item: ------ The euro started trading in January 1999 at about $1.17, -----------

Using this 1.17 figure blurs our reasoning just enough to allow one and a half years to pass without anyone complaining it's fall. We are positioned to look at this process as --" oh see the poor old Euro, it can't hardly get back onto its feet". Consider that that 1.17 figure was nothing but a "nano-second" spurt, more similar to an IPO (initial public offering); relative to almost no actual
goods trading. In it's beginning setup we can see that the real range, from hindsight over a period of time, was between around 98 and 83. This is the area where the ECB/BIS wanted the new currency to occupy in its war to unseat the dollar. Yes, the Euro is only down some 10% as of today! This is not the sign of a failing reserve system of 300+ million people!

Further:

Also note the above -------- Today's euro gains also came as the European Central Bank said in its August monthly report it will \`\`closely monitor'' whether interest rates are appropriate ------

Suddenly the tide has turned and the ECB is seen as ahead of the curve while still in a non inflationary management position; relative to the dollar. Going forward everything the fed does will be seen as stroking US price inflation. Perhaps this is the reason Another said that Mr. D, of the
ECB, can and is about to leave. His hard job is done! Only to see Mr G, of the Fed, beating a hasty retreat! Truly, no one wants to reside over the transfer of our US horde of political gold as prices soar,,,, both of gold and all local goods!

Even further:

This not only has "everything to do with a gold bull market", it has everything to do with a changing world financial architecture. And I have to admit: if you hated our last one, you will no doubt hate this new one, too. However, everyone that is positioned in physical gold will carry this storm in fantastic shape. This is because the ECB has no intentions of backing their currency with gold and
every intention of using gold as a "free trading" financial reserve. None of the other metals will play a part in this.

Clearly, the coming drastic constriction in dollar financial trade will trigger a super "print press" response from the Fed. They will not be pushing on a string; rather picking up the ball of twine and throwing it! All the while using the old 1980s "monetary control act" that opens their use of
magnetizing almost anything and everything. They won't be adding reserves to the banking system in the future; rather buying any and all debts from anyone that needs fresh cash. Believe it!

For the first time,,,,,,,, our industrial production, along with the demand for industrial metals like silver, will fall away even as hyper inflation in prices takes hold.

For the first time,,,,,,,, demonstrating that no other asset is equal to gold, even though promoted to be!

When the coming paper illusion price of gold is destroyed, sending its trading price way up and way down, several times, before shutdown,,,,,,,,,,,,,, the thinner paper markets of lesser metals will be absolutely devastated. Yes we will see $50.00 silver in our time,,,,,, $50.00 for a hundred ounce bar,,,,, that is! No less a relative price decline for the other metals is in store. Even if these
actual dollar numbers prove incorrect,,,,,, relative inflation adjusted prices will show the exact same ratios to gold. The gain will truly be in gold!

Gold,,,,,, a wealth for changing times,,,,, a wealth as new as it is old!

thanks

A couple comments. . . .
Greetings, my good friend.

I would like to first of all thank you for your very kind words. It is you -- not I --that deserves the accolades. At every turn in this trail you bring us new mental challenges and new understandings of the economic and financial times in which we live. I have always said the message of FOA and Another, whether one agrees with it or not, inspires a deeper meditation of world affairs -- beyond the pablumatic representations of CNBC, et al. How many who read these pages could say that they have not walked away with something valuable each time they walk this Trail? That's why I am proud -- make that honored -- to sponsor and be a part of this page. A humble bow in your direction, FOA.

So now you mention that Another believes that the ECBs Mr. Duisenberg is on his way out and it appears that you also take seriously the report from News Max that Alan Greenspan may be close to retirement as well. These would indeed be major changes on the world financial scene that I do not think the markets, including gold and stocks, have even mildly factored into current pricing.

So now do we see what the French might do with the ECB?

I have always thought the French central bank to have a Gaullist heart no matter what was happening in the French politicial sector. It has been unwavering in its position on gold leases (strongly against) as well as its position on gold reserves ( strongly for). Of course, the dream of a united Europe was seeded and nurtured by Charles DeGaulle, the same man who said:

"Indeed there can be no criterion, no other standard than gold. Yes, gold which never changes, which can be shaped into ingots, bars, coins, which has no nationality and which is eternally and universally accepted as the unalterable fiduciary value par excellence."

DeGaulle was a strategist and masterful politician. He understood that gold was the key to breaking away from the dollar for Europe, and that idea has stuck in European politics, particularly French politics, from immediately after the War. He led the move to repatriate European gold from the United States in the 1960s (at $35/oz). He led the move in forming the intellectual beginnings of a United Europe. And now France and Germany together can dictate the direction of the EU confederation. It seems that gold has staked out inviolable territory in the EU thanks in large part to the French Gaullist influence within that country, and it will be interesting to see what a French head of ECB might do next.

Those among us who treat the suggestion of a gold drain from the United States to defend the dollar as unpatriotic should recall that the United States and Great Britain have not been the victims of a hostile takeover with respect to our lost gold reserves. As a matter of fact, the United States and Great Britain invited it, indeed acquiesced to it -- just as Great Britain invited and acquiesced to the drain of gold reserves over the last few years. All justified -- then and now -- by one lame-brained analysis after another. I have always said that nations do not ship gold reserves because they want to; they ship gold reserves because they have to. Usually, as you point out, for political reasons -- and the gold becomes "political gold" meant to buy time or prevent one politican or another from being blamed for the collapse of the dollar. So we sink ever deeper every day (with more and more dollars piling-up overseas by the day, the result of a massive U.S. balance of payments problem) with no apparent solution on the horizon. Let's make that no apparent solution save one: The threat of destroying the U.S. export market if its trading partners fail to hold U.S. government debt. Why wouldn't the U.S. gold reserve come into play under such circumstances. To be sure, there are those who believe it already has! (Though I, for one, do not relish that possibility.)

Back in 1997 when I was still writing in mainstream publications, MoneyWorld magazine published an article I had written titled: "The Real Story Behind Central Bank Gold Sales." I wrote the article having suffered through dozens of articles published in the mainstream press that the "central banks" were selling gold and would continue to sell gold. This, they maintained,was the weight hanging on the gold market that would not let the price go up. We should keep in mind that this article was written long before bullion bank involvement (leasing and carry trade programs) in the gold market became common knowledge and widely blamed for gold's woes. My goal was to destroy the mythology that "central banks" as a group (in its entirety) were pro-gold sales because they were not.

I started with a simple division of central banks. I put the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in one camp and called it "the Anglo-American countries." I put Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Belgium and Austria in the other camp and called it "the Countinental European countries." I then tracked their gold reserve holdings as groups from 1965 on. The results were incredibly interesting. They also spelled out in very clear terms that it was not the "central banks" who had been gold sellers through the period but the Anglo-American group. In order to understand what is really going in the gold market, I see this division an an important demarcation point.

Total Anglo-American reserves went from 15,754 tonnes in 1965 to 9197 in 1996 -- a loss of 42%. The U.S. went from 12,499 in 1965 to 8138 by 1996. Of course much of that came well before Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, but some was also sold in a series of futile gold auctions in the mid-1970s. Britain went from 2012 tonnes in 1965 to 717 in 1996 (and now 350 tonnes due to the latest round of gold auctions to kick off the 21st century.) So Britain's gold reserve is almost nil. It now holds 17% of the gold it did in 1965 and explains the virulent anti-gold posturing by the British press, politicians, international bankers and bureaucrats. But if Britain's gold situation seems remarkable, Canada's has been even more prodigal. It now holds 9% of the gold it had on reserve in 1965. And the policies of currency destruction continue in that country virtually unabated.

Continental Europe in the same period went from 17,740 tonnes to 16,007 -- a drain to be sure but nowhere near what the Anglo-American countries had sold. Since 1996, the only anomaly in this pattern has been the Swiss sales -- one I am still scratching my head over. You will note that what was lost in the Anglo American camp did not show up on European central bank balance sheets. Some of it showed up in the Asian official sector, but the majority of it, it would seem, has gone into private hands -- a trend I suspect will continue given the history of monetary management over the past 100 years on both sides of the Atlantic.

And then there is always the potential for secret acquisitions on the national level -- operations too sensitive to reach the International Monetary Fund's annual blue book tallies -- something I would not totally discount. I recall Toyoo Gyohten's comment of several years back. He is "the" heavyweight in Japanese banking circles and former chairman of the Bank of Tokyo. "The size of our gold reserve," he said, "really did affect our status in international monetary discussions." Japan for the record holds 750 tonnes -- up from 292 tonnes in 1965. That statement was made prior to the famous Iyaru Hashimoto (former prime minister) comment that Japan would sell U.S. Treasuries and buy gold indicating that the at the very least, the Japanese at the highest levels have discussed gold ownership.

So you see, my dear FOA, you are absolutely correct about the potential for dollar settlement for gold. One thing I have learned over the many years I have studied the gold market is that events seem at time to move glacially only to rev up just when you least expect it. The British sales are part of a long term program tied to the policies of John Maynard Keynes and the defense of the dollar. That era is coming to an end with the recent rumblings by the Bush administration to reduce the influence of the IMF (a creation of John Maynard Keynes along with the World Bank and the rest of the Bretton Woods system).

I too foresee a new international financial architecture wherein gold plays a key role.

I would like to hear your thoughts on the potentiality of Alan Greenspan's retirement before going further. Do you see this as part of a larger picture related to euro introduction? Or just good timing for our Fed chairman. Knowing Mr. Greenspan's affinity for gold as pointed out in the Gilded Opinion piece "Gold and Economic Freedom" -- an essay which he recently said he would not change a word of.

I would point out to our readers that if I am understanding you correctly, and I think I am, you think that these gold movements of gold out of the United States would occur at very high dollar prices -- a currency windfall for gold holders. Are you also saying that at the same time buying gold in the United States would be problematic?

Do you believe there is anything the United States might do to prevent an extraordinary gold price?

I know, and would point out to our readers, that this is all conjecture, but it is interesting conjecture.

Political Gold 2

Hello MK and everyone!

I thought I would add a few thoughts now; before working on several new "talks" and a long absorbing reply to MKs post here.

OH boy,,,,, did everyone read J. Turk's latest? I did and am carrying a shovel with his name on it. (smile),,,,, if I ever run into him I'll use it to cover the guy up with praise and admiration! Fine work and great conclusions! This should just about cap the story as it breaks open.

Of course, the US still owns it's gold and has yet to ship any of it's official stocks of the same. A quick check of the ounces held in storage will confirm that. Any physical gold that has "walked from our accounts", to date, came from some other supplier. We contend that this bullion was the
same stores that were "lifted" from other 3rd world countries in return for US support during their various banking and currency crisis of the 90s. See back as few talks.

Now, the big question is; will the US stand behind it's international "legal tender" obligations and ship it's official gold when serious crisis and currency support protocols demand it? Our record isn't good in this area. In 1971 our dollar held an even closer connection to gold that any of the modern IMF "paper gold" substitutes today and we still closed the window! Still, we think that at this time in history, given the Euro competition, US "political gold" will be shipped to keep the dollar in play. Nothing illegal, mind you, just basic currency defense as needed.

Several years ago, many gold bugs and gold advocates missed the path as the trail turned. Something I pointed out at the beginning of these "message" talks. As most of you will no doubt agree, almost all gold discussion still centers around "the dollar's war with gold". Truly, the evolution of this story will be how that war ended then and now the dollar's war with the Euro began! A very large part of that war strategy, employed by the ECB/BIS, was to let the dollar / IMF faction hang themselves by expanding and supporting the whole arena of this dollar paper gold market. Inflating
the gold market place with so much "paper gold" that we would eventually have to bankrupt ourselves just to keep the dollar in the war game against the Euro.

Because Saudi Arabia is a member of the BIS and marks it's currency to the SDR, we are going to be hard pressed, for oil reasons, not to ship against demands. Perhaps, oil's continued settlement in dollars is directly tied to gold,,,, Do ya think?

Further, much of the current credit in our modern gold market place is backed with this "legal tender" of the IMF. As we have contended for years, 90% of the entire modern
dollar gold market is a paper game first, and that will burn as the dollar loses it's position as the reserve currency. All these Giants that are holding physical gold and credible paper" are going to win big as escalating gold values displace their dollar asset base. There are a few of you smart cookies out there that "NOW" understand what we have been getting at for such a long time.

We have said all along that how much credibility your "paper gold" holdings enjoy will depend on just how important you are in the scheme of worldly economic and political affairs. Last on this list, I can assure you, are all the paper traders on various public and "industry use" gold exchanges. Did I once hear some paper brokers scoff, on various internet forums, that real gold supply was what was moving the market,,,, and that all this talk about paper gold was a joke?? Hmmmmm,,,, the trail is soon to become very, very quiet on this account. I say into this silence, plan your "asset" moves wisely as the future is now directly before you!

Yes, the war now is between the Euro and the dollar! The Washington Agreement placed gold "on the road to high prices" as it signaled a phasing out of Euro support for our American gold values. How fast gold can, now, rise will gauge how much staying power the dollar has in all this. If there is any gold war now, it's to be in just how fast the dollar gold market can disintegrate into worthless
IOUs! So, don't count on this destruction of our paper gold market to mark the real value and availability of physical gold; that ratio will split somewhere down the goldtrail. This action will scare most harden gold investors to death; especially the ones in leveraged gold stocks and lesser white metals!

Ha! Ha! What a revelation and change of events for paper gold players. What an exciting day and future for physical gold advocates! To paraphrase and old 1970s texas oil commercial:

------ "If you don't have a gold broker, get one! You'll love doing business with Centennial! ----

Hello again, everyone.

Yes, I am still working on several posts. Some of then involving the current SDR discussion and how its evolution has changed the face of modern bullion banking. Randy Strauss offered a very good map of how these international paper gold assets came into the world. I'll draw a few more lines on the paper to show where that map leads us today.

No, our bullion reserves are no more ours than navy war ships are ours. Still, both items are fair and legal assets to use in defense! One in war and the other in currency skirmishes. Truly, it is coming to that.

I am between entertaining and talking to some thinkers about what comes next, politically. Hope to get some of this into words next week. Have a good weekend (smile).

http://www.bday.co.za/bday/content/direct/1,3523,913236-6078-0,00.html
I'll be back a little later with some "coffee cup" discussion and views of MKs last post here (and much more) (smile).

Here is one that most dollar bulls never saw coming:

=================
German economy improving: Ifo

------ MUNICH - The German economy showed signs of improving on Wednesday after the widely-followed Ifo index of the western German business climate rose unexpectedly to 89.8 points in July from 89.5 points in June. ----------- Analysts had been expecting a sharp fall in the index, which is conducted by the Ifo economic institute and is closely watched by financial markets. ------------ The euro broke the psychologically-important level of $0.92 shortly after the figures were released, rising to its highest level in five months. ------------------ end
======================

The war between gold and the dollar has been over for a while now. The action, today, is between the dollar and the euro arena and this is what will break the price lock on gold. Leaving gold bugs with a lot of questions that ask why this: both systems will strive for a higher currency price for gold; one doing it because they have to; the other doing it because they want to! The casualty on this battlefield will be the world gold market as we know it. A market caught between how Western perception thinks gold's price should be "discovered" and at what price level trading in physical gold craters the entire paper structure. A structure of American based "paper gold".

We have been saying for some time that this will be "the" show to watch unfold; but only if your holdings allow you to stay still in your seat as it happens (smile).

back later

Part 1

Hello MK!

In your message # 95, posted here on the trail, I saw a nice invitation to engage in some "conjecture" and a warm cup of coffee. Sounded too good to pass up. Actually, the seasons are changing, high up here on the trail, and it won't be long before cold weather demands much hot coffee to follow the path. Later, I'll be at my little house in Florida as winter arrives in the northern half of the globe. As you know I live in several places, but our USA is the only real home. (smile)
=========================

Mike,

You mentioned DeGaulle's famous quote that ended with: "as the unalterable fiduciary value par excellence". He made that statement in 1965, but Pindar also said in 522-442 BC: "Gold is the child of Zeus. Neither moth nor rust devoureth it."!

Do you see the common thread linking these thoughts; neither time or lineage brought these gentlemen to think of gold as money. Ha! Ha!, I just had to throw that in there (big grin).

Actually, referring to your chain of thought,,,,,, I don't think we can be so sure that the Gaullist of our reference period can be the same as the ones in power today. Our Charles, the one that passed on in 1970, was a military man and even taken prisoner once. His thoughts on gold and money were molded from a harsh war experience and an extreme political interventionism common in that era. To this end, his positioning had to promote French nationalism, even in money affairs, if his Fifth French Republic was to hold up. To his credit, and far more important than his gold stance, he planted many of the seeds we see as trees today. Back then, he was leading France to be part of a greater regional economic power; early on he stroked Russia, China, even Iran and Iraq. Even though none of these nation states remotely resemble, then, what they are today; the thrust was an
ideology to unite the economies more so than the powers.

Mike, in this, you are so very correct to note his "forming the intellectual beginnings of a United Europe". Still, the hard money people and leaders, we grew up with, have all moved on. The ones now in "positions of influence" and "outright power" are our very piers. Many are not far from our age group and in this; the range of life experiences, so similar to ours, so shape modern money thought. Yes, they studied the same history books we did, but have evolved to embrace different forces shaping this, oh so, different world. If you want to see the Euro Gaullist of today, just look into a mirror and try to reach for their same understandings. Its not hard to do.

How long will this era last; how much will it all change the dollar's timeline; can EuroLand ever be the same animal it once was??? Questions that only time will answer. For us, today, we follow their progress for our direction and understanding.

In a recent Financial Times article out of Paris, Jacques Chirac (French Precident) and Lionel Jospin (prime minister) were both noted for talking about the coming ECB succession. One of the few points they agree on (few indeed) centers around the fact that a Frenchman will head it next. Still, more so than knowing who will lead; understanding the political strategy that's unfolding is what counts. Seeing all this with my eyes, we can envision the posturing very clearly.

As this reserve currency transition, or perhaps war is a better term, moves on; the ECB must shift it's thrust with a leadership statement. Wim Duisenberg provided an excellent political cover for selling into the American paper gold market; as it exists around the world today. His national pedigree demonstrated a distinct flavor against gold as a monetary reserve. Truly, the ECB could not be seen prompting all their big bullion banks to short American paper gold, if they ECB / BIS were serious gold advocates. In our time of Western thinking, who could understand such a contradiction? But, politically, the game was to serve two goals; temporally support the dollar for trade settlement until the Euro was on its feet (sending gold prices down); and inflating the American lead gold market until it burst from over issuance. A good chuck of this ties into the SDR
issue that I'll get to later.

Now,,,, with the US vs Europe economic war in full bloom today; and Euro money policy in a position of leadership; and Euro circulating currency about to begin; it's time for a shift of thrust. Jean-Claude Trichet, or at least someone of his same pedigree, will usher in a new position;
"physical gold is a great asset for private and official sectors to save"! Bamm!!! Suddenly, our decades old paper gold game will run smack into a new idea; "Euro promotion for private gold ownership" and "high gold prices are good"! And more importantly; this concept will be presented from the controllers of the next reserve currency!

Contrast this against a whole world invested in gold as a hedge,,,,, by owning all of an American sanctioned paper gold market that's inflated 1,000 times beyond physical reality. (smile) Makes a physical gold advocate feel real good inside; like this warm cup of coffee! (double wide smile)

This is the new Gaullist; a variant time traveler who arrived from failed official gold wars that pitted currencies against bullion. Never again!

Part 2

Hello all!

Well,,,,, with my replies drifting somewhere in cyberspace, I asked our speaker to return and address a whole cross section of recent developments. Besides, this guy always could hit the mark better than me. (if I don't find those documents, some heads are going to roll for sure) (smiling with a medieval ax in my hand). OK,,,,, let's chair up to a nice round table talk:

==========================================================

Good evening Mr. Kosares, nice of you to spare some time to join us.

Historically it's appropriate for French thought to be, once again, influencing Euro Zone gold policy. In an Alpha / Omega analogy, their pro gold stance should prove to be a fitting conclusion of our 30 years of gold suffocation. It will also be most satisfying, I presume, for them to see gold valued and used independent of money function and American's "dollar foreign policy".

I agree with you, in that gold has its own territory staked out within a broad range of EU economic and currency initiatives. In time, this policy will be much more clear and further entertain a close scrutiny from all other domestic powers. I submit that this day has always been on record "as coming"; even though noone could mark it prominently on their calendar until now.

===

We enjoyed your dissertation about "the threat of an official US gold drain". It records, not only the numbers, well, but also points to long running common political attitudes concerning gold and its prominent position in international currency valuations. This recognition of gold being an important official currency measure, is something Western Gold Bugs have consistently longed for. Now with it openly acknowledged thru outright manipulation, these same thinkers object to it's being used in a similar manner as currency? It seems they want gold branded "important"; only as long as such branding makes the price go higher; not lower. In their minds this somehow places bullion in a different category from currencies that are routinely forced up and down for political objectives.

Ah yes, to this end I must present a exert from my good friend who cannot keep track of his files (smile):

---- You know,,,, I look at the last several decades of modern paper gold trading and cannot help but think of Arizona (state in the USA). Throughout the region they have roads going over old stream beds labeled "dry wash / subject to flooding". With this context I can construct a good analogy with American gold investors.

A guy begins building his house of wealth in the middle of one of these dry washes. A known gold expert comes along and tells him; "hey buddy, that old stream bed floods from time to time". The Bug says,,,, yea I know, but I only plan to be here for a quick trade or two,,,,, I know it's unstable and washes out every so often,,,,,, taking all paper values with it. I'll just catch some good sun between the rain,,, I'll be ok.

Well,,,, years go by and the rain comes and he gets washed out a few times more that usual,,,,,, but the guy still stays,,,,,, even thought the paper gold price keeps getting washed ever lower. Then,,,,,,, a huge unending wash comes even when no rain is falling. After seeing his house of wealth float away with a falling paper price he decides to walk upstream and find out why all this water keeps
driving the gold price down??

By god,,,,,,,, miles later he finds a government dam that suddenly started releasing tonnes of water all the time. He raised hell and said it wasn't right,,,,,, but the man at the valve said they aren't doing anything any different than what this type of "paper market"-- I mean stream bed,,,,, was built for. This is a derivatives market, son,,,, meant for betting on the flow,,,, not building a house from it!

If all the public is just speculating on when the rain will fall,,,, why is it so wrong for the government to do it,,,,,, and help maintain your lifestyle to boot. Besides, if all your gold talk is so right,,,,, then we are catering to gold advocates and making physical prices more reasonable???

But the Bug says,,,,,, hey, this isn't a natural market,,,, I mean stream flow!! This bed was only suppose to flow between natural dry and wet spells,,, like a real free bullion market! In reply the valve man asked,,,,, who the hell told you that??? The Bug answered:

I learned it from My Broker!

===================

Sir Kosares,
American dollar policy has built a substantial wall of separation between its currency and gold. More philosophical than material, the last decades of official declarations have served to block any useful "voluntary" return to high dollar gold prices. At every turn of the road, treasury and fed spoke persons have said that a low gold price indicates good dollar management. The price and time needed to reverse such a "learned experience" would, today, be enormous. Thus, we see a trapped currency policy that can only travel toward intense dollar inflation, riding ever lower paper gold values until both processes default; both printing press and price wise.

The reality of all this is that dollar gold prices could have soared as far back as 1971 and the world could have gone its way. I believe that noone would have left the dollar then, even with $5,000 gold, because no other currency system was ready to assume the dollar roll. Yes, US inflation rates would have soared and world economic trade would have fallen victim to mangled exchange rates: but that happened anyway and the dollar would still have retained it's reserve status.

This drive to prove the dollar, in low gold prices, now comes to its destine end. An end extended by inducing paper gold inflation backed by ever more official involvement in the world gold markets. The dollar faction is pumping paper gold to support the dollar while the Euro / BIS faction has shifted to doing the same to destroy the paper gold market faster. In recognition to my good friend's story --- the water flow is now washing away dreams and exposing houses built in the wrong place---. Indeed, why on earth would Western thinking Gold Bugs believe in a paper gold system that could only show value if it was not inflated? Did they expect a deflation in paper gold to drive prices up?

Their government considers their current derivatives based gold market to be just as important a tool in economic and international affairs as the dollar gold exchange standard was prior to 71. America opened the dam to let gold contracts flow thru the dry wash then, as dollars were printed to inflate the largest paper proxy the gold market traded with: dollar gold!

If this was important to maintain US lifestyles at that time: so why would it not be important now? They destroyed worldwide wealth held in gold, in the form paper dollar proxies. They changed the very currency of the world to gain an American end. Now Bugs cannot believe this same system would inflate their same little market to extend the same courtesy again? In the process, this time, also destroying the whole of the gold industry.

A strong dollar policy is built upon a low gold price; once again by inflating the widest scope of the usable gold markets: credit gold. In an incredible contradiction, it seems that the real fools are the gold bugs who buy into this paper market expecting some kind of deflation to drive the contracts higher? In order for this to happen, the US would have to counter modern gold thought with policy that said; high priced gold is unimportant to dollar policy. More than ever, with Euro competition creating a currency war, dollar gold must fall or the whole system must freeze up! Dollar prices cannot rise until the entity of our credit gold market is removed from function. This will happen.

=============================

I have presented this topic many times and again state that "all gold paper will burn". Most mine values included. Then and only then will gold values soar as physical units traded. Not before. As an adjunct, the illusion of most American paper wealth will also burn with this process that
transitions the dollar away from reserve status.

At the right time the Euro Zone will withdraw from the IMF, leaving the US and its factions as the only support for dollar credit assets held overseas. Then the evolution of SDR use our guide knows so well will be complete. This will leave the SDR interpretation open to only one avenue to finding support: it's basket currency function dissolved, gold will have to flow from American based stocks. With most of the present official credit gold leverage built upon IMF protocols, the US will find itself shipping ever higher priced gold to defend an ever lower valuation of dollar exchange rates.

With the world credit gold markets paralyzed in default and dollar credibility placed in question along with American economic stamina; physical gold will return to official hands in Europe in exchange for Euros. A paradox observed as high gold places more demands upon Euros and sends the dollar ever lower.

=====================

In all of this Alan Greenspan will say good by. A gentleman of his ability and stature will find no use for a position he cannot change from; a good general does not only retreat. Any lesser player can buy public and treasury debt for the purpose of constant hyper inflation; there is no policy strategy or gamesmanship in this.

As for gold being a problem to buy in the USA? Once again, I point out that American policy has only the wish to manipulate its currency valuations with official currency trading. It will be in the US advantage for gold prices to rise and rise strongly. An acknowledgment to Euro planning and a defeat for 30 years of American gold misuse. If treasury gold is traded at all, it will be within official channels to help control dollar values.

However, as paper gold values freeze up and their use fails the public, physical bullion brokers will become a popular as "crude oil" is to producers. I wish you "a deep well" in your affairs, my friend, and will respond more for a time.

======================================

Thanks Mr. speaker,,,,

Thanks all

European Money Supply Growth Accelerated in July, Analysts Say By Sonja Dieckhoefer

--------- Benchmark interest rates in Europe are currently 100 basis points above rates in the U.S., \`\`causing investors to turn to Europe,'' said CDC's Nehls-Obegi. That may also have lifted M3 in July, she said. The ECB said \`\`non-resident holdings of money market paper and debt securities issued with a maturity up to two years'' have been distorting M3 growth figures higher. ---------

==========================

The beginning of a reversed carry trade? I think Michael Kosares called this one long before anyone else could see that far down the path.

I'm working on a rewrite for the trail. Watching, hiking, talking and writing all at the same time.(smile)

Is that Milton Friedman I see peeking from behind that boulder??
Hello again, my friend. From your last post I was struck by this statement, one I am still pondering:

"As for gold being a problem to buy in the USA? Once again, I point out that American policy has only the wish to manipulate its currency valuations with official currency trading. It will be in the US advantage for gold prices to rise and rise strongly. An acknowledgment to Euro planning and a defeat for 30 years of American gold misuse. If treasury gold is traded at all, it will be within official channels to help control dollar values. However, as paper gold values freeze up and their use fails the public, physical bullion brokers will become as popular as "crude oil" is to producers."

I am particularly interested in your view that " it will be in the US advantage for gold prices to rise and rise strongly." Of course that is 180º from the current policy where the messenger throttled, imprisoned and killed in the hopes that the vacant dollar policy is not exposed to the world. Of course, as you have pointed out the euro could very well change all that. I also detect a hint that the oil producers might want "oil for gold" when you say "it [gold settlement] will be within official channels to help control dollar values."

I don't know if you saw the story today, but our friend Milton Friedman (who once proclaimed that the U.S. gold reserve should be put on the block and sold en masse to the highest bidder) proclaimed today that the euro was a "a big mistake."

What I think you might find fascinating are the reasons why he believes this. According to Forbes magazine, Friedman slammed the the euro "saying that it would create monetary turbulence and discrepancies instead of promoting political unity."

God forbid that we should suffer "discrepancies!"

Whoa, , ,Ho! Ho!

It is not difficult to see what he is really saying. The euro is going to get in the way. It's going to cause "turbulence!" (not that the dollar hasn't served this purpose all too well on its own.) And then there's "political unity." How could the Europeans be so . . . .well. . . .so totally uncooperative."

Here's the capper:

The esteemed Stanford professor goes on to say that "the U.S. should pull out of recession in 2002 but that recent Fed interest rate cuts could lead to inflationary problems."

"I believe the United States is already in recession," said Friedman, "The fall in production and employment show that clearly. Whether or not we use the word 'recession' is just a question of semantics," He also pointed to the Fed's seven interest rates cuts this year as reason to look out for inflation next year. "With the very unusual Federal Reserve policy of successive interest rates cuts...the key problem once the recession ends in 2002 will be how to control inflation," he said.

So its very clear:

With inflation just around the corner, it is difficult enough to deal with one inflation indicator let alone two. . . . .two safe havens not just one. What's the dollar to do?

Guess it all get's down to a matter of perspective. I've always contended that if the U.S. gold reserve is to be sold that it ought to be offered to the American public on a first refusal basis. (Grin.)

Thought this would be enough to raise a comment or two. . . . .

My best to Another, and hoping this finds you both well. MK

Just a walk down the path!

Good day everyone.

---- Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both -------- I shall be telling this with a sigh---Somewhere ages and ages hence: ----I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference ----

This partial caption, as it appears at the top of our trails page, tells of the Gold Advocate story through out this modern gold era. An era that has so very decimated the savings of traditional hard money paper gold bulls. Clinging to all their failing theories, they assumed were financial hard money law, only to watch those market dynamics evolve away in our political world; taking much of their wealth with it.

So, down the single path we go and boy has that decision made a difference! As Physical Gold Advocates, buying and holding real gold for the future, we have avoided taking an enormous hit to the "safe side" of our long term savings. When one adds up the net accumulated loses from a decade of "gold market timing", in and out "leveraged plays" and good money poured down the "liar's hole" of gold mining prospects; is it any wonder so many are clamoring for the government to come clean and return policy back towards support for the "illusion of our paper gold market"? Back towards the leveraged player's favor so he can get even: perhaps even with coin buyers?

In a large part, this explains a lot about the cross currents and confusion gold buyers hear in today's media. Two entirely separate factions are in the gold game; one vocal and unhappy, the other quiet and very pleased to buy gold at lower prices. If you invested in the commodity side of our gold industry, that's the new gold supply side produced by the mining sector, you need a higher price or
your investment will eventually become zero wealth! If you invested into the real asset side of the market, physical gold owned and held as part of your long term wealth, higher values will one day come and easily match all the considerable currency inflation that has already arrived. For these buyers, life is good as lower prices and time are both on their side.

But, what of the guy that brought into our leveraged gold markets; thinking it was a free market that represented the real value and price for gold bullion? Was he a victim of a government currency supporting scam that rendered his leverage a loss? Or was he the victim of an market industry that told him not to buy physical gold, instead take advantage of the leverage we can sell you?

Ask yourself: who said years ago that we know how it all works and how to out maneuver this dollar inflation stuff, ,,, who said the paper leveraged gold markets were the real free markets,,,, and we know how the government does all this because we are professionals,,,, and we have a good leveraged play that will beat that inflation when it comes and beat it X times over!

The answer we hear: "Now that these leveraged plays have and are turning into toilet paper,,,,, we want to know why the government made us buy all this stuff" ,,,, instead of real gold????

In our society, dominated by Western Thoughts about savings wealth and the use of leverage to gain it, Paper Gold Advocates have advanced the logic of their position by using overlapping reasoning. Promoting an idea that share ownership in an industry, that sells gold to make a cash profit, is the same as ownership of the gold product they produce. This is the same thinking progression where history records a shoemaker's children without shoes. Following this you, as a paper gold investor, also risk a situation where your family goes barefoot, without real wealth, while political maneuverings wipes out your stock and trade business investment; not to mention your wealth. In the same social dynamic where friends point out the shoemaker's bare feet, physical gold advocates will one day be asking; "but I thought he owned a gold mine?"

=================

I read all the fine articles and elaboration about the woes of our gold mining industry, it's investors and losers that played leveraged paper bets against this evolving market. Still, we are struck by a glaring flaw in their presentations: instead of taking the high ground with Physical Gold Advocates and advise dumping paper investments in this politically manipulated market and buying gold with the proceeds, they sink to the background and wait for a legal retort that would eventually lock up their lost illusion wealth for good. In the process they are trying to legitimize their use of the same failed logic the mines and paper brokers pushed; "buy our industry not the gold product its all based on"!

For decades, this entire paper hard money reasoning reeked from terrible political understanding. They tried to sell hard wealth logic packaged into something new players couldn't resist: ----- " I know you are a smart gold thinker that knows the real money inflation score! And because you are immersed in Western Thought, you can understand our logic better than most average people; let the other simple people buy real gold while you buy something that is just as good and pays off x times better; all our near gold substitutes"! ---------

Truly, the reactions we are hearing today, on many gold forums and all over the hard money media, is the "hangover" of investors being sold that logic as a "static" law of the money universe! Without their being exposed to the fact that money, gold and politics are all an intertwined dynamic human action; coursing through nations and society, as organic players fight to hang onto our real wealth and savings over time.

The notion that "real wealth" and "money function" could be combined and retained, for trade use and as a long term savings for average man, was a dream for hard money socialist. These two separate forces were stamped together and coined by a narrow logic that never would concede how incompatible it was with changing human desires.

Again, this "hangover" of loses is the result of layer after layer of misconception being placed over real gold ownership. The sad fact is that those who stand outside the ranks of Physical Gold Advocates will mostly not ever catch up, financially, with simple gold owners! The world, it seems, turns once again as it always has.

===================

Yes MK, I saw Milton over there behind that rock. His comments and understandings are like the wines his old (part owned) vineyard produced; sometimes ok, sometimes bad. Years ago, when I lived in San Diego, we often went to his winery: San Pasqual in the Temecula valley area,,, if I remember right? Don't think he owns it any more. I never liked their wines, but one of his wine vinegars was absolutely fantastic. We stopped at Chinos vegetable farm, around the corner from us, on the way for a sunday drive. While later cooking, I would recall how I could only like some of
his offerings.

Today, my tastes for "a changing currency universe" is proving just as correct in opposing much of his thinking. Along the same lines our friend PH in LA said; we have to stop watching our favorite trees and start watching the whole forest!

=================

You write: ----- I am particularly interested in your view that " it will be in the US advantage for gold prices to rise and rise strongly.---------

I think this whole concept is the most difficult part for people to grasp. We wrote many portions of this logic and tried to tie it into unfolding events so it would be clear. Problem is that this was so spread out, as it occurred over years, it's hard to see it all.

A most interesting part, one I think will be studied later, is in the evolution of our modern paper money dynamic itself. The US was way behind the curve in grasping how our changing "world economic function" was reworking the use, demand and nature of how fiat money settled commerce. Even with all it's awful inflationary attributes, we were evolving with the markets to use our fiat moneys in ways that were in spite of their losing value. Had American money policy seen this in process, they could have dropped the war on gold long ago; the way the Europeans have already.

Still, as part of this political war of economies and currencies, the ECB / BIS played into our gold war theme. Aside from a separate strategy that kept cheap gold commitments flowing for cheap oil,,,,, Euroland played our gold war, too, as we murdered the paper marketplace along with the whole dollar gold system it was built on. I think that the US, just recently, caught on to the "total meaning" of the Washington agreement and is now rethinking what to do with their position.

They shifted their war on gold to become a war on the Euro,,,, only too late. Now, knowing that the Euro is a fact, we must have a super gold price if the dollar is to stay in the game! The question becomes one of supporting a cheap paper price for the sole function of keeping the market and all its bullion players alive. With the war on gold over, they need to turn their tanks around to face the
real enemy but cannot.

If we try to save the dollar gold markets, they will morph into a pure paper system with no gold supply to back them; paper would eventually be priced way below world physical markets. They will become a pure cash settlement item, in a way like the OEX. This will easily drive oil pricing into Euros. If we adopt a week dollar policy, trash the IMF and it's SDRs (prior to ECB withdrawal) we will have to supply gold bullion outright and allow a true market price based on some currency supporting function; still at thousands per ounce. Our entire anglo - London gold markets will spin off hugh,,,,, nation busting financial loses. By the way,,,, this is why our boy is driving for EMU as soon as possible. (smile)

In all of this; the main story / component is oil supply! We must keep our dollar function, if only in a diminished fashion, in order to buy oil imports. Once the dollar fully fails, everyone (our partners like Mexico and Canada) will bolt for using Euros as reserves and international settlements. OIL value in the US would spike sky high even as local inflation drives alternative energy supplies to
become uneconomic to produce. Even at $200 a barrel equivalent.

========================

You write ------ Guess it all gets down to a matter of perspective. I've always contended that if the U.S. gold reserve is to be sold that it ought to be offered to the American public on a first refusal basis. (Grin.)---------

Mike, I know you guys have written some fine thoughts about how the government may one day take our private gold back. I have to allow that we never know what they will do: a lot of nuts become favorite leaders??? Still, we say that the government already has it's gold back. They took back what was "legal tender" , then ,,,, and won't try to get at what is now private gold wealth.

Just like the dollar tender in your pocket, US bullion is not yours to begin with. They have the right to call it in. This area is also a hard concept for gold thinkers to come to grips with. After decades of being told that the gold in Fort Knox belongs to the public, the truth that it doesn't and never was Its impending use as a currency supporting supplement is shaking people up that believed that position. Soooo many investors thought that this gold reserve was there to back their currency at home, at some future high price, that they reasoned they could just buy gold mine stocks with their investment moneys for an added play. Letting a future currency deflation and a rising gold price meet at some high price in the middle and back up their other surviving shoe box savings! Again, this ain't gona happen! Our currency is going to inflate to hell, even as we clean out our official gold reserves to ship overseas. If ever there was a story to buy gold for your own,,,, this is the tail that will create a killer offtake the world over!

However, the political choice, as you alluded to above, should will be allowed to buy our governments gold,,,,, if offered,,,,,, OR have that gold keep oil prices down to $90 a barrel so we can still drive SUVs. I wonder what will happen???

===============

As a side item: I see where George Mitchell sold out his Mitchell energy and development. Funny, I know a guy that used to play with him as barefoot boys on Galveston streets. He said that young George once wondered (as boys do) if a small growth in his nose would finish him off. I think he had internal radium treatment for it or something?? Oh my,,,, who would have known that this barefoot brilliant friend would one day sell out as a billionaire?? What a wonderful, free country!

I'll post more about SDRs and Randy's notes if things don't go haywire again!

Thanks all (and MK)

Perceptions: The evolving message of gold and what it means
http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?mnu=news&ptitle=Currency%20Europe&tp=ad_uknews&T=news_storypage99.ht&ad=euro_currency&s=AO4zDXxLwRUNCJ3Mg

Here are a few quick observations:

It would be nice if our Fed could manage it's dollar policy with an eye on value only. This was suppose to be their job but it became morphed into an economic policy instead.

In his comments today, the ECB's Welteke makes a clear distinction between these two institution's thoughts on the matter:

------ Firstly, it isn't the ECB council's mandate to steer economic growth, but to stabilize the value of money. Price stability is the top goal of the European System of Central Banks. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a mandate that includes growth and employment targets ---------------

Notice that phrase "to stabilize the value of money"? After several decades of evolution, US traders have come to equate the value of a currency as to whether money policy is delivering them investment profits or no. If local prices of stocks and real estate are rising, then a money's exchange rate should also. It's only natural because everyone the world over will want in on the "next great investment"; where ever that process is being played out!

Of course, that's not the way money values are determined; but because international trade has delivered money flow control into the hands of an "out of control" dollar derivatives market, this is the thinking dynamic in charge. No greater case can be made that; world wide currency values are but an illusion while being measured with a dollar reserve system. We see this ever so clearly today as the ECB strives to place a real value upon their currency by employing strengthening rates of return behind it; saying that a nation's currency is worth something aside from structural economic function alone. All the while the Fed is inflating the dollar as an open sign that the dollar is worthless if our economy goes "only sideways" for a while.

What an incredible reversal of perceptions for American traders to latch on to; we are buying into the dollar inflation as a permanent structural component of our economic and financial markets. This trend is something we, as gold / Euro / oil people, have been promoting will happen for some time. As the Euro matures, this ongoing dynamic will lead to; a dismantling of our dollar reserve system; a flow of us gold out of the country as an only means left to maintain dollar settlement; a rising gold price that first disables, then destroys the current world dollar gold market; hyper inflation within the US and a critical loss of oil imports at cheap dollar valuations.

Our way of life and quality of life will be changing as this plays out. Truly, for those that understand, we will not actually lose anything real; rather we will lose the illusion of wealth Americans have come to value as their given right. An illusion we trade to the world and with each other in the form of an overvalued currency and the assets it denominates.

Again, I'll have more on this if this complex computer system stays together (smile).

Off the trail and on the road! (smile)

Well,,,,,, I tried to get this incredible cluster of wires and chips to work correctly, but to no avail. My computer is fine, something wrong in the private network that supplies me. Anyway, I'll take this interlude to work in some travel time. Have a great Labor Day and I'll be back in a few weeks.

While away, some points to consider:

The Dollar

On the plus side; all thru the 90s it was the best currency to store your extra cash in. No matter if one loved it, hated it or thought it was near destruction, the dollar worked well for its owners. It worked more so because of the way the world changed in using currencies. Not because we managed it so well.

On the negative side; it is a self serving money that caters to one and only one nation state. The needs of all other users of this reserve currency are cast down into second class status.

Because it has been in this reserve position so long, the gross amounts that circulate outside the borders are completely out of any proportion that our local economic structure could service.

Even with a huge, record breaking trade deficit, our fed shows no concern to slow further dollar printing.

The level of sophistication of world trading systems has bypassed the need for a one world, all serving currency unit; like the present IMF dollar system.

The Euro

Its structure, using several central banks, is very close to our dollar system. From that point the closeness ends.

Its political structure is much more appealing to world wide users. Because it's based on a number of different nation states, its management policy will tend to carry more of a worldly mix of initiatives. Not something for everyone, but far better than the dollar.

Its built to have more of an internal function that services EuroZone trading. If it becomes the best (or last) man standing, such an internal flow will cause world trade to flow thru Europe instead of using Euros bypass trade around Europe. This alone will keep it from being a world reserve. Gold wealth may come back to serve this end.

Will it fail?

I don't know! I do know that it will endure. The reason I have moved the cash side of my wealth into Euros is not because it will outrun gold or, for that matter, outrun the dollar in the near term (Euros are a small part of my asset mix with gold being the largest). I changed because I expect the dollar to fail in a super inflation as the world moves on. I expect the Euro to not fail at all or fail less?

Further, the main reason I own gold is because the current dollar gold market does not show us the real gold value at this time. There are a whole host of political reasons why this is so. Still, as the dollar fails, American gold reserves that still exists as the final backing will have to be used in a pure physical market to somewhat deflect the dollar's fall. You can count on the fact that the majority of that US gold will not be, in any way, used to shore up a then failing paper market. As this plays out the current Bullion Bank / london market will lock up and once again rob the paper owners of bullion. No different than the way pre 1971 foreign dollar owners were robbed before the payoff.

The paper gold bulls of that time were waiting for big boys to default on their gold debts,,, like GATA is waiting for today,,,,,,, so the bulls could collect. Didn't happen then and won't happen now.

I expect the dollar to fall away from its present stature in world trade. Bring with it a changing lifestyle for all Americans who have hitched their wealth to dollar related assets. Unfortunately, most gold mine operations are in that league.

I expect gold to do a sky shot, not because of coming us inflation, but first because of a paper gold market abandonment. Then, super dollar price inflation will only drive it higher.

The dollar system, as Mr. G. well knows, is locked into a structural inflationary trend that cannot be stood aside of because of the Euros existence. Any attempt by the fed to raise rates to slow dollar printing will stall our economy further. The Euro system will not, as in the 70s and 80s, have to follow our stance; they no longer have a mandate to bank unneeded trade dollar excesses. They have been sending this strong signal for some time by selling off dollar interest. This trend is going to accelerate as the Euro builds. They have no purpose or reason at this time to get into a real war with the dollar. They are at war just by laying comfortably with a Euro return a little above us for
their work to be done.

Good luck all

The Now Very Clear European Position and Remembrances of Harry Browne's "You Can Profit. .." Books from the Early 1970s. . . .
I see your #106 as one of the most important messages you have ever posted at the Trail or at USAGOLD. In some ways, it is a recapitulation. In other ways, it is groundbreaking.

I believe you are correct. The Europeans will be content to let the dollar take its own course in full knowledge that the seed of currency freedom it has planted is fundamentally sufficient to meet the needs of the new Europe. I do not think however that this was clear until the last euro rate cut. Your post focuses those considerations. Europe will be no more aggressive than it needs to be. As a casual political observor, I believe that this policy is a mistake that forces Europe to play the inflation game along with the United States, and that is not the way I would have played the game given the opportunity. However, I'm not the one calling the shots in Europe. I am an American businessman and investor and in that capacity I am not so much interested in the world as I'd "like it to be" but as "it is." I'm sure my European counterparts feel the same way.

What do you believe this now very clear European position means to the European currency holder and the U.S. currency holder (in the form of savings and equities)in the medium to long run? Do you believe gold ownership is important to the European investor? It is clear that you believe it essential for the U.S.-based investor as you foresee a complete dollar breakdown.

In reading your last message, I was struck with how close it came to Harry Browne's analysis in the early 1970s. In two books, "You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation" and "You Can Profit from the Coming Moneatary Crisis", he laid out a thesis very similar to the groundwork you have laid in your #106. The Wall Street establishment and press considered him the lunatic fringe back then simply because most people never heard of such a thing. He was simply ahead of his time. And he turned out to be absolutely correct.

Here is what you said that made me think of the "You Can Profit Books":

"Further, the main reason I own gold is because the current dollar gold market does not show us the real gold value at this time. There are a whole host of political reasons why this is so. Still, as the dollar fails, American gold reserves that still exists as the final backing will have to be used in a pure physical market to somewhat deflect the dollar's fall."

Of course, this is precisely what happened in the 1970s. Harry Browne made the same argument back then -- that the $35 gold price was both an institutional fixture and institutional fiction. Europe took advantage of that situation by reclaiming a substantial gold reserve. When the London gold pool (both de jure and overt) broke down at the $35 price, the devaluation (both de jure and and overt) quickly followed. Additional formal gold sales proceeded from there from both the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury.

Since today the gold price is both an institutional fixture and institutional fiction much the same process is in motion at present -- only de facto and covert. Are you suggesting a similar result? And with the euro present and accounted for, will it lead to a new world order?

FOA, I want to thank you again for sharing these thoughts with us. I think we may have come to a new Trailhead -- perhas one that looks vaguely familiar, but then again perhaps something totally different. I am convinced you are correct that the Europeans believe that there is a certain historical inevitability to the dollar's demise and there is no need to hasten the process.

The real controversy in the weeks and months to come will revolve around what this might mean to both European and American savers, equity investors and gold owners.

Back on the trail.

Hello everyone!

Well,,,,, I have been home for a few days and my travels were more an adventure than a vacation. During this period of terrible tragedy for our nation, and pain felt for those lost in the destruction, my little world was only shaken in comparison. Still,,,,, almost all my communications was lost for weeks.

I'm back now and am facing a mountain of communiqué from friends and associates. With all that is currently going on I have no intentions of "catching up" with the news thread right now. I just try to jump in as I am able. Truly, this is an unspeakable turn of events and only moves our events timetable that much further ahead.

Michael, Randy,,,, all,,, I'll be back later.

Still Clearing The Trail!

Good Day to Everyone!

Am still working thru a backlog. Yet, I wanted to say that my next address will contain a pre-hike list of answers, points and notes about our views. I'll also be shifting my writing and discussion format so as to clearly separate my thoughts from thoughts from friends and associates. This is something I always planned to do as events came into sharper focus. This change of style should help every person that hikes this path.

In conjunction with this first set of remarks I'll post the next installment of "Walking on Solid Ground". If you thought the first was worth a read, this one will also have value. Thanks Michael, for including that piece in your wonderful quarterly paper! (smile)

The makings of a dust storm

Hello Everyone,,,,, packs on,,,, there is ground to cover!

-------------------

That's not dust from our feet -------

As we walk along this Gold Trail we no longer have to look far ahead to see results; real events are directly under our feet now. True, many will point to this tragic attack on New York and Washington as the catalyst for current woes. But I say that our entire economic structure was already weak and failing from decades of dollar expansion. If these recent events had not come along, something else would have eventually triggered our economic cascade.

The effects are falling into place just as I said they would. -------

As a note to hikers: I will begin using "I" while talking and, from here on out, clearly indicate when I'm speaking the thoughts of a friend or associate. Over the years I have very often spoke the words from others, as they wanted it produced. Often doing entire posts while stating other's positions or inserting their views in my posts, mid stream, without saying I was doing such. We have all come far enough, now, that our understanding can grasp the changing tide without this. My planting seeds of thought in such a way may no longer be needed, but your leg work is far from over. This change is a result of the evolution of our political and financial world just as much as your growing in insight.

Onward

For decades hard money thinkers have been looking for "price inflation" to show up at a level that accurately reflects the dollar's "printing inflation". But it never happened! Yes, we got our little 3, 4, 8 or 9% price inflation rates in nice little predictable cycles. We gasped in horror at these numbers, but these rates never came close to reflecting the total dollar expansion if at that moment it could actually be represented in total worldwide dollar debt. That creation of trillions and trillions of dollar equivalents should have, long ago, been reflected in a dollar goods "price inflation" that reached hyper status. But it didn't.

That "price inflation" never showed up because the world had to support it's only money system until something could replace it. We as Americans came to think that our dollar, and it's illusion of value, represented our special abilities; perhaps more pointedly our military and economic power. We conceived that this wonderful buying power, free of substantial goods price inflation, was our god given right; and the rest of the world could have this life, too, if they could only be as good as us! Oh boy,,,,,, do we have some hard financial learning to do.

----------

Over the years, all this dollar creation has stored up a massive "price inflation effect" that would be set free one day. Hard money thinkers proceeded to expect this flood to arrive every few years or so; the decades passed as those expectations always failed. Gold naturally fell into this same cycle of failed expectations, as the dollar never came into it's "price inflationary" demise.

A number of years ago, "I" began to learn of some smart people about the real political game at hand and how that would, one day, produce the final play in our dollar's timeline. Indeed, you are hiking that trail with us today; us meaning Euro / gold / and oil people. All of us Physical Gold Advocates that have an understanding about gold few Americans have ever been exposed to.

-----------------

Our recent American economic expansion has, all along, actually been the result of a worldly political "will" that supported dollar use and dollar credit expansion so as to buy time for Another currency block to be formed. Without that international support, this decades long dollar derivative expansion could not have taken place. Further, nor would our long term dollar currency expansion produce the incredible illusion of paper wealth that built up within our recent internal American landscape.

-----

The relatively small goods "price inflation" so many gold bugs looked for will be far surpassed and the "hyper price inflation" "I" have been saying is coming is now being "structurally" set free to run.

------

Why "structurally", why now?

For years now, "politically", the dollar system has had no support! Once again, for effect,
"Politically NO", "Structurally Yes"!

For another currency block to be built, over years, the current world economy had to be kept functioning. To this end the dollar reserve system had to be structurally maintained; with its IMF agenda intact, gold polices followed and foreign central bank support all being part of that structure. Truly, the recent years of dollar value was just an illusion. An illusion of currency function and value, maintaining the purpose of holding the world financial and economic system together for a definite timeline. Politically, the world does not hate America; rather they hate the free lifestyle our dollar's illusion value brought us yesterday and today.

Now that the Euro block is passing a point where the Euro currency is viable; this same past dollar support that built American's illusion wealth will now fall away. In it's place we will see the beginnings of a currency war like no other in our time.

-----------------

This very change in structural dollar support is the same change that has been impacting our fed's actions for over a year now. This change is the difference between "my" call for super price inflation and the endless calls past hard money thinkers have made. Their on again / off again goods "price inflation" outlook is based on the same failed analysis that expects price rises because the fed was into another "printing money faster" cycle. I point out that that cycle has come and gone many times without a price inflation anything close to our total, long term, dollar creation.

Further

To this end, I have been calling for a hyer inflation that is being set free to run as a completed Euro system alters Political perceptions and support. That price inflation will be unending and all encompassing. While others call, once again, for a little bit of 5, 10, 15% price inflation, that lasts until the fed can once again get it under control,,,,,,,,, I call for a complete, currency killing, inflation process that runs until the dollar resembles some South American Peso!

Understanding the Western View

Most current brand of American gold bugs all invest along the "hard money socialist" line. They harp on the gold story while placing their money in leveraged bets on gold. Perhaps 10% of their hard money portfolio is in physical and even most of that is in the falsely perceived leverage of lesser hard metals. All the while 90% of their investment is in various leveraged near gold games.

Their story sounds good, but their bets can only pay off if the government statist are able to control the gold market they way it has over the last 30 years. Indeed, if the dollar banking factions were to win this round, we will get another little price inflation cycle and paper gold will, once again, rise a few hundred dollars. The payoff would serve the mines and leveraged paper players at the expense
of long term wealth creation for physical gold advocates. In past cycle form, the statist would send the paper gold price back to the pits.

Fortunately for the majority of world physical gold owners, the hard money socialist game has ended. In fact, it has been on track to fail for a decade or more. To this end, I invest for a full American economic and associated dollar currency breakdown that is reflected in a total revaluation and function of all dollar using business entities. Because governments do and must combat these types of breakups, gold mines and the hard money socialist that guide most of them will fail little better than other investors or companies. They will cry for the government to again create a stable, leveraged paper gold arena so their bets could return to even. The creation of a Euro based World Free Gold physical only market will bar all trading nations from again playing the socialist Western gold game. Physical gold will be the very best holding as all of this comes into play. Virtually all government gold policy will gravitate towards sponsoring citizen gold ownership. Essentially because Europe will have removed the entanglement of modern fiat competition from
said gold markets.

Yes, late comers to this understanding will encounter a true free market, but their buy in price will be at a much higher natural trading level. Present hard money socialist decry this and invoke a call for "official money gold" as the only way governments can go. That will not ever be allowed again
and it guile's them because they need their leveraged gold investments to get them back to even first. Remember, these are the same people that hold free markets on a high plateau as the goal for everyone. Yet, they talk a story of gold control for just a little while longer so adjustments can be
made.

Won't happen! Plan on Americans using inflating dollars as their local transactional currency and Euros as their second currency. All the while calling CPM for their monthly purchase of a world class savings asset; 1oz bid $8,324 - ask $8,388! (right MK,,,,,,smile)

--------------------------

Greenspan will not embark on a dollar building policy again! Even if he changes his mind about leaving. Unlike our past inflation cycles, he has only one act to follow because he must support the internal economic dynamics of this country as its dollar falls from reserve status. There will be no
inflation "cycle" on this go around. The creation of a competing Euro currency block has changed his policy dynamic.

The fed has cut rates below perceived price inflation levels already and will cut again and again; even in the face of real, published, soaring, official statistical CPI. The die has been cast and the game in in process.

--------------

Timing?

We, and I, as physical gold advocates, don't need timing for this position! Timing is for poor, paper traders. We are neither and our solid, long term, one call over several years to hold physical gold will confirm our reasoning. There is no stress for me to own this ancient asset as it is in a good proportion to all my other wealth.

There is no trading an economic system who's currency is ending its timeline. Smart, quick talking players will joke at our expense until fast markets and locked down paper gold positions block their "trading even" move into physical at any relative cheap price. Mine owners will see any near term profits evaporate into a government induced pricing contango that constrains stock equity with forced selling at paper gold prices.

My personal view

They will, one day in the future, helplessly watch their investments fall far behind a world free market price for physical gold. Further into the future, one day, mines will make money on the last thousand per ounce price for gold; only the first $XX,000.00 of price will not be available to them.

-------------

Now that I have more defined mine and our position and views; it's time for us to begin another

"Walk On Solid Ground".

I'll be back as able.

Thanks Michael, Randy,,,,,, all

Walking On Solid Ground


Hiking the Gold Trail: understanding the evolving message of gold.

-----------

Good morning to everyone!

Glad to see so many here. This is a more formal presentation and one of our usual departures from my casual ramblings I brought a few other friends with me to support my thoughts and help guide the hike today. We'll bunch up close when we pause to talk, then stretch out in a line to stay only on the trail. Don't worry, you will all be able to hear me as we walk.

Let's go

My friends and I are Physical Gold Advocates. We own physical outright and do so employing the same reasoning mankind used in owning gold throughout most of history. However, there is a major difference between our perceptions of this historic reasoning and the current Western perceptions so many of you are attuned to. Ours is not a mission to unseat the current academic culture, concerning money teachings; rather it's to present the historic and present day views of the majority of gold owners around the world. Those of simple thought and not of Western education. Plain people that, in bits and pieces, own and use the majority of above ground gold. Whether or not our perception is correct will depend on your ability to apply logic and reasoning.

As we stand here, examine this ancient formation to the left

Most contemporary Western thought is centered around gold being money. That is; gold inherently has a money use or money function; built into it as part of the original creation. This thought presents a picture of ancient man grasping a nugget of gold, found on the ground, and understanding immediately that this is a defined "medium of exchange"; money to buy something with. This simple picture and analysis mostly grew in concept during the banking renaissance of the middle ages and is used to bastardize the gold story to this day. Even the term "money", as it is
used in modern bible interruptions, is convoluted to fit our current understandings.

Much in the same way we watch social understandings of music, literature, culture and dress evolve to fit current lifestyles, so too did gold have a money concept applied to it as it underwent its own evolution in the minds of political men. This is indeed the long running, background story of our Gold Trail; an evolution, not of gold itself, but of our own perceptions of this wealth of ages. A evolving message of gold that is destine to change world commerce as it has never changed before.

Onward my friends

In ancient times there was no concept of money as we know it today. Let me emphasize; "as we perceive money today". Back then, anywhere and everywhere, all things known to people were in physical form. All trade and commerce was physical and direct; barter was how all trade was done.

If one brought a cart to market, loaded with 20 bowls and 20 gold nuggets, he used those physical items to trade for other valued goods. The bowls and gold had different tradable value; as did every other thing at the market. Indeed, gold brought more in trade than bowls. Also true; if a barrel of olive oil was in short supply, it might bring even more in trade than all the gold in the market square.

The understanding, we reach for here, is that nothing at the market place was seen as a defined money value. All goods were seen simply as tradable, barterable items. Gold included. Truly, in time, some items found favor for their unique divisible value, greater worth and ease of transport.
Gems, gold, silver and copper among others, all fit this description. These items, especially and more so gold, became the most tradable, barterable goods and began to exclusively fill that function.

But the main question is: was there money in that market place? Sure, but it was not in physical form. Money, back then and today, was a remembered value in the minds of men. Cumbersome it may have been, but even back then primitive man had an awesome brain and could retain the memory values of thousands of trades. In every case, able to recall the approximate per item value of each thing traded. That value, on the brain, was the money concept we use today.

Eventually gold climbed to the top of in the most tradable good category. Was gold a medium of exchange? Yes, but to their own degree, so were the bowls. Was gold a store of value? Yes, but to a degree, so were dinner plates. Was gold divisible into equal lesser parts to define lesser barter
units? Yes, but to a degree one could make and trade smaller drinking cups and lesser vessels of oil. Perhaps gold became the most favored tradable good because the shear number of goods for good traded made a better imprint on ones memory; the worth of a chunk of gold in trade became the value money unit stored in the brain.

Seeing all of this in our modern basic applications of "money concept", almost every physical item that naturally existed or was produced then also held, to a lesser degree, gold's value in market barter. But most of us would have a hard time remembering a bowls value and thinking of a bowl
as money. The reason this is such a stretch for the modern imagination is because bowls, like physical gold, never contained or were used in our "concept of money". Back then, as also today, all physical items are simple barterable, tradable goods; not of the money concept itself. Their
remembered tradable value was the money.

Gather around

Money, or better said "the money concept", and all physical goods occupy two distinct positions in our universe of commerce and trade. They have an arms length relationship with each other, but reside on different sides of the fence and in different portions of the brain.

For example: say I take a bowl to the mint and place an official government money stamp on the underside. The bowl now is stamped at $1.00. Then I take one tiny piece of gold to the mint; one 290th of an ounce or at today's market a dollar's worth. They stamp that gold as $1.00. Which
physical item would be money? Answer; neither.

Using ancient historic reasoning and the logic of a simple life; the bowl could be taken to the market square and bartered for another good. Perhaps a dinner plate. In that barter trade, we would most likely reach an understanding; that the "bowl for plate trade" imprinted our memory with what a digital, numeric dollar concept is worth. Again, the 1.00 unit was only stamped on the bottom for reference. While the dollar concept is only a rate able unit number to compare value to; like saying a painting is rated from one to ten when judging appearance.

We could do the exact same thing with out 1/ 290th ounce piece of gold as with the bowl above. In the process we again would walk away with the knowledge of what a $1.00 unit of money value was worth in trade. The physical gold itself was not the money in trade; the value of the barter itself created the actual money value relationship. Again. the most important aspect for us to grasp here is this:

----- The use of physical gold in trade is not the use of money in trade. We do not spend or trade a money unit, like the dollar, to define the value of gold and goods: we barter both goods and gold to define the worth of that trade as a remembered association to the dollar money unit. That
remembered worth, that value, is not an actual physical thing. A dollar bill nor an ounce of legal tender gold represent money in physical form. Money is a remembered value relationship we assign to any usable money unit. The worth of a money unit is an endless mental computation of countless barter trades done around the world. Money is a remembered value, a concept, that we use to judge physical trading value. ----------------

Onward

Naturally, for gold to advance as the leading tradable good it had to have a numerical unit for us to associate tradable value with. We needed a unit function to store our mental money value in. In much the same way we use a simple paper dollar today to represents a remembered value only. Dollars have no value at all except for our associating remembered trading value with them. A barrel of oil is worth $22.00, not because the twenty two bills have value equal to that barrel of oil: rather we remember that a barrel of oil will trade for the same amount of natural gas that also relates to those same 22 units. Money is an associated value in our heads. It's not a physical item.

The first numerical money was not paper. Nor was it gold or silver; it was a relation of tradable value to weight. A one ounce unit that we could associate the trading value to. It was in the middle ages that bankers first started thinking that gold itself was a "fixed" money unit. Just because it's
weight was fixed.

In reality, a one ounce weight of gold was remembered as tradable for thousands of different value items at the market place. The barter value of gold nor the gold itself was our money, it was the tradable value of a weight unit of gold that we could associate with that barter value. We do the very same thing today with our paper money; how many dollar prices can you remember when you think a minute?

This political process of fixing money value with the singular weight of gold locked gold into a never ending money vs gold value battle that has ruined more economies, governments and societies than anything. This is where the very first "Hard Money Socialist" began. Truly, to this day they think their ideas are the saving grace of the money world. It isn't now and never was then.

Further along

When investors today speak of using gold coin as their money during a full blown banking breakdown, what are they really speaking of?

In essence, they would be bartering and trading real goods for real goods. The mention of spend their gold money is a complete misconception in Western minds. Many would bring their memories of past buying with then and that is where the trading values would begin. Still, it would take millions of trades before the "market place" could associate a real trading value to the various weight units of gold. It took mankind hundreds? of years to balance the circulation of gold against its barterable value. Only then could a unit weight value become a known money concept. In that process, in ancient times, gold had a far higher "lifestyle" value than it has seen in a thousand years. This value, in the hands of private owners, is where gold is going next.

If you are following closely, now, we can begin to see how easy it is for the concepts of modern money to convolute our value and understanding of gold. It is here that the thought of a free market in physical was formed. Using the relationship of a free physical market in gold, we will be able to relate gold values to millions to goods and services that are currency traded the world over. Instead of having governments control gold's value to gauge currency creation; world opinion will be free to associate the values of barter gold against barter currency. In this will be born a free money concept in the minds of men and governments. A better knowledge and understanding of the value of all things.

Next trip, we will hike the currency trail.
From an associate:

" Some men will stand on a stage, their backs to an economic forest; growing tall and green from fiat dollar use. These men will tell the audience before then that this forest does not exist and they are really in a desert. They say only gold as money will bring rain to this sand. To believe this, one has to accept that 30 years of American fiat dollar use had no part in making this landscape. I say that if the dollar created only a part of this desert, then the Euro and free gold will keep lumber mills employed at least 20 years, no?"

Thanks all

MK, I'll reply about your Harry Browne thought soon (smile).

Discussing the World with Michael Kosares
http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?mnu=news&ptitle=Currency%20Europe&tp=ad_uknews&T=news_storypage99.ht&ad=euro_currency&s=AO72iPxRDRG9sbGFy


Hello MK

I wanted to come back to your last stop here on the GoldTrail to address your points and expose myself to the world. (smile)

I bet you and many hikers think I am tagging all Americans and gold thinkers with this "Hard Money Socialist" label. Ha Ha,,,,, let me slowly turn around so everyone can take a good look what a HMS looks like. Yes, that's right,,,,, I fit the definition completely.

Most of my life I thought gold should be locked into any official currency system so to act as a gauge and controlling factor against socialist tendencies in governments. I studied and in some cases talked to all the prominent thinkers on the subject.

In the late 60s, when Harry B. was living in LA, his pre book views took on quite a following. Me included! Oh, it all seemed so natural then; the eventual breakdown of our misguided economic policies had to, one day, kill the whole dollar printing game! We all thought that "the coming big failure" would drive every governments back to using gold as money; or at least in some version of another gold exchange standard.

However, even then, I had some serious people pointing me in a different direction. You mentioned how people saw Harry's thoughts " " ----- considered him the lunatic fringe back then simply because most people never heard of such a thing---- " "! Ho Ho, you should have seen my reaction
to these other perceived, radical, foreign views I heard?

Truly, Harry's stuff seemed so much more real, so much more the "American Way", that it just had to work. Well, it did and we have whole libraries full of historical scrip and economic writer's papers to chronicle his correctness. But, you know, I also looked back at these other guys explanation of things and they were every bit correct too,,,,, the effects were the same. Then as the 70s ended and the 80s ran on, their much more longer term understanding really took hold and left all other gold / currency explanations in the dirt. True, all the rest of the hard money crowd gained a little with each gold cycle high, but were also shot down with each cycle drop. The trouble is that historic process is a time consuming afair (smile) and most of the younger boys and girls that come here don't have a full hands on perspective to how we got here. Current dogma has a way of leaving out important turning points that are really needed to be factored in. Hell, a few decades of cycles became so regular in our mind set that a whole industry was born, explaining why cycle investing works (smile). In time I came to understand that there really was a long term, singular move, evolving along as a political play at work here. The last decade only served to underscore it all.

The early 90s Gulf war spike in gold should have been the final revenge for us bugs. Can you imagine,,,,,, war in the middle eastern oil fields,,,,,,, hundreds of well burning and gold gets shot down?? I was already 80% in my associates camp of thinking by then and that spike down pulled my other 20% right in. I knew then that the whole story was changing on political grounds and was not going to follow the Mise path.

My typical hard money shared long held belief, back then, was always:

----"Gold is the only official money of the world and will return to these roots one day"-------- and -----" some world wide financial dislocation will drive all governments back to this position"-----!!!!

It wasn't going to happen, no matter what, short of nuclear war. All we had to do was look around and see how people the world over were attached to using fiat currencies. The economic system itself was morphing into new ground as world trade learned to function very efficiently with fiat
digital settlement. And that's something the 70s crowd said could never happen. That was how many years ago?

A lot of the Mise crowd tried to point out that ---- " hey, this is all very good but if you were on a gold system this economic game would be all the more better" ----! Ha Ha, no one cared,,,,,, why risk what was already in process. Even the third world didn't want to hear it. They figured that any return to a hard money system would harked back to a time they remembered well. These guys suffered during the early century and no one was going to tell them that the gold standard wasn't the fault. The US, is today and was then, robbing them blind but the situation seemed, to them, that this new dollar standard was building them up. Looking at it all,,,,, we robbed the Japan life style standards the most. All to buy us an almost free standard and they loved it.

When it came to using fiat money in our modern era, it made little difference what various inflation rates were in countries around the world; 50%, 100% 1,000%,,,,,, they went right on playing with the same pesos. There have been countless third world examples of this dynamic, if only we look around. Mike, look at what happened in Russia after they fell,,,, the Ruble stayed in use and function with 6,000% inflation. My god they still use it now.

No,,,,,,, my guys are dead on the money with respect to the political dynamic that's playing out. The world is heading towards a huge financial / currency crack up, but it won't work out with gold coming back into the money game. This very long term transition is playing on a move away from
dollar domination with Europe preparing to suffer less than us by pulling in as many other political trading blocks as they can.

When you look at who they are reaching for; every one of these blocks wants gold moving higher to shelter their dollar trading losses. None of them expect to unload dollar reserves because our end time trade deficit won't permit it. They can't just send the dollars to each other, buying their
own goods that would never exhaust the external dollar float. Hell they now have their own money to do trade with, the Euro.

The game is to let the US economy suffer from its own bloated expansion by moving slowly away from supporting foreign dollar settlement with CB storage. This is more than enough to end the dollars timeline as we are already stretched to the leverage limit. They know that Greenspan has but one policy to use and that will be super printing. He is doing it now, right on que!

The ensuing domestic price inflation will waste away all buying power of dollars overseas. This is where they must install a free market in gold that ends international confidence in the current gold fractional reserve game. This is the "what for" of Britain moving itself and it's gold operation into the Euro arena. Once safely there, or there in initiative, the ECB and BIS could cash out England's gold
liabilities without crashing London's banks.

Mind you, this is all happening while Western style "Hard Money Socialists" are defending their stance by saying the Euro is just another fiat. Ha! These are the same guys that, throught the 90s, put every dine in expensive gold stocks and watched dollar currency inflation drive the dow up a
trillion points while political actions killed their leveraged gold plays. Now they will refuse to buy physical when political will is about to impact this sector and they will most likely stand by while a Euro based dynamic starts another economic surge later.

Truly, reasoning and logic is all about your point below: "it is", Mike.


Mk, you mentioned:

------
Europe will be no more aggressive than it needs to be. As a casual political observer, I believe that this policy is a mistake that forces Europe to play the inflation game along with the United States, and that is not the way I would have played the game given the opportunity. However, I'm not the
one calling the shots in Europe. I am an American businessman and investor and in that capacity I am not so much interested in the world as I'd "like it to be" but as "it is." I'm sure my European counterparts feel the same way.-----------

Right Mike, your last part is like Another said about the forest growing anyway. The fact that it worked with fiat is the way it happened,,,,, "it is"!

To address your point: well, they are awfully dog gone aggressive now. Note that they didn't make any attempt to match our post crash rates with a larger drop in their own. That has placed then in a very pro-active dollar warring position now. I'm sure Greenspan is smoke-en over this break away. Its built a major carry proposition against the dollar with it and the Euro has to gain on this. Here is an item from your News feed:

--------------------
http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?mnu=news&ptitle=Currency%20Europe&tp=ad_uknews&T=news_storypage99.ht&ad=euro_currency&s=AO72iPxRDRG9sbGFy

Currency Europe
10/05 13:06 Dollar May Fall vs Euro, Yen; U.S. Unemployment Seen Rising
By Chris Gothard
London, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar, little changed, may decline against the euro and the yen on expectations a report will show U.S. unemployment climbed to the highest level in more than four years, more evidence the nation is headed for a recession. -------------------
\`\`We expect unemployment to rise,'' said Rod Davidson, who helps oversee about $1 billion as head of fixed-income securities at Murray Johnstone Asset Management in Glasgow. \`\`Everyone is watching for the slowdown in consumer spending.'' He expects the dollar to decline to 96 cents per
euro by year-end, and recently sold U.S. Treasury bonds in favor of European government debt. ----
Since Sept. 11, U.S. Treasuries maturing in one year and more returned 2.05 percent in local currency terms, according to Bloomberg indexes that take into account reinvested interest. For a European investor, those returns are reduced to 1.79 percent because of the dollar's drop against the euro in that period. ----------------

-------------------------------------------------

Add a,,,,,,, solid rate difference on top of these figures,,,,,,,,, factor in a "beggar thy neighbor" who is going to survive this economic war between Japan and US ,,,,,,,,; and europe's thrust is major! I fully well expect Europe to sell into any dollar gold market spikes,,,, now,,,,, so as to hold the level stedy,,,,,,,in an effort to inflate paper and discredit our gold market. Eventually they will move to create a rift between physical dollar gold prices and dollar derivatives prices. The call will go out
that American gold does not reflect what's happening to our Greenspan dollar policy,,,,, real US price inflation,,,,,,, and is a fraud.

You know, the US wants and needs a higher gold asset price now and I bet they are confounded to find a way to achieve it. We are stuck in a situation where we will ship a good portion a cheap prices first. We spent a decade or so playing this gold game for better oil pricing and economic
dominance; now a higher dollar price would hand our banks a trillion dollar derivatives loss if it rises. It just kills them because the Euro banking establishment would simply cash our all the dollar based gold derivatives into euro settlement and gain as gold spikes and builds an ever larger asset base for all the ECBMBs.

I have to laugh at all these jokers that keep trying to understand the ECB gold policy as some sort of currency backing similar to years past. It just flies right past them that the ECB wants gold as an dollar replacing asset, not local money backing. For your European clients, they would be in the best of all worlds it they buy gold now. Their system is almost making rising gold a law so as to buffer domestic dollar exchange rate loses.

Mk, you also wrote:

-------- Of course, this is precisely what happened in the 1970s. Harry Browne made the same argument back then -- that the $35 gold price was both an institutional fixture and institutional fiction. Europe took advantage of that situation by reclaiming a substantial gold reserve. When the
London gold pool (both de jure and overt) broke down at the $35 price, the devaluation (both de jure and and overt) quickly followed. Additional formal gold sales proceeded from there from both the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury.

Since today the gold price is both an institutional fixture and institutional fiction much the same process is in motion at present -- only de facto and covert. Are you suggesting a similar result? And with the euro present and accounted for, will it lead to a new world order? -----------


The difference today is that the whole worldly financial, economic and currency structure evolved to service a much more fast paced dynamic. Simply put, we cannot go back to not using digital settlement again. If we are to use our trading efficiencies we must embrace fiat currency use,,,,,,,,, and all its evils. This is what was recognized as we were placed on the road to high priced gold. Kind of like high priced oil has been factored into our equation,,,,,, so too will a rising gold price be seen as the price we pay for modern operation. Of course, just as those that don't have oil must pay to play, and gladly do so,,,,,, those that don't have real gold when the tables turn will have to pay to keep up.

Back when Harry wrote his early views, gold was largely a physical market. Let's see, were there futures in the late 60s. Nope, didn't think so (smile). Gold was largely a government transfer thing with private players outside the US moving a relatively tiny amount of gold. The real story in the 70s was in how much gold the truly big operators couldn't get, even at those oh so high prices. The little American brought his K rands , gold stocks and post 1975 futures and thought he was doing something big. In retrospect, gold was dead in the water compared to where it should have gone. The dollar faction never really stopped controlling it.

Today, it's not the government pricing policy that in jeopardy, it's the very market itself and this change will break not only the price fiction but the institution also.

Ok, guess I went on enough here. I sure hope everyone can overlook my english mistakes in those last two posts? More so in all my posts? (smile) Talk later my friend

Gold on the trail.

Hello Again.

While we watch world events agrivate the markets, the GoldTrail becomes an ever safer place to be.

With US bombs working overtime, we may as well get used to living, talking and investing in a world of disorder. It seems this particular period isn't going away any time soon. However, there is another dislocation on the horizon; once we get past this war phase, by then a real economic / currency transition may be well under way.

I wanted to further discuss a closing portion of MKs post, here on the trail.

----- Since today the gold price is both an institutional fixture and institutional fiction much the same process is in motion at present -- only de facto and covert. Are you suggesting a similar result? And with the euro present and accounted for, will it lead to a new world order? ------- I think we may have come to a new Trailhead -- perhaps one that looks vaguely familiar, but then again perhaps something totally different. I am convinced you are correct that the Europeans believe that there is a certain historical inevitability to the dollar's demise and there is no need to hasten the process. ---- The real controversy in the weeks and months to come will revolve around what this
might mean to both European and American savers, equity investors and gold owners. -----------

-------------------------------------------------

In MKs quote above, he was concluding a comparison to our early seventies gold market and its predicted change as seen by Harry Browne. He also considered the European perspective and what it will mean for us. That "us" is you, me and our friends in Europe.

My thoughts:

I made a point in my last talk that: ---- In time I came to understand that there really was a long term, singular move, evolving along as a political play at work. The last decade only served to underscore it all. --------

Within this evolving political play, gold is but one portion of the pie. For us gold advocates, "how this portion fits in", is the most important segment of this economic transition in progress. In time that question will become the most all consuming topic on gold forums.

If you have spent any time at all with mine or my associates thoughts, you may have come away with a perception that these past decades did not contain gold cycles. Indeed, all of these fluctuations could be understood as one long, determined, singular process; a competitive political process of taking the world off the old dollar standard. As in MKs thought above; most European planers realized long ago that there had to be some inevitable "play out" or "wear out" of the dollar's mechanics. Especially when its whole linkage to gold was broken; making the dollar an
international medium that only expressed the political management for one nation: the US!

Modern Euro Zone thinkers, today, are even more so aware of what their new currency initiative will mean in the time ahead. As much as we Americans turn a deaf ear to such logical discussion, there is no avoiding the fact that every currency that lived had an end. This fate is being hastened for our dollar even before full Euro use is established. We have but to look and see that "safe haven" currency buying has dramatically shifted to favor the Euro in this present time of warfare; something that was not recently the case for any other major national currency.

The historical fact, that fiat currencies end, is all the more true as modern economies probe the useful limits of fiat currency systems. We have pointed out many times that the dollar has a definite timeline and the equation that controls that line is linked to "political use". Where once hard metal backing or at least "hard style money" management determined a fiat's value, modern economics seem destine to morph even the next "world money" into the same process. This is part of the "why for" Europe's ECB built its gold policy as it did. In addition to replacing the huge hole a fallen dollar will create, their "non money" gold assets will establish a world class commodity link that oil
producers and other natural resource rich nations can use to deflect "new world order" building by the next zone of nations. A return of gold back to it's ancient real purpose and use in a value ratio that reflects the worth of the world's created and owned wealth in something other than national paper currency. This will send gold on a long term run over decades. Creating an international asset that forces the comparison of all economic orders, and the national currencies they use, against each other; negating the need to reinstate a Western policy of artificially controlling gold values for the currencies benefit.

-------------------

The US placed its money into this current equation in 1971. Then it failed to accept the internal price inflation that over printing its money demanded and a remarking of it's gold reserves would expose to the world. Once off the last possible connection to a gold exchange standard, the dollar became a modern political tool. Little more than a derivative of value that depended upon what it could buy within our American borders. While this will be the fate of every new currency in our modern world, the US was politically and structurally unprepared for this shift in dynamics. We left our currency in this international pot, subject to every bit of unknown economic evolution that would come along. Because we could not walk away from the free lunch it brought us, that evolution dynamic is now upon us. The price we will now pay is the complete loss of dollar utility.

We managed this threat with help from our Euro friends; somehow thinking they enjoyed and wanted our fleecing their lifestyle to the same degree we did it to the rest of the world. Their cooperation, we will find out, was but a structural policy that brought time; time for a dollar
replacement to be made.

Our ability to print and ship ever larger numbers of dollars overseas, against our local purchasing power alone, demanded a gold relationship to prove the dollar derivative's value. While implementing this policy, we morphed our internal goods production base so as to further decrease its ability to match the flood of dollars we were creating. From local manufacturing to services we moves, all the while our leaders and economists told us; "don't worry, noone is watching,,,, and if they are they are too stupid to understand it all". Herein is where gold fit into the pie. Herein our newly fiat currency became a tool with a timeline. A currency with an end.

While hard money historians, to the man, clamor for a return to honest government and a dollar backed with gold; they leave out an important step in the process that history says will never be skipped. Once a nation embarks down a road of inflating its currency for local political use, the cast is set for a constant redenominating of the money unit; that is "real bad" price inflation. However, modern economic evolution has presented an even more profound reply. Once a nation embarks down a road of inflating its currency for international political use, the cast is set for the world to find said fiats useful limits, then drop it from use; that is super price inflation as a result of fiat replacement. To this end we come.

--------------------

The gold market, today, is composed of a relatively tiny physical sector with an all consuming paper component surrounding and dwarfing the standing stocks. This relationship is fine and well as it served the international community with a way to hedge dollar positions with price rises in gold. It worked as long as this "paper gold" float had credibility; not to be confused with delivery credibility. In our modern dollar gold markets, derivative gold investors need only have faith that their position "could and would" deliver a gold "price matching" quality. As long as the dollar remained the world settlement reserve currency one need not have access to real gold to generate hedged buying power, paper gold would do this for you. Whether the gold price moved or no, a position and faith was all we needed to continue dollar use.

This kind of position has grown in the final decade of dollar use. In order to float ever larger numbers of international dollars, the paper gold float had to expand with it. Our dollar was very much hyper inflated as it was used in a final act of world economic leverage; "political use" that drained the last bit of "leverage value" from a failing currency system. To this end, the "paper gold"
markets were matched, point to point, with international dollar inflation.

-----------------------------

As we proceed with this act, the dollar will come to be seen more and more as "just another currency" rather than the world's reserve settlement money. We see today the makings of this move as national blocks move in this direction. England, Russia, China and South Africa are thinking more and more in terms of using Another currency; in a percentage that more reflects a realistic ratio of their trade flows. Soon oil, debt and all world settlement will be done more so in this same ratio. Soon, investors will match their fiat needs and savings plans so as to be denominated in Euro positions; again equal to a more worldly economic exposure.

While, at first, not completely replacing the dollar on a world trading scale, this initial shift will have a dramatic impact on the use, need and overall function of our current paper gold markets as expressed in dollar terms. In order to replace the loss of our international dollar demand and its impact on domestic economic and financial structure, the US fed has and will begin a structural currency inflation that builds upon an already overextended base of world dollar liquidity. This incredible currency expansion will break out into the open with real price inflation as never before witnessed in the US. In turn, foreign holders of dollar based assets will, not only, demand price performance of their "paper gold" hedges, even as they are compelled to shift a larger portion of their asset bases into Euro positions.

The ECB will not only be forcing a higher return to Euro holders, they will also be promoting a shift away from the US method of hedging currency risk. Moving their quarterly marking to the market of gold assets to using a local Euro Zone spot physical price; a price that will prove to out run the dollar "paper gold" market's ability to keep up. Such a play will emphasize "physical gold" positions for hedging as opposed to "paper gold" positions. The latter will become an obvious useless play as investors ratio their exposure into physical and glut the "paper gold" market with no longer needed, unwanted dollar positions. An action that forces a discount upon a market physically unprepared to match real gold against a decade of super inflated paper supply.

In the end analysis; the dollar will suffer an ever more negative reallocation of assets in a snowball effect that trends investors away from dollar use and settlement. As dollar price inflation roars, and physical gold demand soars; the dollar gold markets will completely fail their past hedging purpose as they become locked into a political cash settlement mode. A mode that forces an ever expanding discount against spot physical trading in Europe and the world.

---------------

The new world order MK mentioned above will, in time, be seen as simply a redefinition of currency use and values. As seen in a historic scope of human affairs; the world has always been on the brink of a new world order. Perhaps better said: the old world order has never stopped
changing. (smile)

thanks all

Question from Beneath a Tonne of Yellow Metal:
FOA, with respect to your comment below (which fell on me like a tonne of yellow metal), let me ask a question or two:

FOA: "The ECB will not only be forcing a higher return to Euro holders, they will also be promoting a shift away from the US method of hedging currency risk. Moving their quarterly marking to the market of gold assets to using a local Euro Zone spot physical price; a price that will prove to out run the dollar "paper gold" market's ability to keep up. Such a play will emphasize "physical gold" positions for hedging as opposed to "paper gold" positions. The latter will become an obvious useless play as investors ratio their exposure into physical and glut the "paper gold" market with no longer needed, unwanted dollar positions. An action that forces a discount upon a market physically unprepared to match real gold against a decade of super inflated paper supply."


MK: I think I might understand where you are going with this. But let me ask you just to be sure: Do you foresee "using a local Euro Zone spot physical price" as you put it, (and I interpret that to mean Europe pricing gold in euros independent of the dollar price) as a means to breaking the bullion banks' grip on the price of gold? Let's just deal with that piece of the puzzle before moving on. In such a scenario, what would happen for example if natural supply and demand took the price to EU500), while the bullion banks through derivative selling held the price at US$290? Let me throw in one more ingredient: The exchange rate between the dollar and euro remained within 90% of what it is now. Is this even theoretically possible?

PIZZA,,,, Bronco's,,,,,, Tonne of Yellow Metal,,,, and USAGOLD: Ha Ha,,, a gold advocates dream come true (ssssmile)

Background for everyone

All through out this period bullish gold traders have lost their shirts trying to bet on the price of gold. It wasn't until around 1995? or 1996? that these same traders even began suspecting that the price of gold was manipulated. As years turned into decades, hard money traders plunged theirsavings into our gold markets as up and down cycles drained their leveraged gold wealth. All the while thinking that the highs and lows, that were killing them, were just the ebb and flow of paper prices representing the fundamental demand and supply of physical gold. With Mises like faith they knew, someday, the currency inflation that has driven our financial markets and economies upward, would meet its end; finally taking their leveraged gold position to the top. It didn't happen then and it won't happen now; not as they are playing it! Period.

Remember, this writing is coming from one of the longest running (now ex.) "Hard Money Socialist" anyone has ever seen!

Without mentioning any names, I can remember when some of today's most avid supporters of the manipulation cause were shouting down, not only Another's voice of reason to buy physical, but anyone else that suggested manipulation or a "political thrust" was controlling the paper price.

Today, countless gold people around the world point out that gold is a manipulated item. While being on the right track, they are still using the wrong perception to grasp the dynamics of these markets. This lack of perception is what keeps them from positioning themselves and other gold
people correctly: positioned to gain wealth when a stake is finally driven in the heart of this paper monster.

The efforts by most are focused in one direction; to once again make our paper gold markets reflect the real rarity and actual fundamental value of physical gold bullion. While my heart, support and courage goes out to all gold bulls that strive for this end, it's chances of happening are the same as having government moneys return to being backed with gold: zero chance!

This grip on physical prices, that paper trading has, is only going to be changed because dollar gold derivatives no longer work. Not because some form of private lawsuit, world disaster or private coin buying is going to redirect investment flows. Only an official government change away from supporting their currency with paper pricing will do it,,,,, and don't expect the USA to be at the forefront of this move.

---------------

Lost in all the confusion is the distinction between investing in the price of gold and investing in gold itself. Perhaps 90% of all the investing in today's worldwide, dollar settled, gold market is done in this first way mentioned. Yes, the market is structured, contractually, to settle in gold. However, in practice, in norm, and in past legal precedent, it is accepted that paper gold trading is meant to only capture the price movements in gold while ceding, what could be, controlling physical trades and
their price setting function to other market areas.

Obviously, this is the way it all started, years ago, with the physical trading and its fundamentals dominating the lesser paper trading. But the market evolved with the paper contractual trading becoming 100 or more times the size of the physical side. But everyone already knows all this,
right?

What doesn't seem to be obvious is the "why for" the paper market grew so large. It grew to dominate because world wide dollar expansion reached its "non hedged" peak. In other words, the dollar's timeline was ending as its ability to produce non price inflationary economic gains came into
sight

In order to push dollar holdings further, international players needed and purchased "paper financial hedges" to balance their risk. Within their total mix of derivative hedges were found "paper gold price hedges"; modern gold derivatives. The important thing to remember is that these positions are not and never will be used to demand physical gold. They are held to buffer financial and currency risk associated with holding any form of dollar based asset. To work these items don't need to really perform "dollar price movements" in the holders favor as much as they are present in the portfolio to act as insurance stickers.

In that truth, these paper gold positions act like FDIC insurance at our banks. It can and will manage only a small determined portion of bank runs,,,,, not a full scale failure of the banking system. In a real full banking failure we would all get, perhaps, 80% of our covered $100,000 and 10% of the rest.

The same is true for these gold position's performance; real gold delivery along with true price performance, matching real bullion trading, would be only for the very few. For that matter, an actual functioning paper gold marketplace would be for the very few, too! But, in the same way a bank account owner understands the credibility of FDIC insurance when times are good; the international dollar asset owner will not grasp that modern paper gold hedges cannot be allowed to work until after a real serious price inflationary run begins.

For the first time in this portion of the dollar's timeline and our lifetimes, such an inflation is about to show its face!

==================

While so many of our gold bulls salivate at the prospects of some player calling for delivery and driving the gold derivatives market to the moon; it ain't gona happen! Our world of dollar based gold derivatives has grown so large and become so integrated into supporting (hedging)
international dollar assets, the central banks will band together to crush any delivery drive.

This is in the ECBs intrest as I will explain in a moment.

If some big player said he was going to take 100 million ozs out of the paper gold market, the Central Bank systems would just order him to trade out for liquidation only and go to the cash market to buy his gold. Don't think I'm confusing Comex positions and their rules as being different from the rest of the world gold market. What works on comex works everywhere when the system is at risk. The controlling governments, who's domain Bullion Banks reside in, would, could and will force those holders of bank busting positions to simply cash out for the good of their
system.

By the way; not only does a liquidation market send baby gold bulls running to sell, also, the BBs would be selling enough additional paper to temporally send gold down $100 bucks so our boy would trade out with a little less cash (smile). Then he would find an opposite "premium" spike in
the cash markets, waiting for his order.

I hope my little dose of reality drives some sense into our gold community. This is the reason Another says only fools try to buy their gold all at once on the paper markets. "NOONE" is going to exercise their "corner" until the dollar based gold system is changed.

-------------

OK, thanks for waiting, MK, I'm getting to your point. (smile)

Mike, while I'm writing this, I see gold selling off (silver more so). Once again, we see where the paper based trading has plenty of selling power and completely dominates the physical fundamental markets. How may postulated, even just a few years ago, that with the fed expanding the money
supply by a year to date "one trillion"; that paper gold could not reflect this inflation? This only further confirms that this form of market "hedge" is failing to function for its owners. Changing are coming, my friend, changes are coming! Back to the story:

==================

Paper gold derivatives became a major force in allowing this last, end time, demand for dollars and subsequent surge in it's value. This is why Another said it would run way up, even while being inflated, before the end would come.

Only now are we coming to a point where theory meets practice as Alan Greenspan now is and must hit the presses. This forced printing inflation, currently happening, is the very precursor to a lower dollar exchange rate, rising real price inflation and the very first destructive test of paper gold derivative hedges. As price inflation rises the US will protect its own banks and the short paper gold portion of these positions they created. They will sell all the paper gold they can in order to stop these hedging positions from functioning and breaking their writers.

On the physical side, the US wants and needs a higher price as they ship real gold commitments to help balance our sinking ship. So, the dollar supporting paper gold position we have sold for years will now block our ability to gain some ground with high US gold reserve prices.

In turn, Euro factions will also sell into the paper gold dollar system to help further discredit its hedging function in the face of dollar price inflation. Now to the good part:

----------------

If you are a major international dollar asset holder, watching this evolving transition, how would you act? Remember, not only is paper gold not rising to reflect real dollar price inflation, even physical gold cannot react because the dollar based market, as it currently functions, keeps physical subject to paper discovered prices.

With the world dollar gold markets completely locked from rising and performing their portion of a hedge function for your portfolio,,,,,,, because, if they rose trillions would be lost by the writers,,,,,,, what asset based currency would you escape into.

How about a currency that wants you to redirect your fiat hedging to using outright physical gold instead of paper gold leverage? A currency, with a stated free gold pricing policy, that will allow your physical hedge to function in place of that locked dollar gold market; and function in a
currency supporting way.


They say:We understand that there will be an inflationary transition form this dollar world because we, ourselves, must absorb a certain portion of all the past created dollar inflation. A portion of pain we and the world must all bear in order to economically get pass this period. But, at least, we offer a position in the wealth of ages to reflect this financial loss as it is manifest in price inflation.

We will allow and support any physical gold Euro price rise to balance this action.


--------------------------


Mike,

the leverage today will be in a physical gold position, not any other form of gold ownership. By accumulating physical gold today, we are truly walking in the footsteps of giants; advancing with them as they work thru this singular, long term political move. Truly, the oil producers also fully understand and appreciate this position.


Yes, I think it is theoretically possible to see physical Euro gold priced very high while traditional American paper gold markets become cheap, non functioning, cash settlement shadows of world spot gold values. In the near future, there will be no form of arbitrage between physical gold and this failed , crushed dollar gold market because it will only allow cash settlement. While a

US physical gold free market will be locally encouraged, it will most likely simply be a shadow function of Euro Gold prices. Besides, politically, unless we once again stop all gold ownership and or implement exchange controls,,,,,, all gold buying money would head to europe. Besides again, politically, a Euro based free market will end all fictions of gold's true value anyway. (This is my private understanding or scoop, if you will) I also expect a European gold coin to become real usable legal tender (not a collector item) and be named the "EuroLand"". Again, a barter asset that is taxed when used. Just as we have sales taxes and excise taxes; gold coins used outside an investment realm would be taxed. (again, this is but the shadow of an evolving down the road position as I can best grasp it)


I also fully well expect that most world gold mine production will be forced to ship gold into the leftovers of the dollar cash settlement paper market until the Bullion Banking system is made whole on their physical side. In adjunct to this, the ECB and BIS will play a major roll in cashing out failed paper gold positions for certain clients. Cashing out in Euros, that is.


A US workout to cover its failed paper gold position will most likely be using gold industry profits. It could be done via "windfall tax legislation", plain tax or part of any variety of emergency financial arrangement. All built in order to allow our current gold reserves to be repriced at higher world levels and help our dollar stay somewhere in the next currency system. Considering the size of the failure, real gold will outperform any and all investments once this all gets started. However, we should not be naive and not expect some serious taxes of our own on bullion sales. Still, only just enough so as to keep currency tender protected from being supplanted with illegal gold use. Illegal in that too high a rate and everyone would use gold in barter and stopped paying their capital gains taxes all together.


Dollar hyperinflation and super high gold prices are closer than many think.


MK, while I think you have always understood our thrust, if this post is sinking into the readers understanding,,,,, the words should be jumping off the page at them. Let's hope so.


Now, I think I will do some gardening and also have a pizza later. Sounded too good to pass up! (smile).


thanks

I hope to later comment on the good words of Mr. Strauss.

At the Trail Head parking lot

I'm here to post a notice that another guest speaker will soon be talking somewhere on the trail. I think this one will be covering fiats or moneys, not completely sure?

(leaning against my car, while talking to a few day hikers)

After yesterday's awful writing I went into my back property to hide and do some gardening. Some of the guys that help me out came over and dug in. It wasn't long before they, once again, started telling me what to do and, in a weekly ritual, I fired the whole bunch! By now they know this is my usual banter and just kept right on working,,,, and still telling me where and how things should be planted! The truth is, after all these years I'm still learning from them. Looking at the whole situation; I know I can talk better than they can garden, but I also know they can garden better than I can write! So, there is a certain symmetry ,,,,,, somewhere in this scheme of human affairs. It requires us all to put up with the other's weakness; especially if we want the other's understandings.

(pulling a cloth from my pocket and cleaning my glasses while talking)

On most parts of this Trail, I could walk with my eyes closed; while in other areas I would need six maps and two GPSs units just to know north! Right now, I can tell ya what's most likely out there, but in those strange areas; not really sure?

Take this Euroland gold coin thing? My guess is we won't see this anytime soon. I suspect it will be something like a K-Rand, with no marked currency denomination, but different in that it will be a hybrid legal tender. If you look here in the US, gold coins are somewhat a currency as they stand.
Just like IBM stock, real estate and most any other asset, we just have to sell it for currency first; pay our taxes and then use the money to buy something. The process only becomes illegal if you use the stock, land or gold to trade directly for something and don't pay your taxes.

Mr. Strauss pointed out that the current trend in motion is that all VAT taxes are being lifted or phased out on gold trading. Eventually, most of the world will have only some form of capital gains taxes on gold. This is fine and is bringing gold into focus as the one and only metal asset the official sector is trying to work with. But I think there is more to it than this.

As I said many times; Europe it looking to bring gold back into use as a very tradable asset. Perhaps "the most very tradable asset" but still outside the fiat money context. They want to keep the government's and socialist's hands off gold and its market function so it will serve everyone as a
savings medium. But, they also want it to gain as a trading medium so the combination of the two will create immense demand.

To gain in the "use department" I suspect we will see some push to drop all gains taxes on gold used in official coin (Euroland) form. In place of that, there will be some form of excise tax charged on payments / trades done using these gold coins. Most likely, you will have a choice of paying
completely in gold or Euros but not a combination of both. Probably, gold will be used for large purchases because gold will carry a very high price by then. And too, 1 gram coins will be the norm; being the size of our one ounce now, but with alloys. I doubt gold will ever be used in regular store / retail sales. In other words, I could go into my bank and use 50 Eurolands containing, say one ounce fine gold each, and pay off my $200,000 mortgage; minus some 15% excise tax on the deal? I could probably do the same thing with regular bullion, too, but would pay a somewhat higher gains tax rate; instead of the lower excise tax.

Anyway, this is all in the "for what it's worth area". Go ahead and take your hike,,,, I will be here giving the car a tune-up and changing the oil when you return. Then I want to talk some more about the words of Mr. Strauss (smile).

Continuing from my last talk:


(returning to the trailhead parking lot: walking along the road with a few Gold Trail hikers I ran into along the way)

Boy, I wish those other day hikers would have returned from their walk before I had to leave. Sure could have used a ride to the auto store. Who would have thought I couldn't get my oil filter off? It seems the more we advance our so-called "modern lifestyle", the more complicated simple things become. Now it takes a $10, special angled grip wrench just to undo a simple filter and the darn thing broke just when I needed it!!!!!

You guys probably think this is all normal? But, I tell ya, all this complicated engineering only works when nothing goes wrong; the fella that designed that oil filter never thought somebody (me) would accidentally push a little more than needed; breaking the wrench and causing a problem that
stopped the whole car from running.

(now done with the car, sitting on a log with the guys)

You know, the gold market was put together the same way as my car: over the decades, a whole bunch of financial engineers each designed their own little part of the mechanics. Each one of them structured their little part to work perfectly as it functioned in the overall operation of the engine.

These fellas did exactly what their boss told them to do; make your part work and don't worry about all the rest. In truth, this dynamic works fantastically in a mechanical environment; devoid of organic imperfections. But, apply this kind of design into an economic function and sooner or later you're asking for all hell to break lose!

You see, a fuel pump won't look over its shoulder to see if the gas tank really has all the liquid the dash board fuel gauge say it has. Such a mechanical system, as an overall part of the engine function, will keep right on running until the very end! Now understand that..... if a person, emotions and all, was running that pump, he would eventually see what's what and go running down the hall screaming "we're almost out of gold,,,,, errr, I mean gas!

Let's take a hike:

You know, modern financial engineering incorporates all the physical factors of "just in time delivery" management and labels it "just in time dispersion of risk". In other words: they try to take all the perfect workings of a mechanical operation and replicate it into financial dealings. But, financial instruments, while understood by us as being paper bonds, stocks and bank accounts, are actually completely organic! They are, like money, really concepts of value we hold in our head; not oil filters or fuel pumps we hold in our hands. The "worth" of things is a "value" we mentally
create thru countless interactions with each other as we go thru the day: interactions we call "the markets".

Onward

It's no accident of nature that our world monetary structure embraced derivative expansion as it has over the last ten or twelve years. I think we can say that this modern creation of risk management began around 1988 or so. ( It's funny, but I remember living in San Diego and reading a paper about a gold company called Barrick that just started only a few years earlier?)

The record of derivative evolution meshes seamlessly with the recent need for supportive dollar currency measures; a strategy of maintaining a failing system that was ending earlier than expected. Truly, a decade ago, noone was going to carry the dollar any further, waiting on the endless delays of Euro creation, without some way to hedge risk. We had hit the end of the dollar's timeline to early; we had missed the mark.

The US could not physically save the dollar, then, with gold backing or the production and sale of real goods. In the course of all the previous dollar expansion, the gross liabilities of taking dollar asset conversion into anything real, and originated locally in the US, would have made us economic slaves to the world for decades. The only answer was to let the dollar kill itself while you create an illusion of risk dispersion in the form of derivative protection; a form of backing if you will. With this "illusion of risk dispersion" in hand, called a derivative hedge, the world currency system and its denominated assets, continued on. This "just in time risk management" was and is adopted into every present day currency that carried the dollar as reserve backing. This includes all the old Euro moneys and the Swiss and British etc.. Thus, in time, derivative use supplanted IMF protocols and SDR functions; sidestepping the whole basic structure of controls built upon the old dollar based system.

This derivative buildup has effectively removed US fed policy from being a controlling factor in dollar use and expansion. Gone were the days when the Fed could force everyone to disinflate with us. Today, if we slow our money printing, the outside liabilities would crush our banking and ,therefore, our economic way of life.

It's no wonder that Alan Greenspan has commented so often on the need to control derivatives yet has no workable plan to counter their function. Truly this dynamic was created to counter his function and few can understand this! In effect, the dollar was placed on a one way street that required it to be inflated into infinity. All as a means of protecting dollar originators; the US banking system. Dollar leverage, that is actually US liabilities, is now built up endlessly. This all points to a nonstop, end time need for an uncontrollable inflationary expansion by our fed.

Randy S, over in the tower at USAGOLD, has shown us a complete record of this current era of dollar creation. While others were waiting for a "little bit of 6%, 7% or 8% inflation" to show its head, are given a weekly guide of this new Fed policy agenda and its dilemma. An almost endless acceleration of reserve creation that, strangely enough, coincided with each increase in the confidence that the Euro was for real.

Today, our fed is confronted with a daunting task. The Sept. tragedy served to force its hand and show its true policy in the open and the risk that is driving it. We as consumers welcomed a derivative driven dollar expansion, the stock market assets it produced and the better lifestyle it brought us. We even thanked the political will that made this so; not knowing that the seeds of leverage that produced our illusionary gains were handcuffing our ability to ever stop the process. We are now learning that managing a dollar economy and the "derivative risk" that brought it, all works very well. In our first real test of "just in time risk management" our Fed is and will provide buying power to gobble up any and all risk, "just in time" and without end.

With this the decade long cries for comparison of our "US free market driven economy" and "Europe's terrible socialist polices" fall silent. It seems that when our "free market" created assets are threatened to be exposed as an illusion of value, Americans embrace any and every form of government socialistic bailout known to man. Perhaps, our much exampled form of a "free market driven economy" was little more than "free as long as derivative risk is covered with social money" "just in time".

Now, we will follow this trend in an accelerated fashion, until all derivative process is exposed as nonfunctional outside a massive hyperinflationary policy. Our wealth is and was nothing but an illusion of safety and created in our own minds. Within this mix is contained all the various gold derivatives we have come to love so well. The future failure of a gold contract does not mean that the long holder gets his price or his underlying good; it means his derivative fails to shelter his exposure by matching his other loses. In terms closer to a gold bug's heart; paper gold in any form will not match up anywhere near the price of free traded physical gold.

We are on the road to high priced gold and under priced derivatives. The same thrust will be apparent in all financial derivatives. Further, we are on the road to a fully "cash settled" contract market for gold; here in the US and abroad. In the time ahead, just before serious real price inflation rears its head, look for most all dollar based contract commodities markets to be restructured into pure "undeliverable" cash settlement markets. Markets that, also, many gold producers will be forced to use. The day of big premiums on gold coins and bullion is coming and
coming fast.

Let's head back to the parking lot and home and get ready for another day. A real hike is coming.

There they go!

(At the trail head, loading the packs)

Quick, use your binoculars, watch the action on the other side; across the paper gold valley.

Do you see them? Right over there, follow my point? Just under those low bushes; next to that big bolder; making their way out of the paper valley. Yep, that's a big paper gold trader, going over the top. Ya see em? Ha1 Ha! Sure sign the seasons are changing!

These guys, and others like them, are trying to run ahead of a trend we already knew was in process. They are going over to the other side of the paper gold mountain. If only they knew about USAGOLD a long time ago?

Yep, us PGAs beat um to the punch and those pikers

(slang for hikers on some peak in Colorado [smile])

will pay a big premium to be in our dust! Indeed, they are headed where our very own gold trail has been: in the middle of a physical gold market transition that finds its roots in
Europe.

Yup,,,,,, silver is back into the 4.20s as China sells it to buy gold; while the question of what to do about gold paper gets more official consideration every day! The dynamics of money is in flux, for sure!

Keep loading your packs, people, take lots of stores for a true wilderness experience under a starlit night; a big hike is coming.

Taking broader steps: heading towards a clearing


Onward

I'll repeat a remark made here on the trail before:
-----[One day the ECB will be] Moving their quarterly "marking to the market" of gold assets to using a local Euro Zone spot physical price; a price that will prove to out run the dollar "paper gold" market's ability to keep up. Such a play will emphasize "physical gold" positions for hedging as opposed to "paper gold" positions.-------------

Follow my steps

The coming dollar currency crisis will be, very much so, driven by an across the board failure of all derivative market function, not just in our gold derivative markets alone. As these risk dispersal markets built up over the years, that system allowed the dollar to continue in its reserve roll. The very failure of this hedge system is what will begin to transition the world away from dollar holdings. Not to mention settlement use and retention in CB reserve function.

Truly, our dollar's value would have never arrived at or retained its current level, for so long, had foreign CBs not supported it by making a background market for derivative exchange management and low rate gold loan commitments for major world investors to use. Within this tremendous mass of paper risk assets, our modern paper gold markets find their home.

When this whole quagmire of dollar support is allowed to fall away, the true nature and worth of paper gold derivatives will truly come to light. Prompting a trading recognition of their real value and their quick disposal. The ensuing price action will sever investor's faith that there is an equal connection between the owning of; what is the fundamental value and leverage of physical gold assets and simply capturing gold's currency price changes in paper asset form.

This change in market pricing dynamics will shift investor perception and force private and public wealth hedgers to see physical gold as having a far greater leverage over paper positions. An image and position the dollar gold faction and the entire gold industry have fought against for years.

This transition in hedge book policy will set off a new dynamic trend in our gold markets where physical gold soars to find a fundamental value modern gold thinkers knew existed. A value steeped in gold's rich history of being the very best barter wealth savings in the world. A value that gold could never find when tied into official money systems.


Our evolution of thought will find its roots in an inflationary financial crisis that is now beginning to unfold in dollarland. In fact, "all" dollar hedging systems will most likely meet the same fate as the effects of a real, serious price inflation in local US markets escalates. In the final overview, physical gold will be seen as the only real risk hedge; in fact; the only world class asset "that can perform such a task"!

Onward further

In simple political terms; the very leverage that all modern currency supporting derivatives represent, never could be allowed to perform; in large outright quantities! Once real inflation begins to demand that these hedges truly spread financial risk with real performance, resulting in a pile
up of loses, the political solution used time and again will return as the time honored utility that saves the day:

------change the rules------!

You see, just as there wasn't enough real gold stored in official US vaults to match pre 1971 dollars at the then existing exchange rate, there isn't enough "tradable gold" to match the inflated paper gold markets today. Both then and now, the paper derivative's function to relate and capture the value of gold was blocked from functioning.

Pre 1971; people held dollars because the physical gold that those dollars should have represented and could be traded for, hedged the risk of government sponsored price inflation. But, people found out, too late, that those gold derivatives; those pre 1971 dollars; would never be allow to function as risk hedges. We found once again that man's ability to maintain a constant link, a constant derivative value, between official money and gold,,,,,, was always an evolutionary failing trait.

The response will be exactly the same for our problems now as it was then.

-- Then --:
The dollar faction universally abrogated all gold delivery options against dollar currency and implemented cash settlement against all claims for gold. In other words; implement a pure fiat floating exchange rate and close out all gold claims by saying that investor holdings in dollars were equal to gold. In hindsight this was just another illusion; dollars were only ablr to capture the gold price if that relationship was controlled thru paper market valuations.

Then -- to -- Now:
By saying that dollar cash, using the old 35 dollar controlled rate, was the same as owning gold; the Western world embarked down the same paper road we travel today.

Modern "Western Thought" is convinced of an illusion; that capturing the price of gold is as good as capturing physical gold. Indeed, this thought was further extended to include capturing a leveraged price of gold.


--Now--:
A process is in the works to change our dollar / gold relationship again, after derivatives were inflated beyond use. Now, even the price of gold can no longer be captured on a par basis between derivative gold paper and real physical gold as the preceived value of gold is soaring. Once a super currency inflation breeds super price inflation; the derivative markets will begin to fail their hedge purpose and their trading value. These asset themselves will become the real risk.

Dollar supporters have no choice but to "NET OUT" at even any derivative hedge that may risk the system. That is, "Net Out" in a way that completely voids their risk transferring purpose as they are settled in dollar cash "no matter what effect inflation is having on the currency's value or your other dollar assets! Remember, the financial world today turns on dollar assets that are hedged; not just pure bare holdings! Block the hedge markets from performing and the dollar itself is unseated.

Make no mistake, every official rule and regulation ever written for currency crisis management involves not only currency profile assets, but also gold profile assets. With this concept in grasp; it's easy to see, with gold derivatives so widely used in current dollar support functions today, why they will be impacted as part of the paper mass.

Modern derivative usage involves gold derivatives and a new evolving crisis policy management will function somewhat the same as in 1971. It will arrive as some "net out" policy directive and universally abrogate all gold delivery options as part of the package. Any gold derivative that is used to support dollar currency exchange rates will be reworked to implement cash settlement against all claims for international currency derivatives written for gold.

Further

Is it no wonder that Euro Banks have no fear from writing short gold paper. Because the entire Euro money profile is in the background for them. Running in parallel to and not in conjunction with the current dollar system. Any Fed policy that must break the risk transferring dynamic of derivatives, to protect our US banks, will open the door to the ECB's dumping IMF protocols and using the Euro alone as their sole reserve currency. This will immediately shift all dollar derivative plays onto the market, dynamically devaluing our dollar in the process. The ECB would then be cashing out holders of their gold loans in Euros as dollar physical gold prices spike and paper gold prices plunge.

Higher still; we climb

Of course, the big difference is that Euroland will encourage a physical only market price that, in turn, also floats Euro gold values to the sky. All in an well balanced effort to replace the massive dollar asset base it lost. In this; the Euro will become the first currency block that functions as a local reserve, yet under scores its image with huge non- monetary gold assets. Is it no wonder that EuroLand citizens will be buying gold as much for its prospects to rise as for its ability to be a wealth savings. In this it will hedge the future remains of a dollar failure and its impact on the world system.

If Mr. Huge EuroLand bank owes the ECB system gold worth 100 million in current gold deals; with each 1,000 euro rise in gold he finds himself able to settle in less received physical gold. In a true "cashed out" transition of currency reserve hedges, each ounce of contracted gold owed could be
reduced many times. Every player in the gold system, that is caught with their pants down, will rush to be a part of any Euro workout. Indeed, for every major player that was long the gold loan system, for the purpose of buying gold, cash outs in Euros will offer the only return. Official players in the oil sector would eventually be receiving American gold (but that is Another story).

Pause here

Remember; we have presented, for some time, that official gold stocks were never physically "in play" to the degree the gold industry suspected. It has always been our position that it is and was "gold commitments" that were behind the market, while official physical gold was traded mostly within the CB system or delivered to the most pertinent oil players. The Swiss operation points to an end time settlement of these for the Euro side of things.

ECBMBs (European Central Bank Member Banks) never really sent out very much real gold; they just lent their good name to the BBs. That means cash pooling for the loans also. So, when a new currency transition workout proceeds, the members of the ECB are receiving Euro cash in payment for gold loans. In hindsight; it will be seen that they lent the commitment to sell gold only long enough for US inflation to end the dollar's timeline and bust its dollar system. Around ten or fifteen years over this recent concluding period?

Truly, the gold that is filling the fundamental demand deficit never was the gold coming out of CB ranks; this position was and is the gold industry just looking for an answer to explain what was truly an paper market problem impacted by official currency games!

Besides, if your business is financially structured within an ongoing paper gold market and needs said paper to trade at par with physical gold; you don't want to consider an outcome where you may be trapped selling your product at a discount! Better to fight for a rework of the same markets. A process that robs physical gold owners of fundamental value by reinforcing the paper market illusion for the benifit of a relatively small group of gold players.

That will not happen this time; believe it!

In a final thought that explains the fundamentals that tarnished gold:

The gold that filled "the supply demand gap" came from tired Western thinking gold bulls the world over. Over the last years of our dollar's timeline, they transitioned their portfolios from holding physical to holding essentially unallocated forms of leveraged paper gold. This took place in both public and big trading firms.

To the thinking of these smaller world players, who made up this mass of original physical gold ownership; future gold, options, gold stocks and long gold loans, all captured the price of gold in this modern era. Indeed, for them it was all the same and suddenly so logical and simple. But, they did and are losing their wealth to the paper monster and now,,,,, just when they thing gains are in their grasp,,,,, the rules were changed again.

let's rest here; that clearing is in sight; where some speaker if giving a talk

Packs off for now

The real world

No backpacks today. Lets just stroll over to that clearing where I'll be giving the talk. In reality, I'm just sharing with everyone the thoughts and views of a like minded gold advocate. Someone we rarely understand but somehow always knew.

-------------------------

Hello again and I welcome everyone to these ongoing talks on gold. Talks that focus on where gold and its market is taking us: -- an evolving message from an ancient metal.

It's wonderful to be with you, here in the American West, with its clear skies and cool dry air. Meeting here on the gold trail speaks to our senses in ways no city location can; imploring our minds to hearken back to what is real and alive in our world. While standing here among the mountains and trees, our financial perceptions begin a change; recasting our thoughts of accounts and credits into hazy feelings of virtual wealth we never really knew. Suddenly, bonds, stocks and paper investments descend to lower levels of importance.

It was as true yesterday as it is today, and will again be so tomorrow; that the touchable things in life are what make us whole as much as they make us wealthy. Our bodies are real, so too is the earth and all upon it: is it such an unreason that our wealth should not be real also?

For myself and many others that hear our message, the answer is no. No, it is not unreasonable to clearly own and touch what our efforts in life have brought us. I suspect that during this era, within this moment in time, events will eventually define such logic more clearly and prove it to be sound beyond any doubt.

Times change, my friends, history moves on and so too will mankind's perception of wealth. Once our perceptions will evolve, not in a forward matter, but rather in an ages old oscillation that returns us back to saving wealth itself; instead of a paper promise of wealth. With a regularity of seasons, as sure as the phases of moons, a changing of "political will" is once again about to redefine what our virtual written worth really is. In response to these changes, often made with little more than the stroke of a pen, mankind will seek a secure position. A position that will more so value an ancient wealth: a golden savings that no politicians could ever write the value of.


- As my friend would say out here: onward we move

Once again we hear the voices of shock and dismay among modern gold bulls. Followers of paper values who, ironically, display the same emotions each time their gold strategy fails them. In cycles that seem to repeat on regular schedules these investors wager on the price of gold instead of investing in the physical attributes of the real thing. In doing so they fall victim to their own misunderstandings: -- falsehoods represented by their own perceptions of what our Western gold market does and does not do.

Somewhere over the course of these last decades, Western Gold Bugs learned that it was very easy to wager on the price of gold. During this time a market evolved that made it far more convenient to bet on gold that to own it. But as this market expanded to include retail gold buyers, even simple reasoning seemed to be cast aside and all logic was lost. Truly, these were becoming markets that traded opinions and failed to produce wealth.

---- Did we Consider that: if it was easy for me to buy a gold wager, is it not just as easy for one to sell a wager?

Throughout this period, Gold Bugs seemed to reach conclusions about their paper markets that were never real. They understood how rare and valuable gold was. Yet, they fully well expected these same attributes to be reflected, not only in physical gold, but also in the price of their paper wagers. The reasoning was presented as such: -- investors that wanted to bet on the price of gold going up were unlimited in number and their demand could easily overwhelm the supply side that created these paper wagers. -- Conversely; investors that wanted to bet on the price of gold going down were limited in number and their supply of these paper wagers could never keep up with demand. You have got to be kidding?

But why would this be the case?.

They looked at this paper market and tried to think of it as a physical market. They figured that any investor that sold a wager, had to have his hands in the actual gold market, so as to supply the physical gold his wager was created against. Somehow, in our gold bull logic, we never grasped that perhaps 99%+ of the "world's" paper gold game always settled in cash. With the wager / seller simply losing his currency if he is wrong.

In a further convolution of logic, paper gold bulls never thought real world reasoning applied to them. If our paper gold bears didn't have the gold or the cash to buy the physical item, if they were demanded to do so; -- neither did our paper gold bulls ever want the physically delivered gold either! Nor did they have their hand in a cash bin deep enough to to do the deal.

---- The purpose and structure of these markets was always ignored.

The reality that confronts gold players today is that their perception of this paper market is flawed. The entirety of the world's paper gold markets are structured to capture the currency price of the metal; not actually deal in a majority of the physical aspects of it. Lost in this reality is the understanding that these markets do not impact the supply and demand for gold as much as they make a "virtual" price for gold.

Those in the business of selling paper leveraged gold to investors love to point out that long buyers can and do demand from the shorts to deliver bullion. But these same sales clerks quietly ignore the fact that short sellers can and do demand delivered cash from the bulls! When we have a market where both sides run from the other's physical demands; you are left with a paper arena that makes a "virtual" market price; not a fundamental supply and demand price.

-----Supply and demand

Also lost is the very real perception that the sum total of dollar based paper gold wagers, that can be created on both sides, is only limited by the sum of dollar liquidity floating in the world. In this logic; the number of bets on where the price of gold is going is unlimited on both sides and has no corresponding connection to the actual physical supply of gold bullion.

What "IS" firmly grasped by every major player in this market is: -- If at any time a majority in the market were to attempt to use these paper markets to extract a gross amount of physical product, the rules would not be changed! Rather, the rules would be enforced and the players would be cashed out and sent into the real physical markets to do their deals. Only then would fundamental supply and demand, based on gross dollar liquidity, create a "non virtual" real price for the product.

-- Disappointment rules the day!

Time and time again Western gold players are finding out that as dollar inflation creates more liquidity, the same of which will eventually drive price inflation, it also creates more liquidity that paper wagers can use to sell against our "virtual" gold price. While this is truly a fundamental fact of currency supply, Western paper gold bulls want to use this liquidity to leverage and effect their long side only. So as to capture a gold price moves on the upside. But they don't want others to use an equal amount of this liquidity driven leverage to supply the other side of these wagers to send gold's prices downward.

We wanted a free market and a free market is what we got: -- but it doesn't move the virtual price toward the gold bull's favor. Now they are mad because their bets are countered while physical gold advocates scoop up an almost free metal: -- using the liquidity that dollar inflation is producing. Truly, if ever there was a way to profit from gold mining, today, it's by buying this almost free physical gold the mines are producing; while mine players and paper gamblers pound their wealth into the dirt. This is what PGAs call benefiting from the leverage in mining (smile).

--- Supply and Demand: one more time

In a convoluted stretch of reason, "virtual" gold bulls wanted these markets to be regulated so the supply side of these paper creations would pay off on their bets. The bulls wanted to be able to create all the buying leverage they wanted while the bears would be locked into delivering a metal who's total world amounts are fixed. The bulls wanted free leverage without the using full amounts of real cash but wanted the bears to mark to the market with real gold buying power for every wager they made. If there is manipulation in our paper gold arena, it's in this area of investor understanding. What these markets "truly represent" is the misconception about gold in our time.

If the gold industry is unhappy with the prices their product if bringing from this paper market's leverage; they should be pushing for a change in the rules so as to force physical delivery upon everyone in these markets. That is; force delivery upon both sides! They don't, because their
financial structure is so completely immersed into the current function of these markets. Many of them and their banks could not handle a real gold price that runs out of their derivative's trading ranges.

Western paper gold bulls fueled the creation of these markets by supplying the demand for such gold vehicles and governments helped their currencies by using these same as FDIC like stickers on their reserve positions. They all wanted a place where they could bet on gold, using maximum
leverage, and not have to fully fund the physical delivery of bullion if it came to that.

Somehow in the process, everyone was thinking they were doing an end run around the slow thinking, stupid gold advocates the world over. Hoping that coin and bullion buyers, who were creating the physical demand, would one day feed the leveraged paper profits of paper players. Hoping that the rules would be changed just enough so gold could be kept in a nice tight range (300- 500).

We are seeing the results today as this fraud of a paper game as it comes to an end. It's not nice to watch. Busting, not only the dollar factions that played this sector for their best interest, but also denying any profits to the whole gold industry that chose to ignore the long term best interest of gold's market value. The same industry that decided to cater to the singular greed of a small group
by sacrificing high gold prices so leverage plays would work. In the process they played a political game to limit gold prices from getting too high and will now suffer on the altar of a "gold price without a range".

They can call the outcome anything they want: "bullion at a premium to comex" or " comex at a discount to bullion". Either way the whole system is destine to split and leave the paper players holding an incredible bag as bullion runs away with the help of fundamental gold factions in Europe.

So the message to paper players, gold mine owners and the gold industry is clear:
--we are in a world where free markets rule and political games bite the hand that feeds them
-- if you don't like your profit margins on the market you are forced to sell into, close your mines like the rest of the world's business is told to do,, if you can!
-- if paper players don't like their investment returns because the leverage is eating their lunch, move to another area,, you are free to choose -- or better yet
-- go control your controllers if you don't like the way it is in this evolving political world
-- in the mean time we PGAs are and continue to exercise our free market rights
-- we will keep doing something to advance our wealth: buying physical gold!

---------------------------

Next talk is about inflation, titled:

---- "Forget deflation! The deflation theorist are losing their wealth fast enough for all of us!" --

OK: lets head back and rest up for the next round

A quick report and comment from my office on the trail.


Once again the ECB is acting in a way that lends credibility to it being a true hard backer behind the Euro currency system. The ECB is taking an international, long term stance to managing their money and the dollar faction hates it. They hate it, because such a policy position is no longer open to them as we are forced into a super inflationary direction from which there is no turning back.

It won't be long until this downturn in the US drives the dollar into the toilet and leaves the Euro as the "last man standing". As the gap between inflation rates and returns on Euros grows, that currency will be seen more and more like a world class money. World class; in that the Central Bank is more driven to keep the money strong and not base its policy on local politics the way the US does.

---- Remember: Unlike the Fed, which has a mandate to boost jobs, the ECB's main task is to combat inflation.------

----- Over the last decade or so, my nation (the USA) has always played it's economy and financial arena as a free market driven system. Well, it always looked that way as long as the dollar's reserve function helped deliver those free trade benefits. But, low and behold, let us turn down a little, come under a little preassure and our socialist printing pressed go into overdrive.

The call goes out to bail out the Airlines, banks, brokers, insurers, post office and anyone else that's in trouble. Protect our Steel industry and to heck with the world: this free market idea can take a hike, boys. --------

The media concentrates on treating the dollar more like a stock investment than a major international reserve. Considering the way our Fed is socializing our money policy now; perhaps the dollar has embarked down that road and is becoming " just a quick trade investment"! Perhaps a Hyper Trade investment, at that.

I think the majority of Western money theorist want this perception in place:

--"lower rates build the economy and therefore the currency, too!"--

Never mind that this flys in the face of everything we and the IMF taught the third world about money policy over decades! A policy that says: your country is going down the drain because your money policy is not free trade structured like ours is! Now, we suddenly cheer any policy that trends to support us and try to explain it in a "dollar supporting" slant.

We do this, because we want the dollar market to deliver our investments out of the current US fire storm; it has nothing to do with the strength or hardness of the dollar. In this respect, media cheer leading has little to do with the dollar being a sanctuary for foreign holders during troubled times, either. It has everything to do with local internal US investments going bad. To hell with the hard currency policy we taught you: -- a return on money that's above inflation or free market competition to weed out the week: -- We want my money back and hang the world!

This is a repeat of the same message sent in 1971 when we dropped gold.

I think the ECB and the BIS have known, for some time, that this would be the typical US reaction whenever some trouble really came along. They just waited untill the world twistes the wrong way and sure enough, the US dove for the bait! This is why Europe and the BIS structured the Euro system so it could completely discard all dollar reserve function if needed.

Truly, if the dollar IMF system can be the reserve for all internal US banking assets; then the Euro could easily do the same in Europe. Especially as US inflationary money printing eventually drives our price inflation rate to a level that makes dollars and dollar debts, outside the US, valueless assets! Paying back those debts will be like tossing a nickel where one once launched a bill to settle a debt.

Today, many dollar investors have a terrible flaw in their view of Euros; not unlike Western thinking gold investors. They curse the Euro as it strives to reverse the very trend that dollar lovers say is taking down their own currency. Standing next to them, gold players curse the dollar and buy illusions of gold assets; but at the slightest move up can's wait to sell their gold paper for more dollars. Then they tell everyone that they are making wealth by building up their holdings of a failing currency. I tell you this simple minded human game has bankrupted more than one nation of
peoples.

I buy Euros because that's the currency I intend to keep through out this transition era. Of course I own dollars and will likely keep using them right thru any super inflation. I never expect the dollar to disappear. Most hard money investors, with extra funds to hold, also have that same view. They are simply wanting some of their wealth in the next international currency trend. A trend who's management policy is based on creating a real return; not socializing the currency holder wealth thru US and Japan like give-a-way interest rates.

Apart from our Western trading crowd, who consistently lose their money, Euro owners and Physical Gold Advocates own these items with no intentions of selling these to make more dollars. They hold them because the world financial system is changing faster than trading can compensate; and this trend will accelerate to run right over traders as their markets shut down around them. Believe it.

So, I say, good for the ECB and more so, good for gold. I'm playing the leverage that modern dollar derivatives are delivering to my door step; buying cheaper gold and cheaper Euros. The leverage in gold mines is delivered to us; in that derivatives markets force them and stale physical longs to supply the world with gold at almost free prices. At least until the dollar crashes this illusion gold market price. The leverage in dollars is delivered to us; in that the US must super inflate their currency to support its derivative hedges, in the process creating Euro exchange rates at low levels.

The game goes on and Physical Gold Advocates keep right winning while leverage hard money types pour their wealth on the ground. In this day, at this time, investments in most dollar assets and any other "gold want to be" metals is to be doing little more than to play the leverage side of a
failing derivative.

Physical gold is the only wealth to hold and the only wealth that can and will stand beside to the next reserve currency system; the Euro. The history we are writing will further prove this to be so. Events are moving our way. I say; find yourself a coin and bullion dealer that has a grasp of these
events and stay with them thru it all. The world is moving towards high priced gold on a free physical only market and physical shops will find themselves at the center of this evolution.

More Thoughts and Comments from the Trail House
http://money.iwon.com/jsp/nw/nwdt_ge.jsp?section=news&news_id=reu-l2510670&feed=reu&date=20011025&cat=USMARKET

Somewhere in the 1970s era I was exposed to the thinking of several different deflationist. It seemed that all of their conclusions came to the same end: that dollar deflation would rule the day, no matter what. Mind you now,,,,,, most of them were split on the finer points of the issue, but for all of them; inflation would have its day even if prices would rise somewhat. Deflation was always the final outcome.

One of the central themes, in these thoughts, was concerning how this coming deflation would impact plain old residential real estate. You see, most of these guys advocates selling excess residential property because it was, sooner or later, going down for the count. Mostly because the mortgage markets would be destroyed in the deflation and nobody could buy.

-- Note: The reader has to understand that these discussions were directed towards people and investors that had plenty of net worth. And I do mean Plenty! The argument wasn't about how to survive; rather how to balance a truly conservative estate portfolio. --

As time has passed we can see several major flaws in their thinking. Flaws that cost them a bunch of credibility, if not personal money. One point, that I have touched on here several times, was in understanding just how much ourselves and our economic structure would and did evolve into accepting fiat money use. Even though it was, "god forbid", separated from gold.

In one area alone, the bond markets, investors reacted far different than deflationist thought they would. Twenty ++ years ago, it was expected that just gross increases in money printing alone would be enough to crash the bond markets. Not talking about price inflation here, but money inflation and that should have started a deflationary fall in our credit markets. It almost happened, several times, but never followed thru. It seemed that the market function had evolved to accept fiat inflation as a prerequisite to modern economic function. In a like comparison to today's thinking; investors assumed that as long as we had an expanding economic stance, sourced by inflating fiat supply, price inflation would not impact long bond credibility. We saw confirmation of this over many years. We saw that our credit markets, especially long bonds, were used in spite of
the price inflation threat. Indeed, there was a ready market demand for bond purchases.

In hind sight, long term holders of bonds did do very well if their position was part of a balanced holding and they didn't need to sell at bad times. Even now, dollar bonds have gained as rates are pushed lower.

Back to the thought:

This whole IMF dollar system has always been based on an expanding fiat theory that swells GDP over time. Investors that bet on deflation coming along, after each of our bouts of inflation, were badly burned as deflation was overcome. Economic function returned, essentially because price inflation could not rout the overall market for long credit.

The flaw in all of this was in the reserve structure of our Dollar IMF money system. The fact that the world had to walk, lock step, with our money policy meant that their goods production would almost always be cheaper than ours; keeping local US price inflation under control. In other words; local US based price inflation could not get out of hand as long as the rest of the world was willing to use their economic production to control it by selling into our expanding fiat system.

In this, the dollar could be inflated without end while our credit markets functioned in a non inflationary environment.

But there is an end.

A money system like this has a definite timeline and that point is reached when the world can move away from keeping price inflation low in the US. That point is reached when Another money system comes along to challenge the dollar and, in the process, offer these other goods producing countries a chance to buy some "lifestyle" for themselves.

At first, the show is dull as investors keep right on buying into the dollar argument above: that an expanding fiat base builds non inflationary growth. This is one reason traders still buy US long credit, not to mention chasing rising dollar exchange rates; they expect more of the last several decades of economic theory to keep right on going. It won't.

The dollar faction saw its match early in the 90s as the Euro was taking shape. To counter this threat, as I have outlined here in several ways, they promoted derivative hedges as a way of insuring dollar dominance. These hedges, including gold derivatives, only served to leverage the entire dollar / IMF system beyond its ability to serve as a real fiat money system, today.

I mean; that our whole dollar landscape has now become just a trading asset arena: its now evolving away from any meaningful currency use to trade for real goods. It can head in no other direction because our local economic structure, the USA economic base, cannot possible service even a tiny fraction of the buying power currently held in dollars worldwide.

So what does this have to do with Real estate?

Take a look at any broad section of the US; Northeast, SouthWest, etc.. If any of the deflationist were correct, their reasoning back in the late 70s and early 80s should have produced at least an average fall in Residential real estate. Can any of you find an "average" of property today, that is lower than early 80s prices?

Of course I'm not talking about the spikes in Hawaii, New York , Denver or San Francisco; those are just blips on an ever rising inflation scale. Even if they fall some from here, it isn't part of a deflationary act playing out. Average home prices will rise all across this country no matter what the future economic holds. A super inflationary stance by the Fed means that even unemployed workers can buy a house and pay for it! Watch how this all comes about. The dow will not be much different when seen ten years from now; a drop to 5,000 then off again, is a real possibility!

The same is true for anything perceived as something real: "even silver" (grin).

The difference is in the drastic ups and downs derivatives will place on all asset markets. Silver may hit my .50 before taking off and so will many other real assets. My point is that we are on an "end time run" in fiat dollar production that will soon produce a spike in real price inflation that crushes hedge vehicles. One item alone, physical gold, because it is the main wealth asset behing the next currency system, will outrun everything by a wide margin. No matter the derivative's hold on it!

As the Euro builds a base, it will drive an inflationary recognition into our credit markets, then freezing up our derivative markets. That perception will fuel a complete failure of our bond markets and force the fed to buy up any and all credit; paying in full. If needed, Bush and congress will see to it that enough money is printed so we are paid in cash for everything! Don't laugh, this is where we are headed. In the mean time, whether or not our economy is growing, stalling or failing, will have little or no impact on price inflation.

You see, living with real serious price inflation goes something like this:

---- "Honey, I talked to Fred again, he can't sell his house! Poor guy, he has had it up for two years now and has to raise his asking price again. No takers, yet. The last couple was just about to close but took a month too long; they almost got the cash together, too. He backed out to raise the asking price, again. Oh well, that's not so bad, we had to jump ours up three times before selling."
----------
Inflation runs crazy when a money system is forced to "print out". We will "print out" our dollar, too. Getting there just takes time and an alternative system to cause it.

In the mean time look for the premiums on cash bullion and cash coins to begin rising well above contract and futures prices. I have been watching for this confirmation for some time. This one signal is all we need to confirm that a breakdown and total failure of dollar based bullion markets is near. I expect we will hear and excuse like this:

-- The settlement price on future contracts is really a wholesale price. Besides, because we are moving into full cash settlement of gold, without physical delivery, you can take this wholesale price and add whatever premium is necessary to buy your physical gold. No matter that our wholesale settlement cannot match a payment for bullion cost plus premium; just use more leverage to buy more contracts than you need for outright physical. See,,,,, it all plays out! (BIG BROKER SMILE with little horns sticking out of his head) ----------

People, take a hard look at Randy's post on the main forum. His ----# 64186 Monetary choices -- ECB holds rates solid, dumps dollars------- goes a long way to showing the mindset of the Euro system. (thanks for sharing, Randy) This stance is very appealing to a whole host of nations outside our dollar faction world. We have but to look no further than Britain to see that this is true.

------Blair says 2002 EU summit key for euro, economy -----
Thursday October 25, 2:41 PM EDT --

LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Thursday the success of the euro and the wider European economy hinged on the EU's ability to push through
long-discussed economic reforms next year.

Blair, launching a Belgo-British conference in London, earmarked the European Union's Barcelona summit next year as a key staging post and said the success of the launch of euro notes and coins was crucial not just for the 12 euro zone members but for Britain too.

"We have an interest in this," he said, stating his policy that in principle his government wanted to join a successful single currency.

"Barcelona will be critical in how the world views the development of the European economy," Blair said.

If the summit is a success, it will help make the euro a success, he said.-----------------

------------

Another thing we can count on and I mentioned this before:

The moment England is seen as even a "virtual" member of the Euro club; the world will jump on every physical ounce of gold available at whatever dollar amounts anyone will part with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and sell every paper gold play into the dirt in the process!!

I say, know your dealer, buy your bullion early and watch for this act to begin. It's closer than you think!

Monetary choices -- ECB holds rates solid, dumps dollars
http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/011025/l25344987_2.html
FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday, ignoring calls from politicians urging it to do more to prop up the euro zone economy....The [independent] ECB angered some euro zone governments, worried about rising job losses and stalling growth, when it kept rates unchanged at its meeting two weeks ago, arguing that still high inflation left it little room for maneouvre.
-----

Central banks have learned this lesson in the past three decades (but politicians have not): the provision of easy monetary policy does not create jobs nor does it stimulate real economic growth. Therefore, a "good" (competent) central bank will not meddle with monetary policy under the premise of affecting the unaffectable. The best contribution a good central bank can ever be expected to make to the well-being of a national economy is through the successful delivery of price stability -- thus providing a stable basis upon which business planning and contracts for the future are made.

The Federal Reserve surely knows this fully as well as the ECB. The problem is that the Fed does not have the independence to resist the off-base political/legislative mandate to foster full employment via monetary policy. But even if we were to put that consideration aside, the Fed would likely be aggressively easing anyway, simply to save the banking system from collapse during this downturn in our manic economic cycle.

Sure, the Fed tries to maintain the stance that no bank is too big to be allowed to fail, but we always find that theory and reality serve different masters. So, as the officials at the Fed ease rates, they put the best political spin on it by saying it is to satisfy the politicians and to stimulate the American economy. In reality, they are trying to keep the banking machine from seizing up with ample applications of easy grease.

Meanwhile on another front, the latest consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem reveals that gold reserves during the past week were held at a steady level, whereas the net position in foreign currency was allowed to drop by EUR 600 million in value. The prevailing trend continues to be a net dishoarding of dollars.

Within the Eurosystem, foreign currency assets now stand at EUR 258.1 billion in value, while gold assets stand at EUR 128.235 billion (valued this quarter at 318.53 euros/ounce).

Still at the Trail House
Ok!

Check out those new home numbers? How can this be; people are financing and buying homes in the middle of massive layoffs and cutbacks. It just goes to prove that if you expand a fiat enough, the physical market for anything real will be brought. The secret is in "expanding enough" and using the right kind of fiat to expand with.

----- New Homes Sales for September were just released and came down 1.4% at an 864K pace. This was slightly stronger than the consensus estimate for 860K though softer than August's reading of 898K. ----------------

Well, our fed isn't shy at all. They don't hide behind some hard dollar theory when it comes to giving out free money; especially when the currently they are giving away is the world's reserve. No sir, our American home buyer has the right to buy himself a roof no matter what his economic fate.

This is the game plan that works,,,,,, has worked,,,, for decades. As long as your local economic structure is based on a "fractional credit reserve banking" that is not affected by price inflation: then the people using your internal dollar market will buy goods using whetever "almost free credit" that's avaliable.

Americans exploit the system because they use credit created buying power to buy real "non inflationary priced goods". No matter the debt load as long as the fed will cover their cost by refinancing said debt at ever lower rates. And the Fed can do this as long as the world has to support the "only currency game in town" by delivering their real goods for our dollars.

Again; this all works as long as the world "buys into" using our dollars. As I said; an expanding fiat works to grow the economy thru expanding credit buying power because the fed can support the system with credit creation that has no "inflation premium". That lack of premium only exists as long as Americans can exchange free credit for real physical goods. Once this perception changes its over. Once the world understands that it's not local US goods that stands behind dollar growth, but less expensive foreign goods,,,,,,,,,, the stage is set for our "supporters" to sell to themselves!
Making themselves "lifestyle rich". All they need is Another currency unit.

Today, the ECB said that their M3 was rising at a 7.6 rate and doing so because people were moving more wealth into savings. Can anyone figure that one out? Hello,,,,, they keep their short rates well above inflation (or at least above the US dollar rates) and international people are saving the currency. In the face of this our fed is expected to lower rates again to around 2%?

Somewhere in the middle of all this; real savers will supply Euroland with a solid base of credit wealth that can be borrowed without driving their local price inflation thru the roof. Then: other national economies will have a market that shares realistic price levels for all goods. Then; all economic systems will begin a non inflationary expansion that centers around Euro use! All of this period will mirror our (US) internal coming inflationary expansion that limits our ability to import or export. Think about it.

-------

There is a lot going on now,,,, so: Later today I'm going to address some posted items made on the Main forum in an effort to expand on the political game in process. Will be back later.

A few comments on comments!


----- The Euro is a mere convenience for trade among the group of user nations if it cannot buy a bbl of oil in international markets. That's a fact.----

I hear that some French buys are already being invoiced and settled in Euros. But, then again, they don't like to admit that they even use the awful stuff. (grin) Actually, with so much of their electric needs provided by Nuclear,,,,,, what doooo they need oil for?

------ Could it be that some dollar holders are buying up US stocks at what will later seem to be bargain prices? What better place is there to dump dollars without upsetting prices?-------

Well,,,,,,,, some small players may be doing this. But, big holders of overseas dollars have to ask: "what would foreign exchange controls do to my big stock gains"? Besides, if they can only get 5 or 10% of their dollar wealth into physical holdings,,,,, the rest of the cash could evaporate later and they would still be light years ahead. Considering the coming gold / dollar free market revaluation. Only, the problem has been for a number of years; how do all of these old Euro Dollar accounts get into even 1% physical when the whole market has such a waiting list. But, ask about paper gold? Sure,,,, all you want. Has anyone ever figured how much gold 1% of the whole Euro Dollar float would buy? Even at $1,000 US per ounce?

----------Europe has not matched US efforts to stimulate growth since the September 11 attacks, Breuer said, because "we have no common, defined, decided economic and financial policy in Europe".-------

(comment by USAGOLD site steward) More importantly, it does have a single independent authority steering monetary policy down the middle of the road so as to be neutrally suitable for a wide coalition of interests. ------

You have that right Randy! Rolf Breuer sounds like all the late model financial planers in Europe that still don't know where EuroLand is headed. These guys got their economic stars while studying at the socialist feet of our political Federal Reserve. Only trouble is that they never understood that fiat inflation using a world reserve currency, like our dollar, is different from other systems. We buy cheap social policy and economic expansion with the blood and sweat of foreign productivity. I bet Old Breuer thinks its ok for a business to buy $1.00 running shoes from asia and sell them in Dollar land for $120.00. Then he would point out that shoe inflation is only running at a few percent
because those shoes went up $3.00 last year. Oh well.

The Euroland Germans, and the ECB studied our ways for a long time and now fully understand how to attract other nations into a fair game. The Euro will become a "world standard" more so than a reserve because they want it to be a fair currency that's accepted for it's value. For the Euro to gain American financial acceptability later, it will do so because it will be the "last man standing" when this inflation storm resides.

------ Government gets "tennis elbow" from throwing the ball of string --------

I know where that one came from (smile). All of us concentrated much too long on when the Fed would eventually fail to push our monetary string. Did we ask this question as if the US was about to become "suddenly dollar responsible"? Or was it because the markets would over rule the fed's hand? I bet we asked because "fiat credit theory" said the fed would eventually meet such a fate.

Double baloney! Our fiat world would and did evolve around this problem. Once the dollar inflated itself to the end of its "gang plank", it was into the inflationary drink sailor! The Euro will take over and we will become like any other national currency; subject to pay as you go politics and social policy. Can't push that string? Pick it up and heave it in a third world like inflationary pitch. That ball will fly, brother,,,,,, oh will it fly!

--------Putting these two together, I observe the following -- So, really, the Euro Banks don't mind selling gold short, because when the big blowup comes, they suddenly have a use for the the dollar reserves they have piled up. Is this a fair conclusion? ---------

Well sir,,,,,,,, we should all think about this for a bit? It's awful clear, to anyone that has just a little of the facts, that the paper gold markets cannot ever be converted into physical gold. The numbers would be????,,,,,, That's just a rhetorical, don't even try to put a real number on it.

You see, all the armchair gold bugs hold onto their paper leverage and cheer for some big paper short covering blow up. A paper squeeze that forces the "virtual" price of gold way up. But, who exactly is it that is going to be a threat to the paper Bullion bank market? You,,,,, me,,,,,, that man
behind the tree?

What if me and a thousand others came up with a 1 trillion in cash and used it to lock down paper contracts to deliver us 1 billion ounces of gold. The paper gold market has the means to match our commitments dollar for dollar. I mean, they could put the money up, not gold ina a vault, and get
on the other side of us,,,,, margin to margin.

OK, now we stand face to face. Even if we had enough free cash to pay for delivery,,,,,, what jurisdiction would let us settle; England, US, South Africa, Canada,,,, who? No, we would be told to cash out and buy our gold on the tiny physical markets. In a Hunt like joke,,,,,close out would come and we would eat it, big time. Even if we broke even, how exactly would we exchange our cash for metal in the tiny bullion markets without driving the price to the moon?

The reason I play this out, in text, is for others to understand that there ain't gona be a run up in paper gold. That market is a derivative style currency support and it was never set up to be a big time deliver machine. Its control will end when the currency system, it's built on, fails and takes the "virtual" gold market price with it,,,, to the floor! But, long before that plays out, the real bullion markets will get extremely thin and build up a huge premium to contract settlement. It will do this because some financial disorder will invalidate, and most likely, force an official deferral in physical delivery; indefinitely. From there the show will proceed.

The big dollar gold shorts in Euroland have real market exposure but no political exposure. Their political house would just as soon settle this at whatever level the paper prices sink to; this is their real market exposure and it will most likely be profitable. There will be no political exposure, forcing them to settle in physical delivery; because the US system will opt out first because of inflationary preasures! Very simple political logic, right? Try asking someone that is hip deep in gold stocks or futures if they grasp it? Hard thing, that political perception is,,,,, especially when your pocket book controls your brains. (smile)

Again; this all mostly covers the bulk of the markets. Paper gold owners that have oil to trade will get their ticket clicked,,,,,, believe it. However, I bet that by then most of them will be asking to settle their gold in Euros.

----- So, Japan has excess fiat they don't know what to do with.------

Japan is a different problem. They have been locked into the US dollar economy for so long that they cannot escape. There is simply no way that China will let them into the Euro house. The HK / China central bank system, also known as Big Trader, simply wields too much economic sway between Asia and Europe. In historical precedent, the orient express always headed to Europe and never saw "The Japans".

Actually, Japan doesn't want to go there and has risked a decade of time waiting for some economic change in the US. I have said from way back, that Japan will go down with our (US) inflationary tide. They will waste away their dollar assets following our lead. Those that think that these peoples want to be part of a third world currency block do not know them. I do,,,, but that is another story.

--------- A Trail house? A Trail office?! Life on the Trail is growing much more comfortable than before, when we all "pitched camp" and ate pork 'n' beans around the fire! ----------

Believe it or not,,,,, I was in a real tent on my last vacation. Tell this forum the truth,,,, my-Lady,,, when was the last time you went for a wilderness experience,,,,,, slept in a tent and watched the stars while around a fire? On the GoldTrail such an expierence is valuable beyond all things, no?

Pork-n-beans??????? I should not have saw that,,,,,, I'm off to eat! (smile)

Gold,,,,,, Gold,,,,, Who has the Gold?


Let's take a walk and think about the big picture for a minute. Then we can get back to that question.

-----------

If you followed most of Another's Thoughts over the years the line of reasoning below will fall easily into place.

Somewhere during the late 90s, when events made it more certain that the Euro would be formed, the threat to use real gold as a partial pricing unit for oil was moved to the back burner.

By including an extremely small amount of delivered gold in trade for oil, along with digital dollar settlement, gold would once again be returning to it's ancient roots as a world class wealth used in barter. Instead of allowing it to be controlled by bankers and governments, gold's socialist tie in with official money use would be all the further distanced.

So, if swapping oil with third world nations, for grains, finished goods and other commodities, offered lesser countries another way to circumvent their lack of hard currencies while using the dollar system; then using gold to partially settle world wide oil trades would bring more balance into this one-sided dollar economic world. Trade alignments, such as gold for grain, grain for copper, copper for oil, then oil for gold would easily be adapted into our current solo dollar realm; forcing the dollar to share it's fiat use demand with real barter trade for real goods. In this, allowing international trade to abrogate the dollar's iron clad pricing of goods and services to the singular benefit of American lifestyles.

Where official dollar supporters have structured our paper gold market in a way that values gold only upon it's money backing merits; a returning of gold into it's barter trade realm would force a realignment of values between physical and paper. Once again allowing gold's value to soar and creating a large enough liquidity mass to serve not only as an oil trading medium, but wealth savings for all.

---------------------------

On the back burner, perhaps, but not out of the picture.

In this premier position of barter trade for oil, gold itself would have been backed with a demand component, the demand for oil, that would last as long as the world remained advanced. As dollars and Pounds were once backed with delivery of gold, in a turn of events, modern physical gold would be backed with delivery of oil.

Even matching a barrel of oil to just 1/100 of a gram, the long term demand for oil would have brought physical gold trading back into the forefront and shown the true worth of gold in it's non money barter roll. Such a price valuation that has not been seen in, perhaps, a thousands years.

With physical pricing again setting the level for derivatives pricing, the dollar reserve system's evolution from gold standard to derivative standard would permanently dissolve. Not only would our current form of paper gold would lose it's effective control in price discovery; in a repeat of 1971, our paper gold game failure would once again costing paper leveraged investors many fortunes.

-----------

For now the Euro: the vision held together

Once again the choice would be clear for both common man and international trader; use fiat if it's economy of use is efficient and controlled or use taxable barter to help control your controllers. Within the confines of the US, this may not become a reality (I think it will), but internationally, with European support, it cannot be avoided. All nations will use gold as nature intended and do so for the betterment of mankind.

At this point in time, there is no longer a concern that the Dollar's timeline might have no end in sight. With the world's more favorite form of trade settlement, digital currency, about to be represented by the moneys of a group of nations; the dollar's singular drive to enhance the lives of only one people is about to end with the currency's credibility.

First and foremost in the ECBs political will to establish a credible fiat, gold was and is set free to be valued at whatever level free physical trading would allow. We know now that the dollar marketplace for gold paper is coming to an end with this process. Not only will they be allowing limited, taxable gold barter to accelerate, but to also encourage it's bilateral barter use within international trade settlement. Something the IMF has fought so hard to contain.

Therefore, by the end of the 90s, the need to employ gold for partial payment in oil settlement, as a means to block our dollar faction, was removed from the table. With that the threat that buyers, traders and hard money players would join oil sellers in flocking into the physical gold markets, also disappeared. The thought that driving this suddenly new oil pricing tool thru the roof, was simply restructured. For the time being, the complete burning of our paper gold markets was put on hold; along with the 280 floor big trader and other official gold holders said "must stand" at that
time.

Indeed, from hindsight, the often repeated remark that "all paper would burn" was not invalidated; rather expanded in scope beyond just our dollar paper gold markets. It now seemed that this paper burning would also include the entirety of dollar assets, both debt and equity. With the
acceptance of a Euro based trade protocol, our dollar system would now be forced into a super inflationary fire. Truly, this day has arrived with current events literally shouting "monetary inflation" as we have never seen it before!

Not only Euros, but some form of freely priced barter gold is now firmly on the road to becoming a real competition for use in world wide trade. Within this evolution, the currency trade settlement game is being slowly switched from virtual to real time as the act of slowly accumulating gold over
a long transition period is drawing to a close. Over several past years and for the remaining time ahead, selling the illusion of paper gold short while buying free gold will come more into open view and no longer be the sport of kings. The coming premium price, paid for physical delivery, will develop for all to see. Something I will personally welcome as an open confirmation of our views.

The events begin to unfold:

To the bane of Western thinking hard money gold bugs, who craved the leverage illusion our gold markets seemed to create, the death watch for their favorite game is about to begin. As if out of a fog, an end to our gold pricing illusion will march, hand in hand, with an end of our economic prosperity. The coming inflationary fire will now sever the wealth our reserve dollar system created for all of us Americans. In the same scope of time a, Euro based, free gold price will evolve out of these inflation fires. I for one do not relish this outcome, but welcome the good such a staunch reality will infuse into our national values.

We pointed out earlier this year that our Fed would begin it's inflationary march "now" and never turn back again. They did "then" and we are well into it now! Our point was made in spite of all the past decades of similar "dollar inflation" calls other hard money people declared were coming. Our dollar's decline never arrived for these people because they based their calls on economic theory; instead of "political will". "Political will" won then and will so now as we point correctly in the next direction.

Many said that the "bond vigilantes" would hamstring any effort to price inflate a credit driven money like the dollar reserve. Perhaps causing our Fed to eventually lose the war as it "pushes on a string"? Many of you have read countless opinions as to why our credit markets would implode into deflation as a "mise" style economic theory surfaced to control the controllers. Truly, these people confuse theory with human action as much as they do not understand real physics! Indeed, strings that cannot be pushed are either thrown or cast aside in the real world.

Reference today; we see where the "political will", trumps economic theory hands down, as the dollar people remove 30 year bonds from the system. In the process, forcing rates all the lower. The next time someone reads to you reams of hard money theory; ask they why they said the same thing 30 years ago about the dollar and the US economy? But it kept right on running; proving them repeatedly wrong? Now, for the hundredth time they say: "mise is correct, the markets cannot be faked, so a little deflation will follow this inflation!"

Baloney! The evolution of Political will is now driving the dollar into an end time hyper inflation from where we will not return. That is our call. Bet your wealth on the other theorist's call if you want more of Their last 30 years of hard money success.

More is to come!

Are you worried about South America? Don't! We will print all the money it takes to save any and all US financial interest in that sector.

Are you worried that we will enter an Japan like economic environment with rates at zero, economic stagnation and falling real asset values? Don't! They do not use an out going world reserve currency and we do! We will print what ever amounts needed to keep real Estate up, the Dow up and our economy purring: no matter what the value of the dollar on foreign exchange becomes. Or our eventual price inflation.

Our local economy will soar in dollar terms; no matter what our dollar is worth.

Are you worried that our 10 year bond, the new bench mark, will soar and squeeze off any recovery? Don't! We will just remove it from use and move to the 5 year,,,,,,,, to be replaced later by the 2 year,,,,,,,, to be replaced later by the 6 month,,,,,, 1 month,,,,,, 1 week,,,,, 1 day,,,,,, then
CASH!

-----------------

Who has the gold?

I do and so should anyone that wishes to participate in the next currency system. Only, don't expect your gold to become money, it won't! It will become the most valuable wealth asset in your portfolio,,,,, by a long shot. For the simple thinker; gold is good. That's all we need to know. For the man with a question: Gold must vise in value many many times just to regain it's wealth barter asset value. Perhaps $10,000 to start. Then, it will run with any and all dollar inflation,,,,, even Euro inflation that ECB people openly admit must be a part of a dollar to Euro transition.

The EuroLand Central Banks have every bit of gold in their vaults their accounts say they do. For that matter, so does the USA (for now!). So what if they or we swapped it out on paper? It means nothing because the gold never moved. Remember, EuroLand is playing a dollar gold market game
for now. If we walk, and they know we must will walk first, they will simply opt out of the dollar bullion paper system. Period! Why do you think England it trying so hard to enter the Euro fold? Think: saving their bullion liabilities by opting onto the other side!

Hell, pre 1971 the US swapped it's entire vault of gold to foreign interest by issuing dollars overseas. In a news flash, some seemed to have missed, we killed that arrangement by simply keeping the gold! Today, because the ECB would love to see the entire dollar gold market fail, I cannot imagine them shipping gold to support it if we default on shipments. Well, perhaps gold bugs would think this appropriate because it saves their leveraged futures, options and mine investments?

No,,,, most of these theories about missing gold are extrapolations that attempt to explain how the industrial / physical gold market is meeting demand. Hard money thinkers simply cannot believe that private Western gold holders have been unloading real gold for the paper variety and filling the physical demand void in the process.

If this paper buying is true, it goes a long way in explaining how fractional gold paper has filled the real demand for gold. It also ruins the dreams of investors in "illusion gold" because it points to a colossal default and asset seizure (via windfall taxes) is coming to a mine near you. Events march on and will soon begin to prove "who knows what" about our political world. Watch carefully, the
show is beginning.

In a final note: I see that in spite of world shaking events, the downfall of our paper gold markets is keeping the "virtual" price of paper gold very low. Just remember; inflation in the paper gold markets works the very same as inflation in currency markets: it cheapens the value of the paper holding and works against allowing leverage to return real gains. Conversely, physical gold will gain as leveraged gold assets fail.

Once again, I see where Big Trader is selling silver to buy real gold. Some people just know where "political Will" is going. (smile) Others don't.

Thanks

An "inflationary depression" is in the cards -- a "price deflation" doesn't have a chance!

----------------------

Back in the mid to late 70s Sir John Templeton always drove his point home for investors watching Luis Rukiser's show. (how does one spell his name,,,,, we always called him Lou Baby (smile))

Sir John, living here on Layford Cay, kept saying that the Dow of the 70s was very under priced and would soar. He was the most absolutely correct person stating that then! But more into the mechanics of his perception: he knew that anyone buying the Dow and waiting a decade or more, would gain way beyond mere price inflation. Monetary inflation would eventually drive the perceived virtual wealth of US stocks ever higher. So high, in fact, that their percentage gains over price inflationary gains would be incredible. They were!

Truly, what John was referring to was the effects that simple "passive inflation" has on paper assets; especially in a "reserve currency's" domestic market. In this; real price inflation is mostly exported by importing "real goods" competition. This happens as we export excess credit dollars to buy things. It also has another effect; some of that same exported printed money flows in a circle and joins native investor's buying of local paper assets. When this process first starts, "passive inflation", in the form of massive money creation that's far beyond real price inflation, allows one to gain "virtual paper wealth" even before the markets price out the gains. That is; the Dow stays cheap at first then eventually rises to absorb the money inflation! As long as prices don't rise too much.

People that followed his advise, accumulated the Dow over a decade or more; buying "virtual wealth" before the fact! Stock investors made a killing by positioning their assets where this created "passive monetary inflation" would eventually end up. Even though hard money players laughed at them all thru out the 70s, 80s and early 90s! Look who is laughing now? Stocks tromped hard money plays hands down for over 20+ years! Even considering the latest fall on wall street.

My friends:

Today, this same "virtual wealth" effect has been created again and is located in physical gold bullion. I believe Sir John has already made part of my point but I will repeat.

When a currency system comes to the end of it's reserve use, I'm speaking politically, it's domestic market will come to a point where it can no longer export "real price inflation" in the format of; "shipping it's excess currency outside it's borders". This happens because internal money inflation, that is super currency printing, is increased so much that it overwhelms even it's export flow. Worse, even that export flow later tumbles as the fiat falls on exchange markets.

The effect is that local "passive inflation" , built up over decades and fully reflected in "Sir John's" paper assets, spreads out as "aggressive inflation" and hyper price rises begin. In this action, the very same wealth effect that was eventually priced into "John's" Dow stocks and other assets, begins a long march of being priced into real gold.

Anyone that has accumulated physical gold over this past long period was doing the exact same thing Dow buyers of the late 60s and early 70s were doing: ------ saving "wealth" as unpriced "virtual wealth" stored up over that "passive inflation" period. ---

----------------------
As "political will" begins to impact the economies of the US,

our old "virtual wealth" that is no longer in the form of "passive inflation" nor limited to the currency, and is openly displayed in our vast sea of paper assets values including stocks, bonds--------

must now be defended in the open with official printed money flow.
---------------

The "virtual wealth" in gold, saved over years by patient investors, will also be priced to market in this process.

Never mind that during the Dow years paper gold markets could not work in parallel with all the other asset gains; it couldn't. Hard money players, trying to somehow play the Dow's game, never caught on to what was happening. Instead of buying "virtual wealth" by saving real gold; they brought
leveraged bets that gold would be priced correctly during the "paper asset" years.

Obviously, this "trade" failed hard money players as the waves of value from other paper gains and derivatives leverage were employed to match against their every long bet on gold. Not only that; the "virtual wealth" in gold was never opened for them with the super price inflation they all thought was coming during that era!

Now that the paper game is about to stop for the dow, it will also cut off the leverage of gold bets. Just as the real game begins.

The reason for this is that our massive, decades long gains in our stock markets did not bankrupt the leverage in the money system. Where as any massive rise in physical gold values cannot be priced into "derivative gold" without crashing the system.

Remember; in political inflation's, money is printed
to save the assets as they are currently priced; not create new loses by saving the liquifying the leverage that's countering your play!

This paper gold market will be cashed out at prices far below real bullion trading so as to inflate further the books of the Bullion Banks,,,,,, not destroy them. At least this is how the US side will proceed.

------
Michael Kosares-- A thru Z


In this perception USAGOLD has been guiding it's clients, and now the world, in much the same way Sir John did decades ago.

"Buy what has value at the greatest discount and wait for the politics of money to price your new savings correctly"!

The politics of wealth today is centered around gold bullion and only gold bullion: that is where the wealth and power will be manifest: this is where the gains will be! To bet on the rest of the hard market ; is to bet against the coming inflation making your asset whole!

Place as much of your wealth in physical gold as your understanding allows and save this "virtual wealth" of the ages today: waiting for it to become real wealth, priced correctly in the market place, tomorrow.

Make no mistake, the wealth is there "but only there in bullion"! Because a free bullion market cannot be denied or controlled

----- when it stands between the opposite goals of political powers! ---

In this: it will separate from the politically crushing reality the current dollar based paper gold markets represents. The premium on bullion will soar!

The "Political will" of old world Europe is about to help make our investment real. For myself, a large percentage of my wealth is being saved by going with the evolution of paper moneys: not against!

This trend is visible now and based on the forward flow of human affairs, not the backward rules of money theory!

Our future is today; if not just around the trail!

A quick note from the "TrailHouse"! (smile)

You just have to give the devil his due,,,,,, Wim Duisenberg gave a clear signal today and his timing
allowed him to hit two birds with one rock.

First target: He has all of Political officialdom now holding their tongues because they learned that
the ECB is not the same animal as our Fed. From the link:

---- "Politicians have been scared of publicly pressing the independent ECB to act for fear it may
dig in its heels and remained cautious Monday" ----

Ha. Ha. They now know that these guys (ECB) are looking out for not only the money of a large
diverse group of nations, but perhaps a new bench mark currency a good portion of the rest of the
world may use. Their stance, recently, states that a currency should be valuable too and even offer
a real return for those that hold it for a while.

Don't expect Western dollar investors to fully taste this flavor just yet. But, they will as their local
economic structure begins to hold complete sway over the Feds actions. And all those deflation
boys thought our Fed would not inflate? Shoot, even our treasury in manning the guns now!

Second Target: Wait long enough for the US to have to drop dollar rates even lower before you move. "Watch him Alan,,,,,, Old Wim keeps his Euro biding a little higher than your dollar! I got a bad feeling about
this trend!"

---------------

Leigh,,, thanks for reading and thinking. I also want to thank everyone for using the fine services of
USAGOLD. Because then they further offer this entire forum library to further expand your understandings of gold. It takes a lot of effort by
everyone, who thinks and writes here, to offer such a broad spectrum of Gold thought.

---------

Gold has always been the most political metal our world has ever known; political because it offers
so much power to those that hold it in their hand. Many of the downtrodden look at government
policies and say:

-----"they dictate our wealth and put us in debt so as to control us"! -------

Conversely; A simple person can control his controllers by staying out of debt and owning a wealth
no government can dictate the value of: Gold Bullion!

GOLD:

-- value it with official contracts and currencies and your wealth is their power ,,,,,,,,,, keep it as your savings of ages,,, and your wealth becomes their master!

Words of a fool!

These are parts of several posts presented today on the main forum. This person does not know me or my associates. Indeed, most of us let blood for this country in a war long gone. I will say this for the record: Another is English and not Islamic!

But you have no trouble at all casting me in with the same evil that crashed into our nation on the 11th., do you? . Sir, you have spit upon the "flag" that waves outside my window. I do so now spit upon your name. You are not part of the same country I served!

I have spent years teaching and debating with men great and small. And have learned that only the mean ego of a useless fool uses such tactics. I am ashamed to have read your words at all and will do so no more. You are but a reflection of the very political hatred you condemn. It is a sad, sad day when someone wants your story silenced, so badly, that they resort to such comments. My spirit is low, I will walk this trail in silence.

-------------
-------However, I do not say "all paper will burn", and I definitely don't send demented religious fanatics to crash into the paper trading house and burn it down. -----

------ Finally, when FOA started putting forward his economic theories, I realized that he had spent too much time listening to an Islamic cleric who had not a clue as to economics.----------

------ So, from my vantage point of budding economist, FOA's explanations come down to being non-arguments and economic gibberish that would even shame Marx and Keynes. ----------

------ The motives of these people complaining of US defaults and monetary imperialism are simple: the greed for the unearned, envy grown of a zero sum view of social life that is characteristic of feudal societies such as Arabs still live in and Europe has barely made one step out of, and fear of their economic and financial future as a result of their stealing and wasting of their people's wealth. -------------

There comes a time

There comes a time in all things when one must do nothing and simply wait. This is an ages old truth that crosses all the boundaries of life's endeavors; for everything is not always in the doing, but also in the watching. Any good farmer knows that he does not grow a crop; he only prepares his field so the growing, he knows is coming, can take nature's course.

My friends, we have crossed time and space, while plowing these fields of understanding, and the unfolding drama before us must now sprout it's own life. For now, it is my time to watch the trail and let the crop develop. Indeed, it will and it will do so for all to see.

Enough has been said to prove our reasoning is true, especially when the fields become full and in a shade of physical green only our seeds will produce. And planted them, we did, by hand, one at a time, over many years.

Enough has also been said about myself as this story was never about me; perhaps too much untruth was also said by others?

I am going to travel for a while and watch the trail from a distance. It won't be long before the rains come and the ground begins to open; in that time I will return. Until then; this farmer will rest from this work.

Thank you USAGOLD and all the fine people that make this media the best gold site in the world! Another time, we WILL hike again.
